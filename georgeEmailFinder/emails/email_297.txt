Subject:Clause 27.1.1: Notice of Claim – Delay Notice No. 0169 [post-SAA8]
Failure to Issue an Engineer’s Instruction for Outstanding Doors Issues
Dear Sir,
We refer to our numerous letters issued to date informing you about the on-going outstanding issues
regarding the doors and specifically, letter ref: (1) expressing disappointment that you have elected to
issue an EI only for 41 nos. doors, disregarding the remaining hundreds of outstanding door issues.
Accordingly we hereby notify you pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 that
the various events and circumstances constitute acts of prevention and/or breaches of Contract on the
part of the Employer/Employer’s Personnel/Consultants giving rise of our right to claim:
(i)
An extension to the Time for Completion pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c); and
(ii)
An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.2 pursuant to Clause 9.10, or,
in the alternative, damages for breach of Contract.
That said, in spite of our contractual rights, we confirm that we have proceeded to complete the
Variation Works associated with the outstanding doors issues but our decision to proceed pending the
issuance of an EI, is without prejudice to our right to claim cost and time in this respect.
Yours faithfully,
