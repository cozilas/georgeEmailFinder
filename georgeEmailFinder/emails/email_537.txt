Subject: Unfair comments in response to Document Submittal DS/0401/8280 Rev.
Dear Sir,
The Contractor writes with reference to the receipt of the Engineer's Status Code 3 'Revise and
Resubmit' response to Document Submittal No. DS/0401/8280 Rev. 00 - 'ITF Interface Verification
Test Procedure for Fire Alarm System and Lighting Control System (FAS-LCS), and wishes to convey
its displeasure at the Engineer's unfair and unjustified comments issued in relation thereto.
The IVTP Test Cases have been derived and developed based on the approved FAS LCS lCD and no

reference of the Exit Route lighting scenarios were mentioned and commented in the approved lCD.
The Engineer is therefore urged to re-consider its comments forthwith and I or further elaborate
upon the basis of the current Status Code 3 response to Document Submittal No. DS/0401/8280
Rev. 00 and re-code the document to Code 2 to avoid the unnecessary prolonged approval process
and delay the Delivery schedule of the IVTPs.
Yours faithfully,
