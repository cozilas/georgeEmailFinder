Subject:FWD: Condition Survey for Areas between GH38 and GH41
Dear Sir,
With reference to the above subject in respect of the damages to the PQC, please find attached the
Engineer’s letter references (1) to (3) above which are self-explanatory.
Please note that the Engineer has conducted a joint condition survey of the outer and inner areas
between GH38 and GH41 and has recorded damages to the PQC texture and completed joint sealant at
different locations where the Subcontractor’s material was originally stored. The Engineer has enclosed
marked up layout plan highlighting the damaged locations along with relevant photos that show the
extent of the damages. The rectification of these damages will be carried out by the Other Contractor
L&T and associated repair/replacement charges may be levied against the Contractor’s account.
The Contractor believes that the Subcontractor is responsible for these damages and, whilst notifying
the Subcontractor of a possible event giving rise to a claim under the provisions of Clause 10.3
[Contractor Claims] and Clause 12.12 [Other Contractors and Other Subcontractors] of the Conditions of
Subcontract, it requests the Subcontractor provides its comments (if any) in relation to this incident.
Yours faithfully,
