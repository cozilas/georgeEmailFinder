Subject:Confidentiality and Security
Dear Sir,
With reference to the above subject, this is to inform you that an incident occurred recently with a
senior member of staff of one of our Subcontractors wandering through the floor commercial
department workstations, during a non-working Saturday.
In view of the above incident and to ensure that incidents of this nature will not reoccur we inform you
of the following:
1.
only TCAJV staff are allowed beyond reception;
2.
if you wish to see any member of TCAJV staff, you must first make telephone or e-mail contact
to make an appointment (that for example, can simply be a mobile call asking if the person is there and
if they can spare time to meet in the next ten minutes/hour/this afternoon);
3.
all such meetings are to be held in one of the commercial meeting rooms;
4.
anyone found in the commercial space without having made an arrangement to see a particular
TCAJV staff member will be considered to acting suspiciously and will be dealt with accordingly.
We therefore, request you to note the seriousness of this issue and act accordingly and as instructed.
Yours faithfully,
