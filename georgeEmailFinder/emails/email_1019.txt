Subject Clause 27.1.1- Delay Notice No. 1012
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to the above correspondence (1} wherein the Contractor submitted Delay
Notice No. 1012 regarding alleged delays to Contractor's PCA Pit Works due to the Inaction and/or
Outstanding Works of the Employer's Other Contractor (L&T).
The Engineer records that the submitted Delay Notice is not in accordance with Clause 27.1.1 of the
Conditions of Contract as it was not provided within the required 28 days from the date the Contractor
became aware of the alleged delay event.
Moreover, the information included in the above correspondence is inaccurate and doesn't represent
the actual situation. The enclosed summary status provides evidence of formal handover of 10 PCA Pit
and photographs for two PCA Pits that have been handed over lately (25.1 and 44.1}.
The Engineer highlights the Contractor's obligation to submit a fully detailed claim in accordance with
the requirements of Clause 27 .1.5 within 42 days from the date of the events which allegedly gave rise
to the alleged delay. Furthermore, the Contractor is also obligated to submit a Time Impact Analysis in
accordance with Clause 27.2.1 within 28 days in order to enable us to review any entitlement the
Contractor may have for additional time and/or cost.
In addition, the Contractor shall provide evidence that it took all reasonable steps to avoid or mitigate
the alleged delays as required under Clause 16.5.3 of the Conditions of Contract.
Compliance with the above stated contractual obligations is essential as t his will form part of the basis
of
the Engineer's assessment of the Co ntractor's submitted delaying events.
Yours faithfully,
