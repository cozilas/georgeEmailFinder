Dear Sir,

We refer to the Engineer's Assistant's letter reference 1) whereby we were requested to submit a
detailed quotation for the design of the Pedestrian Tunnel between Qatar National Museum Station and
the Museum Park including:

1.

The extent and detail of the scope;

2.

The financial offer to complete the works under item 1;

3.

The duration to complete the works under item 1.

Further to this request, we have duly asked the Lead Designer (ATKINS) to submit its detailed quotation.
We have now received this quotation and hereby forward it for your review. Please note that should this
quotation be accepted and the relevant design scope instructed for implementation, the financial
proposal will need to be adjusted to cater for the Contractor's mark-up as per the provisions of the
Contract.

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.
Yours faithfully,
