Delayed Access to Retail Unit Nos. 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2027 – Delayed Completion of the
Lighting Control Testing and Commissioning Works
Dear Sirs,
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
The events described in Annex A hereto, concern acts of prevention on the part of the Employer /
Employer’s Personnel / Consultants / Employer’s Other Contractor, denying us access to Retail Units:
2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, and 2027 which has delayed the completion of the Lighting Control
Testing and Commissioning.
Potential Impact
Acts of prevention on the part of others such as that outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
increasingly likely to impact on achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned immediately upon receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT
Background
On 24 February 2020, we issued Re-Entry Permit Nos. RDD-917 and RDD-722 requesting permission to
obtain access to and re-enter Retail Units (RU) Nos: 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2027 located at
CP Level 2.0 Sector 5.14C, to undertake Commissioning Inspections of the Lighting Control systems
(Table 1 refers):

In the event however, despite Re-Entry Permit Nos. RDD-917 and RDD-722 having been responded to on
25 and 27 February 2020 respectively, we were prevented from accessing RU Nos. 2021, 2022, 2023,

2024, 2025 and 2027 due to the occupation of the same areas by the Employer’s Other Contractor
(Tenant’s Works), which in turn, prevented us completing the Lighting Control Testing and
Commissioning Works. This is despite the fact that NOCs had been issued by you purportedly permitting
us to access each of the respective areas.
We wrote informing you this caused us to place our Commissioning Inspections “on hold” vide our email dated 1 March 2020 [3:56 PM], in the manner shown in Figure 1 below (copy attached at Annex B
hereto):
Figure 1
This act of prevention has both delayed and disrupted our Works, and have undeniably impacted upon
our ability to complete Testing and Commissioning and will invariably knock on and impact upon our
ability to achieve Milestone MS09B. Similarly, this has the potential to prevent us from achieving
Substantial Completion (i.e. Milestone MS09C). In view of this, then we hereby maintain all our rights
and entitlements under Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been
amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to the Time for Completion and the associated costs
arising from the same.
Yours faithfully,
