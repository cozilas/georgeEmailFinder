Subject: Engineer's Instruction (EI) for Investigation and Remediation of Sub-Surface
Cavity at Gate House [sic]
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to the cavity we have discovered around the Gatehouse 24, near to t he
sewer lines between manholes S2117 and S2118 and your letter referred above.
Please note that the instruction refers to further ground improvement effort s, i.e. survey and
investigations, and is beyond the definition of subsidence rectification works as described under
the Clause 5 of SAA8.
Hence, with our best intentions and being proactive in the matter, we would be handling this El as
a request for a ROM (Rough Order of Magnitude) Proposal, prior to the receipt of Variation Order
as defined under the Clause 2.29 of SAA8. Consequently, we will be providing the following:
(i) a price for the additional works;
(i i) a fragnet for the additional works; and
(iii) the integration of the fragnet within Programme Rev 11.2 to demonstrate the
effects (if any) on the Milestones.
Meanwhile, until such time as the necessary actions are taken by you and the Employer in
accordance with SAA8 Clause 2.29, we will not be implementing any additional works.
Finally, by copy of this letter to the Employer, we suggest that he notifies the h1sure r of this
requirement for these additional works as we believe that it may not be covered by the present
insurance claim for the subsided services around the Building
This is for your information, record and action accordingly.
Yours faithfully,
