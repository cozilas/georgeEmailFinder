Subject CP Main Roof Gypsum Board Replacement
Dear Sir,
With reference to the above subject and your letter {1), the Contractual basis for assessment and
determination of rejected materials and works has already been established and documented through
numerous correspondence referenced in Appendix A.
The Engineer's position with regards to defective materials that have been incorporated into the roof
remains unchanged. We refer you to the contents of our listed correspondence and reiterate that the
Works will remain rejected in accordance with Clause 15.4.1 until such time as the Contractor
demonstrates that defective roof materials have been removed and replaced.
Pursuant to Clause 15.4.2 of the Contract, we reserve the Employer's rights for any delays and/or
additional cost which may be caused due to the Contractor's non-compliance. No further
correspondence shall be accommodated in relation to this subject until such time the Contractor
implements the required corrective measure.
Yours faithfully,
