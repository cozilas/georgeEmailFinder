Table 1: Summary of valuation

The Contractor hereby provides its valuation of the adjustment to the Contract Price in the net amount
of QAR 5,997,598.06 as detailed in Attachments 1) to 6).

The Contractor’s assessment of the time impact shows that the completion of Entrance 2 will be delayed
by nine (9) months due the re-sequencing of the Works. This will extend the duration of TTM
accordingly. The Contractor is mitigating the time impact proactively in the proposed Programme.

The Contractor kindly requests the Engineer to secure the necessary land for the temporary site
installation.

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.

Yours faithfully,
