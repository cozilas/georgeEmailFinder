Dear All,
We need to provide a response to AECOM’s rebuttal of our Post-SAA8 Consolidated TIA No.2 (see
attached copy), and do so quickly.
Our response needs to address and rebut to the fullest extent possible, AECOM’s comments against
each delay notice that was used as the basis for preparing TIA No. 2.
We have taken the liberty of attaching a preliminary Scott Schedule where we have reproduced
AECOM’s comments against each notice. By going back into the background for preparing each notice,
we have been able to identify the person(s) within the TCA JV who provided the Contracts Team with
the necessary information in order to prepare the notice. Accordingly we seek your assistance in
providing a reply / rebuttal to the Engineer’s comments against each notice. Hence this e-mail.
You will note that for expediency and ease of reference, we have provide a link to the original delay
notice that the Engineer is commenting on.
Can you therefore kindly go through this list and where applicable provide us with your comments in the
space provided. I trust this is self-explanatory but if for any reason it is not, or you need clarification,
please liaise with me or Georgios asap.
This exercise and the rebuttal of the Engineer’s comments is extremely important. Therefore kindly
ensure your comments are returned urgently. Thank you.
Yours faithfully,
