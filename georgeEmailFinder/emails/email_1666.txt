Dear Sir,

We would like to thank you for your letter reference 1) responding to our clarification request under
letter reference.?).

We acknowledge your confirmation that the Engineer's Instruction refers to all changes contained
within the Codification Manual Rev 6.0 and that it is applicable from the date of issuance. However, we
suggest that the practical approach to this matter is that this date should be the date of your response
to our clarification, i.e. 08 June 2015 and kindly request your consent to this approach.

Further to the above, you are kindly requested to convene a meeting with the participation of all parties
in order to clarify the way forward and agree all necessary details for the implementation of the new
station names and the changes contained within the Codification Manual Rev 6.0.

Finally, we confirm that the Engineer's Instruction has no retrospective time and cost implications. We
are currently assessing if there will be any prospective impact arising from the application of the
Engineer's Instruction and shall inform you accordingly by 18 June 2015.

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification. Yours faithfully,
