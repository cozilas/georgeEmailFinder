Subject:Post SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0175
Late and Unreasonable Status Code 3 Comments Issued in Reply to Document Submittal No.
DS/0401/2875 Rev. 03 – Configuration Management Plan
Dear Sirs,
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
The matters described in Annex A concern delays to the progress and completion of the Works due to
the Engineer’s late and unreasonable Code 3 comments issued in response to Document Submittal No.
DS/0401/2875 Rev. 03, rejecting the previously approved ‘Configuration Management Plan’.

Potential Impact
Delays and disruption due to the events and circumstances outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
likely to impact on achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delays and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned immediately upon receipt of this e-notice.
Nevertheless, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
On 14 August 2019, we submitted DS/0401/2875 Rev. 03, seeking your approval of the Configuration
Management Plan (CMP) in the manner set out in Table 1 below. According to Section 1.0 ‘Scope’, the
CMP describes the overall technical and administrative direction and control of all systems under the
Master Systems Integration (MSI) scope during the Integration Test Facility (ITF) testing through the Site
testing and commissioning activities. The CMP is therefore of significant importance.

In addition to indicating when the CMP was submitted, the information recorded in Table 1 shows when
the response to DS/0401/2875 Rev. 03 was due and when the response was actually issued
Article 1.3 of Specification Section 013300 ‘Submittal Procedures’ governs the processing time by which
you are contractually obligated to respond to our submittals. On the basis that DS/0401/2875 Rev. 03 is
at Rev. 03 then this ought to have been responded to by you 7 calendar days later, i.e. by 21 August
2019. However, Table 1 shows that you exceeded the review periods expressly stipulated in the
Contract, by a total of 83 calendar days. At this stage of the Project, this delay is unacceptable.
We further record that your response to DS/0401/2875 Rev. 03 contains what we contend are a series
of additional and / or unreasonable Status Code 3 comments, despite DS/0401/2875 having previously
been granted Status Code 2 approval vide your reply to Rev. 02. By way of example:
•
Section 5.2.2.1.1 (No update made in the section, yet you have issued 3 additional comments in
the Code 3 version);
•
Section 5.2.2.1.3 (No update made in the section, yet you have issued 8 additional comments in
the Code 3 version);
•
Section 5.2.2.1.4 (No update made in the section, yet you have issued 1 additional comment in
the Code 3 version);
•
Section 5.2.2.1.6 (Minor update made in the section by changing the word "designate" to
Configuration Change Coordinator. However, yet you have issued 15 additional comments not in the
update but in the other paragraphs within the section);
•
Section 5.2.2.1.7 (No update made in the section, yet you have issued 5 additional comments in
the Code 3 version); and
•
Section 5.2.2.2.1 (No update made in the section, yet you have issued 3 additional comments in
the Code 3 version).
At the risk of being repetitive, all of the sections with your comments except for those that we had
previously updated and you had commented on, are new comments or comments that were not

provided in the previous Code 2, Rev. 02 of DS/0401/2875. For brevity, we have not repeated these
comments here, but nevertheless maintain that there was nothing to have prevented you from
identifying or bringing our attention to such comments during your review of DS/0401/2875 Rev. 02.
This unreasonable practice which erroneously identifies alleged comments has to cease forthwith, but in
the meantime continues to have major ramifications on the Project, particularly at this stage.
Resultant Impact:
Meanwhile, the protracted time taken by you to respond to DS/0401/2875 Rev. 03 coupled with your
unreasonable Code 3 comments, particularly at such a late stage of the Project has the potential to
delay and disrupt our Works. Specifically, the Configuration Management Plan is essential in so far as it
affects Testing and Commissioning, which is similarly essential in enabling us obtain the Building
Completion Certificate (BCC). This is critical to achieving Milestone MS09B. Consequently, the more you
unduly prolong the approval of CMP and subject it to unnecessary and unreasonable Status Code 3
comments, the more likely this will prevent us from achieving Substantial Completion (MS09C).
Yours faithfully,
