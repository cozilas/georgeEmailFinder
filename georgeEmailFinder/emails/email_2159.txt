Dear Sir,

referenced above. Contractor has failed to submit the quotation for any cost and time impact as
requested. EA confirms that the Contractor is required to submit a quotation for the proposal in letter

The Contractor is reminded that without a quotation, the Engineer is unable to make informed
decisions. As this request has been outstanding for some time the Contractor is required lo take
immediate action and submit without any further delay.

Failure to respond within seven (7) days of receipt of this reminder will lead the Engineer's Assistant to
constc r further action.

Yours faithfully
