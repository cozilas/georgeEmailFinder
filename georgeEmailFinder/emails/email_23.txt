Subject:Notice for Late Arrival of Workers on Dewa Project
Dear Sir,
With reference to the above subject, it has come to our attention that on 21 November 2020, a number
of your dayshift workers, specifically 12 nr., working on SRWO Project in Jebel Ali, reported late to work.
Please be informed that the dayshift starts at 07:00 AM and your manpower is strictly required to follow
the timings of the project and be available to start work at the mentioned time.
Please note that failure to follow the correct timings will have a negative effect on our site operations
and our work productivity, which will not be accepted.
Therefore, this letter serves as a written notice that punctuality and attendance on-site is recorded at all
times. Any failure to comply with the correct timings of the project may result in fines imposed on your
monthly invoices.
Please ensure that appropriate steps are being taken on your part to prevent such events in the future.
Yours faithfully
