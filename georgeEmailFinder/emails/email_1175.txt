Subject: Schedule of OHP% & Manpower Supply Rates for Back Charge Account
Dear Sir,
In line with our support to all the Subcontractors who may require our assistance for supplying of
labours,
materials, plants, tools, equipment or any facilities in connection with their respective Scope of Works,
please be informed Over Head and Profit (OHP) %shall be applicable as shown in the enclosed schedule.
Accordingly, we would refer you to Schedule 0, Scope of Work Clause 4.2.44 for your information with
regards to our entitlement to charge OHP% as described below:
"The Subcontractor is responsible to provide all supervision, labour, materials, tools, plant,
equipment etc., establishment costs, material storage facilities on and off site, overheads
and profit and all other items deemed necessary to complete the aforementioned works in
its entirety in a safe and competent manner. The Main Contractor will not provide any
materials related to the Sub-contract Works."
We believe the above Subcontract Clause is self-explanatory. Nevertheless, upon your request to utilise
our facilities, or in the event that we have carried out on your behalf upon your failure to perform any
part of your Scope of Works, the above OHP% shall be deemed applicable and the same will be
incorporated in your back charge account accordingly. Please be advised the aforementioned OHP% and
rates shall be adjusted without prior notice as and when deemed necessary.
We hope the above clarifies the situation.
Yours faithfully,
