Table 1 – DAF Pending Payments for Variation
As shown in Table 1 and discussed above, there is a cumulative overdue payment for Variations and
others amounting to AED 536,170.40. The overdue payment, is a result of non-certification on your part,
for the following executed works:
•
Additional works requested by you, associated with the ‘Rebar loading and sorting of rebars’, as
discussed in our letter ref: (1) above;
•
Additional works requested by you, associated with the provision of a Surveyor with equipment,
as discussed in our letter ref: (1) above;
•
Additional works claimed by us associated with the provision of a QA/QC engineer, as discussed
in our letter ref: (1) above;
•
The non-certification of wall starters, as discussed in our letter ref: (2) above.
In addition to the above, at the date of writing, the payment for our IPA No. 009 is 24 days overdue and
IPA No. 010 will be due for payment on 30 December 2020 as shown in Table 2 below. We trust both
payments for the said IPAs, will be released by 30 December 2020.

We reiterate once more, that the payment delays and the non-certification of works are causing
detrimental cashflow and financial issues to our company, and consequently have a negative impact on
the works.
In view of the above, we kindly request you to proceed with the release of our pending payments and
correction of the IPCs’ as explained above.
Lastly, we note that we have not received yet the contract for Building 49 - Wastewater Tanks.
Nevertheless, in good faith, we are continuing to progress with the works while awaiting the issuance of
the contract. We put on record that we have submitted our offer as per your request on 4 November
2020, and this offer was accepted with the release of the Advance Payment and IPA No. 1 for Building 49
- Wastewater Tanks.
We trust you find the aforementioned self-explanatory and clarifies the matter, and you will carry out
the necessary action as a matter of urgency.
Yours faithfully,
