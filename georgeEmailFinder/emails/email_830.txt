Subject: Notice to Correct / Delay Notice for HPC-01 Works
Dear Sir,
With reference to the above subject and in continuation to the numerous correspondences between us
about the backcharges applied related to the provision of drinking water and ablution and the delay in
the commencement of works related to HPC-01, this is to put on record your refusal to proceed with the
works. Please note that your failure and refusal to proceed with the works is a breach of the Subcontract
Agreement.
Kindly be informed that Subcontract Clause 22.1 [Notice to Correct], states that "If the Subcontractor
fails to carry out any obligation under the Subcontract, the Contractor may by notice require the
Subcontractor to make good the failure and to remedy it within a specified reasonable period.".
Therefore, you are instructed pursuant to Clause 11.3 [Instructions of the Contractor] of the
Subcontract, to immediately proceed with the works, particularly HPC-01 related works, within three (3)
days of receipt of this letter, to complete the aforementioned works.
We also put on record your statement as per your email correspondences received, that you will
suspend the works until this matter is resolved. Please note that in case you suspend the works without
any contractual basis, we will have no other option than to proceed with all necessary actions to protect
the interest of this Project. Therefore, we believe it is in the best interest of all parties to resolve and
conclude these issues as soon as possible.
In view of the above, please be informed that any delays, costs, losses and/or expenses and the like
incurred by us and/or Other Sub-Contractors arising as a result of your failure to complete the
aforementioned activities will be solely your responsibility pursuant but not limited to Clauses 10.3
[Contractorâ€™s Claims], 12.12 [Other Contractors and Other Subcontractors] and 16.6.1 [Delay Damages].
As mentioned above, all associated costs will be backcharged from your account according to the
Conditions of the Subcontract Agreement.
Yours faithfully,
