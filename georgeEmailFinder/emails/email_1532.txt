(received via reference 3) to suspend the design of "Alignment of Tunnel sections at Al Rayyan to Doha
Zoo" and "Alignment of Tunnel sections at Al Rayyan to Muaither' ("the Event"), the Contractor hereby
encloses its formal interim submission (Revision 0) for Claim Nr 036 in accordance with GC 8.4.4, GC
8.9.1 and GC 20.1.6.

As the Event has a continuing effect, the attached submission is to be considered as interim in

with respect to the Event at monthly intervals as required by GC 20.1.6(b).

Yours faithfully,
