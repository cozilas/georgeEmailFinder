Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to the Engineer's Assistant's ("EA") letter at reference 2 (received by the
Contractor on 20 June 2015) which states:

" With reference to clause 5.1.2.d of the Conditions of Contract, please hnd enclosed tor your
information the Baseline Station Are Planning Drawings for the following stations ...These drawings have
been produced by MMUP Central Planning Office in consultation with the relevant stakeholders"
(emphasis added).

The EA states that such drawings are issued for the Contractor's "information." The meaning of such a
statement has been clarified by the EA within its letter at reference 1 in which the EA states: "...as the
drawings are for information only they do not change the Employer 's requirements or Contractor's
obligations under the Contract." For this reason the EA further states within reference 1 that "No
instruction will be issued" for drawings issued for information only.

Accordingly, as the Baseline Station Area Planning Drawings ("BSAP") have been issued for information
only with respect to General Condition ("GC") 5.1.2(d), the EA is effectively stating that such drawings
contain no change to the Employer's Requirements or to the Contractor's obligations under the Contract
with respect to the Contractor's obligation to obtain the relevant Authority approval for the Contractor's
Design Documents.

The Contractor is therefore currently reviewing these BSAP drawings to check whether such drawings do
or do not contain a Variation i.e. a change to the Employer's Requirements or the Works (as defined
within GC
1.1.6.17 of the Contract). Should this review demonstrate that these BSAP drawings do represent a
Variation as before described, the Contractor shall then duly notify the EA requesting the appropriate
Engineer's Instruction to be issued.
Yours faithfully,
