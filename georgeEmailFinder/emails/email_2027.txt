Dear sir

Further to WorleyParsons' above referenced letter (Reference # 3), WorleyParsons-Acciona now
estimated the time and cost to implement the Engineer's Instruction (Reference # 2) regarding the
deletion of the Pedestrian Connection and Entrance adjacent to Al Shamouk tower at YWST020 (Al Sadd
Station), and accordingly prepared the Scope Change Order (SCO) (Attachment 4), based on the current
executed model.
We attach herewith for your approval duly completed Scope Change Order (SCO) # 013. Kindly sign and
return to us the SCO at the earliest.
We remain at your disposalfor any further information and/or clarification.

Yours faithfully,
