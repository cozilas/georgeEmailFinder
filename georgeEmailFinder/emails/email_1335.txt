We refer to our above referenced letter in respect of continued delays to the manufacturing & delivery
of Air Handling Units.
We remain extremely concerned over the lack of commitment that you have shown towards the latest
manufacturing delay of the Central Processor 43 no. LBl Air Handling Units within the the 3'd 200 Days
Look-ahead Schedule and Baseline Programme. We wish to record yet again that the manufacturing &
delivery situation has deteriorated with no units on site as on this date.
It is again clear that the repeated failure by the vendor 'JCI' to comply with earlier assurances to fulfill
the scheduled dates is adversely affecting the Works, which are now in further delay. (having been
deferred from an end date of 25 May to 31 August, 2014).
We would remind you of the absolute importance of the Air Handling Units to the Project and the
'critical path' of same, yet despite this and earlier problems & regular reminders, you have been unable
to provide any assurances
Yours faithfully,
