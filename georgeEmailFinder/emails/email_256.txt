Subject: Request for Outstanding Cost Substantiation for EOT 1

Dear Sir,
The Contractor hereby requests the Subcontractor to provide the outstanding prolongation cost
substantiation under EoT 1 for the following period;
April 2014 to May 2014
The Subcontractor has provided prolongation cost substantiation for periods in relation to EoT 1 & EoT 2
previously; however, the Contractor is also assessing your costs in relation to the period stated above.
From our records, the Subcontractor has not yet provided the requested prolongation cost
substantiation
for this period.
The Contractor requests the Subcontractor to submit within 14 days of receipt of this letter the
outstanding Cost Substantiation as requested by the Contractor. The Contractor notes that should the
Subcontractor fail to provide the requested Cost Substantiation, it would prejudice the outcome of the
Subcontractor's Entitlement (if any) for Prolongation Costs under EoT 1.
Furthermore, if the Contractor does not receive the requested Cost Substantiation within 14 days of
receipt of this letter, the Contractor shall assume that the Subcontractor has waived any and all
entitlement during the periods that the Subcontractor has failed to provide either the requested
detailed
Cost Substantiation, or satisfactory Substantiation.
For the avoidance of doubt the request by the Contractor for the outstanding Cost Substantiation is not,
of itself, to be considered as an admission of any entitlement to an extension of the Time for Completion
and/or payment of additional Costs, nor does it constitute a waiver of any of the terms of the
Subcontract.
Yours faithfully,
