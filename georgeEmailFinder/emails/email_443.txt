Subject:Clause 27.1.1: Notice of Claim
Delay Notice No. 0035 (Post SAA8) – Instruction to hold all ceiling activities to the SEHA
Clinic due to EI No. 758 and subsequent instruction to resume work
Dear Sir,
We hereby submit this Delay Notice No. 0035 in accordance with the General Conditions Clause 16.5.2
and Sub-Clause 27.1.1, for the delays associated with the requirement to place a “hold” on the ceiling
works to the SEHA Clinic, and the subsequent instruction to resume works, described below:
On 3 October 2018, we received EI No. 758 appended to your letter dated 2 October 2018, identified at
ref: (1) instructing us, pursuant to General Conditions Clauses 11.3 and 20.1.1(b), “to provide a Rough
Order of Magnitude (ROM) and proposal, for the Modifications to the SEHA Clinic (4 pages)…”
Thereafter, we received an e-mail from you on 22 October 2018 [at 12:28 pm], ref: (2) instructing us to
“stop all ceiling activities in SEHA clinic due to the upcoming changes as per EI 758”. This same
instruction was echoed in a further e-mail from you on the same date, at 2:38 pm, ref: (3), where we
were ordered to “hold the [ceiling] works to minimize further impacts to the assessment of EI 758.”

Meanwhile, we complied with your request described in EI No. 758 (ref: 1) and on 27 November 2018
issued the ROM by way of Proposal Request Response Ref. PRR/0401/0004-TCAJV Rev. 00 (ref: 4); in
which we advised you that if in the event the modification works subject to EI No. 758 would not
proceed, then the impact of any delay would be dealt with as a separate delay event as opposed to
being addressed as part of any future time and cost record to be agreed prior to issuance of a VO.
However the works failed to be instructed and it is for this reason that we write to you now.
Specifically on 20 February 2019, during the Chairman’s Progress Meeting, the Employer directed us to
continue to construct the works to the SEHA Clinic in accordance with the latest IFC information and
cease contemplating undertaking any further works subject to EI No. 758 – our letter dated 20 February
2019 (ref: 5) regarding the ‘cancellation of works’ is synonymous with this very matter.
You responded to our letter on 28 February 2018 vide letter ref: (6) confirming “…that the Employer
does not wish to proceed with the Variation proposal for the modifications to the SEHA Clinic…”
We complied with the Employer’s and your directives in this regard also.
However, we remind you that the Contract does not provide for you to simply ‘tell’ us to place works
“on hold”; but it does permit you to ‘Suspend Works’, which we consider you unequivocally ordered [in
respect of the works described above] by way of your e-mails dated 22 October 2018 (ref. 1 and 2);
despite the absence of any reference to Conditions of Contract Clause 16.7 (Suspension of Work). This
also applies to your letter dated 28 February 2018 and the absence any reference to Conditions of
Contract Clause 16.11 (Resumption of Work) confirming the Employer’s directive ‘resume’ work.
Meanwhile, in a further e-mail also dated 22 October 2018 (timed at 5:49pm) (identified at ref: 7), we
advised you that in consequence of your directive to “hold the works” in the SEHA Clinic, “we have to
deduct 14 rooms from the target milestone of October” as the rooms were targeted to be completed in
October. Your response issued on 23 October 2018 (at 7:47am) (identified at ref: 8), simply stated
“agreed”. Consequently, it remains to be seen what if any critical impacts have been caused.
Notwithstanding, in consideration of the events outlined above, and accordance with Conditions of
Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1, we hereby notify you of our entitlement to claim:
(i)
An extension of the Time for Completion of the Works pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.9.1(a) i.e.
‘Consequence of Suspension’ as a result of a Suspension and Resumption of Works; and
(ii)
An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.2 pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.9
‘Consequence of Suspension’.
Interim and / or final details of the Time impacts and adjustment to the Contract Price, will be provided
in due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.5(a), (b) and (c).
Yours faithfully,
