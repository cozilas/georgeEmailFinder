RE: Condition Survey for Area GH 43-45
Dear Sir,
The Contractor confirms receipt of the letter referenced above on 01 October 2018, wherein the
Engineer
advised of having conducted a joint condition survey of the outer and inner areas between GH44 and
GH45

on 09 September 2018 following the Contractor's evacuation of the area. The Engineer further stated in
its
letter that it has "recorded damages to the PQC texture and completed joint sealant at different
locations
where TCA-JV's material was originally stored". To be clear:
1. . The Engineer's letter contained a generalized statement that neither described the damage nor
identify
its root cause. The Engineer simply made reference to damages found at different locations where the
Contractor's materials were apparently stored.
2. The area in question is accessible to other third parties as well and the alleged damages could have
been
caused by anyone, including L& T themselves.
3. The Contractor contends that tyre marks cannot be considered as damage to concrete, owing to the
fact
that the passenger boarding bridges (a permanent assembly) will produce tyre marks, similar to those
shown in the photograph provided by the Engineer, during its operation.
4. The photographs showed concrete cracks, gaps and holes which can be caused by a myriad of
reasons;
reasons such as concrete shrinkage, creep, insufficient concrete support and poor workmanship. The
cracks and gaps obviously affected the concrete joint sealant's appearance and performance.
In view of the above and in the absence of any evidence to support the accusation, the Contractor
rejects the
Engineer's supposition in tagging the Contractor as responsible for these damages. In a similar way, the
Contractor does not accept the Engineer's statement that "repair/replacement charges will be evaluated
and
the appropriate mechanism under the Contract for the deduction of monies shall be implemented".
Yours faithfully,
