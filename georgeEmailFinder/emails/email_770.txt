Subject: Notice to Correct- Continuous failure to provide adequate Supervision
Dear Sir,
Further to our email reminder referenced in (3) above, in addition to our numerous reminders through
meetings and telecommunication, we hereby put on record your continuous failure to provide adequate
supervision for your scope of works. Please note that this has resulted in poor workmanship as well as
persistent failure to complete mock-up/benchmark timeously.
We further put on record that your Project Manager (Mr Andree Exner) violated Project HSE
requirements
by going to site using a temporary pass and without first completing the safety induction. In this regard,
you have been penalised with a fine of AED 5,000.00 along with a AED 150.00 fine for him not wearing
eye
protection.
In view of the above failure, we hereby issue you this Notice to Correct in accordance with Subcontract
Clause 22.1 [Notice to Correct] which state;

11 /f the Subcontractor fails to carry out any obligation under the Subcontract the Contractor may by
notice
require the Subcontractor to make good the failure and to remedy it within a specified reasonable
period. "
Therefore, you are hereby instructed to provide adequate and qualified Supervision for your scope of
works within seven (7) days from receipt of this letter. In the interim and in the absence of your Project
Manager, please note that TCAJV will be providing supervision on your behalf hence all relevant costs
(inclusive of our applicable ad min fee) associated with the provision of such supervision will be
recovered
from your account in accordance with Clause 10.3 [Contractor's Claims] of the Subcontract.
Yours faithfully,
