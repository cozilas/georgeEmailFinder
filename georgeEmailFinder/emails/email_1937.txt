Dear Sir,
From continuous reviews of Contractor's tunneling programme and the poor daily rate of TBMs 1 and 2,
the Engineer's Assistant is becoming increasingly concerned that Contractor will not achieve the KITO,
STKID 04 date of 31 July 2016, nor the KITO TNTO date of 31 January 2017 in accordance with Volume 5,
Appendix F Sections 81 Tunnel Sections and D Specific Events.
From an analysis, recovery requirements in order to achieve the KITO date would indicate that:
•

For a six (6) day recovery programme TBM 1 would need to achieve 16.8 m per day and TBM 2

would need to achieve 16.5 m per day
•
For a seven (7) day recovery programme TBM 1 would need to achieve 14.4 m per day and TBM
2 would need to achieve 14.1 m per day.

The Engineer's Assistant requires the Contractor to consider the current performance level of each TBM
and submit a detailed recovery mitigation plan that will clearly demonstrate Contractor's ability to meet
the referenced KITO date above.

Contractor should consider the above bullet points in addressing and developing their mitigation plan.
The plan is to be submitted to the Engineer's Assistance by no later than Wednesday, 08 July 2015.
Yours faithfully,
