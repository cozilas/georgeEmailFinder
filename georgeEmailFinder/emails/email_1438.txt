Dear Sir,
The Contractor met this morning with representatives of the Employer and the Engineer's Assistant in an
attempt to determine a way, for the expeditious management of the Project, to minimise the volume of
notices served under General Conditions ("GC") 20. 1.
The Engineer's Assistant's letter on the subject at ref 2, stated that:
"We conclude that, if the Contractor considers that a variation has the potential to become a claim, then
a "Claim Notice" is required to be submitted in accordance with Sub-Clause 20.1, irrespective of the fact
that such notice may be issued at the same time as a "Variation notice" and/or an "extension of Time
notice.""
It was agreed that the Engineer's Assistant would revisit this position in further correspondence,
nevertheless until and unless an interpretation different from the preceding one is arrived at and agreed
between the Employer and the Contractor, the Contractor is compelled to continue to serve notices in
order to protect his Entitlements.
Regrettably therefore, the Contractor refers to the Engineer's Instruction at ref 1 and hereby notifies the
Engineer's Assistant of the Contractor's intention to claim for its perceived entitlement for extension to
the Time(s) for Completion and additional cost in accordance with General Conditions 8.4.2, 13.6.1 and
20.1.2 of Volume 3 of the Contract.
Notwithstanding the foregoing the Contractor confirms that it will endeavor to incorporate the changes
Instructed through Engineer's Instruction within the Time for Completion while keeping any additional
costs to a minimum.

Yours faithfully,
