Dear Sirs,
As you are aware there are explicit and implicit responsibilities within your Subcontract that require you
to warrant that you have scrutinised reviewed and checked all Project information and bring to our
attention any discrepancies errors or omissions that may give rise to an adverse impact on the
Completion of the Works.
As we approach the most critical stage of the Project we feel it prudent to bring these responsibilities to
the fore as a reminder that it will not be acceptable to attempt a future position based upon any matter
that it can be shown should have been raised for the Engineerâ€™s determination earlier.
We are not aware of any such matters that have not been raised by you prior to the date of this letter:
unless you inform us in writing to the contrary within seven days we shall continue to rely upon your
professional expertise, skill, care and judgement in this respect.
Yours faithfully,
