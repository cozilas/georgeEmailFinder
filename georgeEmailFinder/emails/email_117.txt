Subject COVID-19 Reporting
Dear Sir,
We write to convey the Employer's directive with regard to the appropriate reporting protocols for
suspected COVID-19 cases associated within the MTC Programme.
The Contractor is required to follow these instructions without exception, update their internal plans
and procedures to incorporate and communicate throughout the Contractor's staff accordingly.
We appreciate the current concerns in relation to COVID-19, however it is paramount that all
communications are accurate, informative, and professional at all times.
On a further note, we expect the Contractor to fully implement and maintain all their COVID-19
contingency and preventative arrangements at all times as well as demonstrating full compliance with
all MTC Programme requirements and local authority directives. The Contractor is required to conduct
regular compliance checks to assess their alignment with all these requirements.
Thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation.
Yours faithfully,
