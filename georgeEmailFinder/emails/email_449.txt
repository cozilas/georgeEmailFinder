Subject Clause 27.1.5(a): Interim Particulars - Delay Notice No.0046 - The Engineer's
Overdue Responses to the Contractor's Mechanical Requests for Information (RFI)

Dear Sir,
We write with reference to the above correspondence (1) wherein the Contractor submitted the
Interim Particulars in relation to Delay Notice No. 0046 issued via (4) for the alleged delay subject:
"The Engineer's Overdue Responses to the Contractor's Mechanical Requests for Information (RFI)- as
at 14 February 2019".
The Contractor at the Risk Committee Meeting that was held on 10 March 2019 stated that there is no
current impact on the critical path for the submitted E-Notices. The Contractor's statement at the Risk
Committee Meeting is also supported by the fact that the Contractor's Monthly Programme updates
do not show any impact to the Substantial Completion Date.
We also record that the Contractor in correspondence (1) has not evidenced the impact of the alleged
delay to its programme and has not stated the implemented mitigation measures for the avoidance of
the alleged delay in accordance with the Programme Project Controls Requirements (Clause 1.3.7).
Furthermore, the Contractor has failed to submit a Time Impact Analysis within 28 days as required
under Clause 27.2 .1 of the Conditions of Contract.
The Contractor is aware that a Time Impact Analysis along with a concurrency analysis are required to
be submitted in order to enable the Engineer to review the Contractor's allegations.
In light of the above, we consider that the Contractor has not substantiated any entitlement to an
extension to the Time for Completion.
Yours faithfully,
