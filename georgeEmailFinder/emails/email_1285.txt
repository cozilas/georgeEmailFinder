Dear Sir,
The Contractor refers to NCR no 850 and NCR no 869 received by the Contractor in relation to the
settlement of the sewer pipelines and manholes along the perimeter of the MTB. The Contractor
records
the following in this regard:
The reason/s for the settlement is unknown at present and therefore the Engineer/Employer has
verbally
instructed the Contractor to investigate and determine the reason/s behind the settlement. The
Contractor in carrying out this investigatory process is incurring additional Costs (including but not
limited
to: Staff, Labour, Plant, Equipment, appointment of several Subcontractors). At present the following
Subcontractors have been appointed by the Contractor:
Name of Subcontractor Scope of Work
KMG CCTV Inspection of settled sewer lines
Baynounah Laboratories Site Investigation
Robert Bird Specialist Geotechnical Consultant
The Contractor is expending tremendous effort (both time and cost) to conclude the investigatory
process. The Contractor asserts that it is of paramount importance that the Engineer, as well the sewer
network designer (NACO), fully participate and agree on how the investigatory process is to be
conducted,
in order to avoid expending unnecessary time and cost.
Furthermore, as at the date of this letter, the reason/s for the settlement is unknown, the Engineer and
the Parties have not agreed as to which Party is liable for the settlement of the sewer pipelines and
manholes, and therefore ultimately responsible for the rectification of the pipelines and manholes. If it
is
found that the Contractor is not liable for the settlement of the pipelines and manholes, the Contractor
reserves its right to claim for all Costs that has been, and will be incurred, due to this issue.
Yours faithfully
