Subject Damage following Rainfall Event on lOth November 2019
Dear Sir,
We refer to the rainfall event on 101h November 2019 and refer the Contractor to the attached
damage reports both within and external to the building.
The Contractor is to immediately investigate the root causes for the water ingress into the building
and to immediately take action to rectify all damaged works and take all necessary steps to arrest all

pathways for water ingress and ensure that the building envelope is not compromised in any way. This
includes but is not limited to the cleaning of gutters, drainage channels at both roof and apron/ road
levels.
For the external works, it is critical that all utilities and associated infrastructure entering the building
are fully sealed to prevent the transit of rainwater into the building. We also note the accumulation of
water into the open trenches and highlight the need for the re-evaluation of temporary works, further
availability of pumps to rapidly remove rainwater from open trenches and to conduct further testing
and re-compaction of material to mitigate against any potential settlement of the fill material.
It is noted that there is further inclement weather expected so the Contractor is to take immediate
action to safeguard their works.
Yours faithfully,
