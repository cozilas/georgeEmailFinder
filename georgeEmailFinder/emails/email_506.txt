Subject: Site Observation Prior to Screed Cracks & Damages in CP Level 2.0
Dear Sir,
This correspondence refers to the above mentioned subject and project.
Ref:

MMM/19/MTB/023 '
It was observed that TCA JV has already opened the access and allowed the use to pedestrians and
deliveries above a newly casted screed in zone 27 after less than 48 hours from casting completion.
The screed has been casted only on February 14th and the drop hammer test is to be executed after 14
days from date of casting in order to assure that the screed has reached its full strength as per our
approved Method Statement.
Such action has already resulted in visible and extensive damages to the screed compromising its quality

and chemical repairs will be futile is such case.
Kindly note that Mosart will not be held responsible for any damages to the screed and to the stone yet
to be installed and all additional repairing works resulting from such action to be done will be
backcharged to TCA JV.
Yours faithfully,
