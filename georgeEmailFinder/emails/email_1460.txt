Dear Sir,

Reference is made to the Engineer's letter/Instruction No. 74 at reference 2 above,(received by the
Contractor on 19 August 2015).

The Contractor considers that this Engineer's Instruction constitutes a variation and hereby notifies the
Engineer's Assistant of the Contractor's intention to claim for its perceived entitlement for adjustment
to the Contract Price for payment of the additional costs, incurred due to the El number 74 Variation, in
accordance with General Conditions 3.3.3.

The Contractor also refers to letter reference 1 above, and therefore also hereby gives notice under
Clause
20.1.2 of volume 3 of the Contract.

Notwithstanding the foregoing the Contractor confirms it will endeavor to keep additional costs in
connection with the El number 74 Variation to a minimum.

Yours faithfully,
