Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer's Assistant's letter at reference 1 above,the Contractor encloses the ALYSJ JV
proposed strategy for mock-ups.

The Contractor notes that the above will be subject to the receipt of an Engineer's Instruction upon the
expenditure of the relevant Architectural Finishes Provisional Sums in accordance with Sub-Clause 13.7
.1 of the General Conditions of Contract (Volume 3).

Instruction to proceed is required immediately in order for the mock-ups to be procured, fabricated, and
completed within the current CMP schedule.

We trust the enclosed is in order and look forward to discussing the matter further. Yours faithfully,
