Subject:Omission of Additional Glass Wall Lining at CP Level 3.0 under Clauses 22.2.4 and 20
Dear Sir,
Further to our letter referenced in (2) above, in addition to numerous Notices, we further put on record
your persistent failure to make good and remedy such failures within the stipulated timeframe. On
account of such failures, we hereby notify you that we have elected to omit the additional Glass Wall
Lining from your scope of works, at CP Level 3.0 (GLZ-16 â€“ Approximately 3,000m2) as identified in
Schedule 1, enclosed to this Notice.
We expressly reserve our rights derived from the Subcontract Agreement to subsequently notify you of
further omissions of sections of the Subcontract Works, on account of your failure to comply with the
Final Notice issued previously.
We will shortly issue you with a Variation Order for the omission of the sections of the Subcontract
Works identified herein and we confirm that, in accordance with Clause 22.2.4 [Termination by

Contractor for Subcontractor Default], the provisions of Clause 22.3 [Consequences of Termination for
Subcontractor Default] and 22.5 [Payment after Termination for Subcontractor Default] shall apply to
the omitted sections.
The omissions of sections of the Subcontract Works are without prejudice to all of our other rights under
the Subcontract, including our right to instruct further subsequent omissions.
However, please be advised that the rest of the Glass Wall Lining excluded from the aforesaid omission,
remain your scope of works therefore you are urged to continue with their execution without any
further delay.
We trust you find the above self-explanatory and we look forward to your continued action and support
on this project.
Yours faithfully,
