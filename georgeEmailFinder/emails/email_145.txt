Subject:Notification of Settlement Observed to Landside Roads PR10 and PR11 Following Rainfall Event
Occurring in January 2020 – Request for Engineer’s Instruction
Dear Sirs,
We refer to the various e-mails exchanged between ourselves as well as NACO within the period from
24 February 2020 to 2 March 2020, specifically the e-mails referenced at (1) to (5) above.
On 24 February 2020 (ref: 1) we received an e-mail from you attaching the “latest Landside Monitoring
Survey as of 23 February 2020”. This was followed by receipt of NACO’s e-mail dated 24 February 2020
(ref: 2) which advised of the following observation: “A number of locations have shown a jump in
settlement since the rains in Jan 2020 of over 50mm. Given this is Landside, is someone looking into
this?
This comment prompted the issuance of your e-mail dated 2 March 2020 (ref: 3) in which you advised
NACO that “Yes, we are aware of the movement in one localised area at Landside, and are continuing to
monitor same (see attached “Road Monitoring PR-11” which is specific to this area). As stated in our
weekly meetings, we have issued a NCR and letter to the Contractor regarding same and await the
Contractor’s proposal to resolve this issue.” While in the same e-mail you requested us to attend a brief
meeting with you “in order to discuss the Contractor’s proposal.” [Underlined for emphasis]
Your response caused us to issue two e-mails. On 2 March 2020 [11:17 AM] (ref: 4) we advised you “The
settlement was identified and notified being at one location at landside and … [was] … also recorded
even before the recent rain of Jan. We await your instruction in this regard. Bear in mind that we plan
to have our wearing course soon and this settled location must be cleared before wearing course.”
While on 2 March 2020 [11:24 AM] (ref: 5) we issued a follow up e-mail clarifying that the settlement
values had increased significantly since the January 2020 rainfall, and on the basis that the landside zone
is a clear cut zone not fill zone, then it is not for us to provide any proposal to resolve this issue.
We once again reiterate that we are not the designers for this Project. Therefore as noted in the closing
sentence of our e-mail (ref: 5), we await your further direction and an instruction on this issue in order
to move forwards with your design solution to rectify the settlement to Landside Roads PR10 and PR11.
We also record that on 5 March 2020, we received an ‘open’ response to Non-Conformance No: MTCCMA-0401-CM-NCR-01492 (ref: 6), concerning observed settlement to asphalt and manholes (PM-2011
and TRM-2032) also at PR11. In this, you insisted that we conduct exploratory boreholes to investigate
the underlying ground conditions. However, on the basis that we have consistently maintained that we
are not responsible for the settlement and that as noted above, we are awaiting receipt of your design
solution to rectify the same to Landside Roads PR10 and PR11 then we categorically reject NCR-01492.
Yours faithfully,
