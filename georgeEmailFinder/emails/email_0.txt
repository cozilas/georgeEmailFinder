Dear Sir,
We write with reference to the enclosed quotation referenced in (3) and LPO in (4) above, to inform you
that we have placed an order for the material on your behalf due to your failure to fulfill your
subcontract obligations in a timely manner.
We regret to inform you that your lack of co-ordination and your delay in execution of the works in the
aforesaid location ahead of the MEP Subcontractor in a timely manner, has resulted in the clash
between the AC duct and the Stone Steel Free Standing structure.
You are once again reminded to be conversant with the Subcontract clause 12.12.2 regarding the coordination with the Contractor and other Subcontractors.
We hereby notify you of our intention to back charge the cost associated with the works from your
account according to the Conditions of Subcontract Clause 10.3 (Contractorâ€™s Claims) and Clause 12.12
(Other Contractors and Other Subcontractors).
In addition, we shall back charge any amount that falls under your responsibility in accordance to Clause
10.3.5 and 11.4, whereby you are liable to the Contractor for the costs arising out of your failure to
perform your obligations under the Subcontract.
This is for your information record and necessary action.
Yours faithfully,
