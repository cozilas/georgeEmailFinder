Subject:Re: Pre Emigration lnfoPanels and Counters; Site installation co-ordination.
Dear Sir,
We are in receipt of your letter referenced (1) above, in which you informed us about the conditions in
the locations at Level 2.0 Central Processor where you were not able to proceed with your works, due to
other Subcontractors works.
In view of the above, this is to confirm that the issues in the areas discussed in your letter have been
resolved and you were able to proceed with the completion of your works respectively.
We are also taking this opportunity to request you to always liaise with our construction team to
coordinate your works as per Clause 12.12 [Other Contractors and Other Subcontractors] to work on
other available work-fronts to avoid any delays. This can be established by means of continuous
communication with our construction team and other Subcontractors, which will provide you with a
good understanding of all available work fronts and necessary resources required.
We trust the above is clear and consider this matter closed.
Yours faithfully,
