Dear Sir,
This is an instruction under Sub-Clause 13.1.1of the General Conditions of Contract to initiate a
variation. The nature and extent of the variation is provided below.

The South Eastern entrance adjacent to Al Shamouk tower is deferred from the current delivery
program and therefore omitted from the Contractor's scope of works as presented in the attached

drawings. However,the Contractor is to enhance the pedestrian crossing at the signal and provide a
passive provision to construct the entrance at a later date.

The provisions of Engineer's Instruction No.87 referenced above are therefore deleted within Volume 5:

Lot 2.2, Al Sadd Station, enhancements of the pedestrian crossing at Al Quds signal, subject to MOTCLTPD

in the format described under 13.2.1and 13.2.2 Sub Clauses of the General Conditions of Contract for
the Engineer to take into considerat ion when proceeding with the determination under Sub clause
