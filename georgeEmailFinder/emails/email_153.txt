Subject:Notice To Correct
Dear Sir,
We write further to our previous several correspondences including, but not limited to those referenced
above, and with reference to your Letter of Award (LOA) for “Supply & Installation of Roller Shutter
Doors Work Package Works” dated 20 July 2014 reference (1) above.
Despite our previous numerous reminders and Notice to Correct letters Ref.
MTB/TCA/TECHTRADE/L/000035 dated 10 October 2015 and MTB/TCA/TECHTRADE/L/000069 dated 14
December 2016, you have not improved your work performance and have not provided sufficient
support to the project. At the time of writing this letter, you have failed your Contractual Obligations to
manage your works which consequently puts the Project’s Milestones at risk.
In view of the above you are informed that the situation has become harmful to the Contractor’s
obligations under the Contract. Consequently, a potential Claim against you pursuant but not limited to
Clause 16.6 [Delay Damages] is now becoming more evident, if you do not take all appropriate measures
to rectify your failures immediately.
Therefore, in an effort to resolve this matter at once, we hereby instruct you pursuant to Clauses 11.3
[Instructions of the Contractor] and 22.1 [Notice to Correct] to proceed immediately and take action for
the following issues:

1.
Email Subject: Non Compliance with Contractual obligations. Non delivery of material (Sunday,
March 11, 2018 1:34 PM)
We have made numerous requests to you via emails and phone, to get a delivery schedule for all the
remaining materials and the order acknowledgements from the factories, but none of our requests have
been complied.
If you do not provide the required information the soonest, we will need to take appropriate action and
visit your supplier’s factory to verify whether the materials are in fabrication or not. Consequently, in
the event that you are unable to provide the required information, we will place a QC monitor at your
factories to ensure that the products are in fabrication and meet the Project Requirements. Please note
that any and all costs related to the abovementioned will be charged to you pursuant to Clause 10.3
[Contractor's Claims].

(MTB/TCA/TECHTRADE/L/000110 dated 15 Feb 2018)
We have issued the letter referenced above, urgently requesting you to fill out the form and supporting
documents for ADCD as mentioned in the letter, but no reply has been received to date.

and 1st May 2018, respectively. You were then informed about the compulsory attendance for the

our main office. Your failure to attend the meetings as requested and take appropriate action has been
noted in this matter.

provide your target program to completion; in which you failed to reply within 7 days upon receipt of
the letter on 9th December 2017, as required thereunder.

We hereby inform you that if action is not taken as stated above, you will be in breach of the
Subcontract provisions in accordance with but not limited to Clause 8 [Subcontractor’s Obligations] due
to the delay of the foregoing. You are further informed that we will no longer tolerate your conduct in
respect of this matter which may cause delays to the Subcontract Works for which you shall be held
solely responsible.
In view of the above, we hereby give you a Notice to Correct under the Subcontract Clause 22.1 [Notice
to Correct] to proceed with all required contractual submission and expedite the Subcontract Works
immediately. At this juncture, we must emphasize once more that any delays, costs, losses and/or
expenses and the like incurred by us and/or Other Sub-Contractors arising as a result of your failure to
complete the aforementioned activities will be solely your responsibility pursuant but not limited to
Clauses 10.3 [Contractor’s Claims], 12.12 [Other Contractors and Other Subcontractors] and 16.6.1
[Delay Damages].
Finally, this Notice to Correct requires your response within seven (7) days of receipt of this letter.
