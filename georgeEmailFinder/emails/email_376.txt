Subject:Engineer’s Instruction No. 773A – Bulletin 259.1 – Pier 4 Soil Rectification Works for the Sewage
Network

Dear Sir,
We write with reference to the captioned matter and your letters ref: (1) and (2) above.
On 12 June 2019, we received Engineer’s Instruction (EI) No. 773 appended to your letter ref: (1),
instructing us pursuant to Clause 11.3 (Instructions of the Engineer) of the Conditions of Contract and
Clause 5 (Subsidence) of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (SAA8), “to implement
Bulletin No. 259 with immediate effect, as detailed in the enclosed scope in Attachment A (2 pages).”
Also attached was a CD, containing a total of fifteen (15) IFC Drawings, consisting of two (2) revised IFC
Drawings and thirteen (13) new IFC Drawings. Your covering letter ref: (1) and the accompanying
Employer’s Design Consultant’s Transmittal No: KPF-PD-2132-TRS-1011 dated 20 May 2019, identifies
Bulletin 259 as being associated with ‘Soil Rectification Works for the Pier 4 Sewage Network.’
According to the Change Register attached to EI No. 773 (Bulletin 259), the ‘Reason for Change’ is given
as ‘updated to suit …’ and ‘VR 328’ [not seen by us], while the ‘Description of Change’ refers to amongst
other things, ‘Coordinates of Grout Points’ and ‘Detailed Layout of Grout Points.’
However, circa two weeks later, on 27 June 2019, you then issued EI No. 773A under letter ref: (2),
instructing us also pursuant to Clause 11.3 of the Conditions of Contract and Clause 5 of SAA8 “to
implement Bulletin No. 259.1 with immediate effect …” Again, your cover letter and the attached KPF
Transmittal shows Bulletin 259.1 relating to ‘Soil Rectification Works for the Pier 4 Sewage Network.’
Attached to EI No. 773A (Bulletin 259.1) was a further CD, but on this occasion it contained a total of
eleven (11) IFC Drawings; one of which was simply re-issued from Bulletin 259 and remained at Rev. 0
[despite now being associated with Bulletin 259.1]; one was a completely new IFC Drawings; while the
remaining nine (9) IFC Drawings were revised (Rev. 01) from the earlier versions of Bulletin 259.
It is for this reason that we write to you – as the revised drawings show additional grouting much of
which we believe to be outside the zone of influence of the sewer and therefore unrelated to the sewer
rectification works. This represents additional works for which a valid Engineer’s Instruction (EI) [issued
pursuant to Clause 20.1.1(a) of the General Conditions of Contract] and a Variation Order (VO) are
required.
Using two of the drawings attached to EI No. 773A (Bulletin 259.1) as a basis, we hereby provide an
indication of some but not all of the extent of the additional grouting required as part of Pier 4 Soil
Rectification Works. The following marked-up extracts of Drawing No MTC C 05 AS_L0.0 6.00_.736 Rev.
01 (for S-2303 and S-2304 braches) and Drawing No MTC C 05 AS_L0.0 6.00_.738 Rev. 01 (for S-2301 and
S2301A branches) reproduced in Figure 1 and Figure 2 below respectively, refers.
Figure 1 – Indicative Example of Extent of Additional Grouting to Pier 4:
Extract from Drawing No MTC C 05 AS_L0.0 6.00_.736 Rev. 01
Figure 2 – Indicative Example of Extent of Additional Grouting to Pier 4:
Extract from Drawing No MTC C 05 AS_L0.0 6.00_.738 Rev. 01
Not only is much of the additional grouting works outside the zone of influence of the sewer, and
therefore unrelated to the sewer rectification works, but we also question the requirement for this
grouting in the first place as it appears to be grossly disproportionate to the size and type of pipe,
namely a UPVC pipe of small diameter (63 mm to 100 mm) acting under pressurised (ie not gravity) flow
conditions. We request that you make this known to the Employer and advise him that there will be
significant cost implications which will not be borne by us and likely will not be borne by the insurers
either (assuming: (a) that they admit liability; and (b) that the costs are not excluded by the LEG 2/96
provision in the insurance policy) on the grounds of proportionality and betterment.
The SAA8 laid down mandatory procedures to be followed if additional works are required by the
Employer, and you have failed to follow these. As EI No. 773A is non-compliant with SAA8 we require
you to withdraw it.

In the meanwhile, should the Employer desire this additional grouting to be carried out, we would
expect that he direct you to issue us with an EI requesting us to provide the following:
(i)
a price for the additional works;
(ii)
a fragnet for the additional works; and
(iii)
the integration of the fragnet within Programme Rev 11.2 to demonstrate the effects (if any) on
the Milestones.
Meanwhile, until such time as the necessary actions are taken by you and the Employer in accordance
with SAA8 Clause 2.29, we will not be implementing the additional grouting works.
As regards your reference to Cause 5 (Subsidence) of SAA8, in addition to it not being relevant as the
additional grouting is unrelated to the subsided sewer, we also record that as previously advised in
other correspondence from us (including without limitation, our letters dated 24 February 2019 ref:
MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/013965 and dated 8 April 2019 ref: MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/014206), unless and until a
supplemental agreement is executed between us and the Employer as previously agreed that deals with
the representations made by the Employer to us, Clause 5 has no effect.
Finally, by copy of this letter to the Employer, we suggest that he notify the insurer of his requirement
for this additional grouting as we believe that it may not be covered by the present insurance claim for
the subsided sewer.
Yours faithfully,
