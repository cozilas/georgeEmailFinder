Subject; water ingress during wet weather
Dear Sir
The engineer notes and records the ingress of water into the building duting the adverse weather on
February. Water ingress was recorded at the following locations:
Gatehouse
The contract is requested to submit the root cause for the above water ingress and the amendment
being made to the Contractorâ€™s wet weather plan to prevent reoccurrence.
The Engineer further noted that the adverse weather has the potential to wash sand and debris into the
roof drainage system thus the appropriate measures should be in place in other to avoid such incidents.
The contractor further requested to advise the maintenance being carried out on the roof drainage
system during construction to prevent build up and blockages within the system
Yours faithfully
