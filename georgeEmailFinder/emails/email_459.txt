Subject: Handing back of all PQC Apron and associated areas
Dear Sirs,
We refer to the above-noted Notice of Claim number 9 and to a recent series of meetings and
discussions concerning the state of the MTA Contractor's Pavement Quality Concrete and associated
area surfaces and infrastructure that have been trafficked by us in the course of our Works. It is a
matter of record that significant sections of the apron areas in general, including those not in any
way used by us, require various levels of rectification and remedial work in order to meet ADAC's
specification.
Following detailed inspections carried out with representatives from ADAC, Aecom and the MTA
Contractor we accept the assessment that some damage has probably been caused as a result of our
use of some of these areas. We are therefore prepared to offer the sum of AED 3,000,000 in full and
final settlement of all and any liability and of all current and any future claims against us of any sort
in respect of such damage caused up to the date of this letter, whether or not its existence was known
to any party. All such areas are now confirmed as having been handed back to the MTA Contractor
and are no longer under our control or responsibility.
We request the Employer's confirmation of his acceptance of this offer and that his Notice of Claim
number 9 issued under Contract Clause 10.3 is withdrawn.
Yours faithfully,
