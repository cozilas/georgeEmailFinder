Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer’s Consultation under Sub-clause 3.5.1 of the General Conditions of Contract of
reference 1) for the additional scope of works related to Entrance 3 in National Museum the Contractor
hereby responds to the Engineer’s assessment and requests the following adjustments to it.

Vide the Engineer’s Instruction of reference 2) the Contractor is instructed to proceed with the
execution of all Architectural Finishes Works for the fixed lump sum of QAR 1,029,280,000...

The scope of works related to Architectural Finishes Works for Entrance 3 (excluding design) has been
included in the fixed lump sum price instructed under reference 2). The net amount of QAR
4,984,400.00 excluding 12% mark-up provisioned for the Architectural Finishes Works for Entrance 3 as
per the BoQ enclosed to letter reference 3) is only indicative and cannot be regarded as an isolated
pricing element of the final negotiated fixed lump sum amount. Furthermore the actual scope of works
for the Architectural Finishes Works for Entrance 3 has not changed subsequent to the Engineer’s
Instruction of reference 2).

As part of Engineer’s Consultation of reference 1) the Architectural Front of House Works were priced
based on quantity take-offs from the latest design and rates extracted from the BoQ enclosed to the
Contractor’s letter of reference 3). Said evaluation is part of an accurate evaluation of the total value of
the works as agreed in Schedule 5 of the CASA. This evaluation was never intended to form part of any
adjustment of the Contract Price in relation to the Architectural Finishes Works.

The Contractor therefore requests the Engineer to revise the propose adjustment of the Contract Price
issue of its Consultation of reference 1) according to the following table.

Yours faithfully,
