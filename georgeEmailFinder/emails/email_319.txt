Lobby to Level L.01 at Pier 2 and Pier 3 – Request for EI / VO
Dear Sir
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and/or disruption to the Works and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
Your revised Rev. 01 response to RFI/0401/17227 detailed in Annex A represents a change in design and
scope and requires a valid EI and VO in order for us to integrate the same into the Works.
Potential Impact
Any requirement for additional works at this stage of the Project, such as that outlined herein, is likely to
impact on the achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required

We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within seven (7) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
During BCC inspections held on 28 March 2019 and 14 April 2019, the House of Expertise (HOE) /
Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) raised the following queries / observations regarding the smoke / fire
compartmentation to the ‘Service List Lobby’ and ‘Freight Lift’ to Level L0.1 to Pier 1 and Pier 3:
•
“Service lift lobby 0214 was not smoke compartmented as shown in the fire compartmentation
drawing.”
•
“E-cart stagging [sic] lift Freight lift in Level 0.1, 1.0, 2.0 3.0 and Pax lift in level 2.0 3.0 pier head
area is not smoke compartmented.”
We clarified to HOE/AHJ during the inspection, that the Design of the ‘Service Lift Lobbies’ at Pier 2 and
3 to L0.1 detailed in the IFC Drawings (refer to Figure 1 and 2 below) upon which our approved Shop
Drawings were based, did not provide for any such compartmentation. We further clarified that the
Freight Lift doors are in fact fire rated as per the Design and approved Material Submittals.

IFC ref: MTC A 02 TB L0.1 2.14 00.446 06
Subsequent to which, we raised RFI/0401/17227 Rev. 00 on 13 July 2019, entitled ‘E-cart Lift Lobby Fire
Compartmentation Comment on BBC Inspection’ together with the following attachments:
•
An extract from ZUTEC summarising the purported design / non-compliance issues pertaining to
HOE/AHJ’s comments (i.e. ‘snag’ ID 95147 and ID 100602 (refer to Figure 3 below); and
•
A copy of the approved Material Submittal MS/401/LET/0040-02 dated 23 March 2016, and
accompanying Certificate of Compliance, confirming the fire rating of the Freight Lifts doors.
Within RFI/0401/17227 Rev. 00 we wrote to advise you that: “… since the lift door is fire rated, lobby
compartmentation is not required. Engineer is requested to confirm the same.”

Attached to RFI/0401/17227 Rev. 00
We requested a response to RFI/0401/17227 Rev. 00 by 27 June 2019; however, you failed to reply until
16 calendar days later on 13 July 2019. Nevertheless, the Employer’s Design Consultant (KPF) clarified
that the HOE/AHJ’s comments were “meant to address the smoke compartmentation of the lobby, not
fire compartmentation.” KPF further stated that “… the service lift lobby is not required to be smoke
rated by code, however this is an ADAC/AHJ requirement. ADAC to advise”.
For the avoidance of doubt, both the Employer’s Design Consultant’s comments and the Employer’s
comments detailed in the response to RFI/0401/17227 Rev. 00 are reproduced in Figure 4 as follows:
Figure 4

However, on 30 July 2019, we received ‘additional clarification’ from you by way of a revised (Rev. 01)
response to RFI/0401/17227, where both the Employer’s Design Consultant’s and the Employer’s
comments had been revised. Notably, KPF’s comments which previously advised that “…the service lift
lobby is not required to be smoke rated by code”, were deleted and similarly, ADAC’s comments that

originally suggested that “… Contractor may amend the mistake by either construct the smoke
compartmentation or install smoke curtain at the elevator door…” was replaced by with alternative
wording that states: “Contractor to either construct the smoke compartmentation or install smoke
curtain at the elevator door.” Both sets of revised comments are reproduced in Figure 5 below:
Figure 5
Notwithstanding that any questions as to the fire rating of the elevator door was now deemed to be
“irrelevant”, we nevertheless confirm that we have fulfilled our contractual obligations in so far as both
elevators and the areas which they are compartmented have been constructed in accordance with the
Employer’s Design Consultant’s design; namely the IFC Drawings and Specifications and the fire rating
requirements have been achieved. We further reiterate that the Lifts/Elevators have been approved as
mentioned above by virtue of the Status Code 2 response to MS/401/LET/0040 Rev. 02.
As regards the smoke compartmentation of the Lift Lobbies, we also confirm that these have been
constructed in accordance with approved Shop Drawings which have been based on IFC Drawings
prepared by the Employer’s Design Consultants and issued by you (refer to Figure 6 for example).
Figure 6 – Pier 3 Level 0.1 Sector 3.15
Shop Drawing No: 401-JV-A-05-01-3.13D-BK-SD-001
However, it is patently clear from the revised response to RFI/0401/17227, that you / the Employer’s
Design Consultant / Employer are urging us to provide a new smoke curtain at the elevator door, and as
such, this represents an attempt to introduce change to the existing design and scope of Works.
What is particularly disconcerting, is we are expected to accommodate such a change and at such a late
stage at the Project, but with “no additional time / cost”. This is unacceptable.
We are not the designers for this Project, the Employer’s Design Consultant is. Consequently, we accept
no liability or responsibility for any inconsistencies in the Design [which clearly this is, given that the
HOE/AHJ’s have identified it as such]; this remains with the Employer’s Design Consultant. Our
responsibility is to follow with due diligence the IFC Drawings and Specifications, and it is our position
that we have discharged, and continue to discharge, this obligation with the necessary expertise, care
and skill that could reasonably be expected from an experienced contractor.
In any event, taking into consideration the HOE/AHJ comments stating the ‘Service Lift Lobby’ is not
smoke compartmented, we note that even if a smoke curtain is installed at the elevator door as per the
revised RFI/0401/17227 response, then the smoke compartmentation of the ‘Service Lift Lobby’ will not
be fit for purpose, since the opening towards the corridor remains (Figure 7 refers).
Figure 7
It was for this reason, that a series of workshop meeting and discussions took place involving us, you
and KPF and ADAC between 28 July 2019 and 10 September 2019 in order to resolve the ambiguity in
the design and “to agree on a technical solution for the provision of [smoke] curtain” requested by AHJ
/ HOE and the fact the “issued IFC did not include any smoke curtain … at those locations.”
Moreover, according to both the original and revised response to RFI/0401/17227 the Employer gave us
an option to either construct smoke compartmentation or install a smoke curtain. However, in its e-mail
dated 28 July 2019 [3:54 PM], the Employer’s Design Consultant (KPF) made it abundantly clear that
“after discussing with ADAC-AHJ … [a] … Fire Curtain is required.”
In other words any earlier
requirement for smoke compartmentation fell away, and a smoke curtain was insisted upon.
This e-mail is also significant in so far as it records that “the Fire [smoke] curtain is clashing with MEP
services with no back up information” and requested our assistance with resolving the same.

The ensuing discussions included an e-mail dated 2 September 2019 [1:31 PM] from you in which with
reference to a meeting between the HOJ / ARUP on that same date, it was confirmed that the smoke
curtain was only required to L0.1, and you directed us to provide “the technical proposal for the
provision of smoke curtain … in order to present it to the design consultant for their review …”
We complied, and on 5 September 2019 [5:56 PM] advised you of the following:
“The size of smoke curtain will be app 3000 mm width x 2700 mm height as per site condition at both
Pier 2 and 3 Level 0.1.
The requirements for smoke curtains are one group control panel and 50Hz, 230V, 13Amps, 0.75KW and
Voltage free NC fire alarm signal and BMS interface. Circuiting information should be provided by design
consultant. Secondary Steel Structure will be provided for smoke curtain and gypsum board wall above.
Existing Crush barriers will be modified as per final curtain location.”
The discussions culminated in receipt of two further e-mails from KPF on 9 and 10 September 2019 [5:44
PM / 1:49 PM], in which we were informed that the proposed smoke curtain, approximate size of
3,000mm wide x 2,700mm high, should “fully cover the opening to avoid smoke leaking through the
sides”; while in relation to the circuiting information, we were told the “Contractor shall provide a new
circuit for the smoke curtain from the nearest EM-RP panel fed from a 20A 30mA RCBO. The feeder
cable size shall not be less than 2.5mm2 and shall be sized to compensate for voltage drop.”
Given that the foregoing represents a significant variation to our Works, and in order to seek final
confirmation from you, we then raised RFI/0401/17460 Rev. 00 on 15 September 2019, advising you of
the following:
“… according to IFC drawing MTC-G-04-TB-L0.1-3.51-00.320 [and] MTC-G-04-TBL0.1-2.51-00.318, only
smoke partition required at marked location but in RFI reply 17227, JV was asked to provide smoke
curtain subject to AHJ's comments. We kindly request you to send an El and update the architectural
and electrical IFCs for required smoke curtains.
Referring the attached e-mails … please be informed that there will be a modification at crush barriers,
gypsum wall will be added, to provide the gypsum wall steel structure required.
As noted, attached to RFI/0401/17227 Rev. 00 were:
1.
Copies of the various e-mails exchanged between us, you and KPF and ADAC in the period from
28 July 2019 and 10 September 2019, including those cited above; and
2.
Two marked up extracts of IFC Drawing MTC-G-04-TB-L0.1-3.51-00.320 and MTC-G-04-TBL0.12.51-00.318, showing the location of the two new smoke curtains (refer to Figure 8 and 9).

Figure 9 – Pier 2 Level L0.1 Sector 2.14
MTC-G-04-TBL0.1-2.51-00.318

We requested a response to RFI/0401/17460 on 21 September 2019; however, you failed to respond
until 9 October 2019 but nevertheless were requested therein by the Employer’s Design Consultant to
“provide a coordinated proposal to satisfy IFC and AHJ requirements”. Given the content of its e-mail
dated 28 July 2019 [3:54 PM], cited above in which the Employer’s Design Consultant (KPF) made
expressly said that “after discussing with ADAC-AHJ … [a] … Fire Curtain is required” ADAC-AHJ … [a] …
Fire Curtain is required” then any purported failure on our part to adhere to the original IFC
requirements [in terms of the G-series IFC Drawings], were for all intents superseded by not only the
AHJ’s / KPF’s instance to have a fire curtain [in lieu of the smoke compartmentation] but also the
significant amount of design development culminating in the additional electrical requirements that are
both described above and subsequently confirmed within the response to RFI/0401/17460.

In summary therefore, we write to inform you that the installation of two additional smoke curtains to
the locations indicated and in accordance with the scope and design requested / acknowledged by you,
will, when properly instructed, will result in substantial changes to our original scope of Works. Such
changes will include inter alia the following, involving coordination of numerous subcontractors:
•
Installation of smoke curtains and associated systems;
•
Electromechanical installations;
•
Modifications to crush barriers;
•
Installation of steel structure; and
•
Additional gypsum walls to be added.
SAA8 laid down mandatory procedures to be followed if additional works are required, and you have
failed to follow these; an EI and VO are needed for us to proceed with the aforementioned changes.
We therefore, take this opportunity in also reminding you of the provisions of Clauses 2.29 to 2.31 of
Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’) pertaining to Variations, in so far as we are not to
proceed with any Variation unless a Variation Order and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. In
which respect, it is your obligation to issue this Record first if you wish to instigate change; this is only
after the additional time and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.
Meanwhile, until such time as you take the action required of you in accordance with SAA8 Clause 2.29,
we are unable to proceed with implementing the changes noted above and will continue to proceed in
accordance with the existing IFC design to the extent we are able to.
Yours faithfully,
