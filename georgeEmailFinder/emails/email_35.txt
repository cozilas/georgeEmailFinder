Payment Terms and Conditions

Dear Sir,
With reference to the above subject matter please note that Notes 3 and 4 of Appendix D - Schedule of
Rate and Prices of Schedule 1 [The Services] of the Subcontract Professional Services Agreement state
the following:
Note 3 - “The Sub-Contractor's invoice is submitted upon receiving of the Employer approval on the
edited video files”;
Note 4 – “Payment is due 30 days from the date upon the receipt of the approved invoice”.

Notwithstanding the above and in consideration of the fact that is taking the Employer a long time to
approve the videos, as a gesture of goodwill we shall proceed with the payment of the submitted videos
taking into consideration the following conditions:
1.
The acceptance of the final cut and/or payment of the video does not relieve you from your
duties and obligations under the Subcontract, to acquire the approval of the Employer;
2.
In any case that the Employer requires editing on the final cut of an already paid video, it is your
obligation to do it in a timely manner and without additional cost to us.
Please note that all Terms and Condition of the Subcontract Professional Services Agreement remain the
same.
Yours faithfully,
