Dear Sir,

N/A

This is a direction under Sub-Clause 13.2.1 for the Contractor to submit a quotation and a separate
programme for the variation proposed by the Engineer regarding the adjustment of ticket offices and
retail areas due to a proposed new retailing strategy.

The Variation as proposed:

•

Remove Ticket Offices and add in Customer Information and Gold Services Centre.

•
Use the space of the ticketing office to place the TVMs (Ticket Vending Machines). Each station
should have at least 2 empty cabled slots for additional TVMs if required in the future. TVMs should be
in close proximity to Customer Information and Gold Service Centre. The impact on station layout
should be minimal.
•
Remove the travel centre (except Souq Wakif Station) and use it for retailing or other
requirements. The Contractor shall submit the quotation within 14 days from receipt of this direction.
