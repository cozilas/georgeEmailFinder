Dear Sir,

Refer to the Instruction issued under reference 2), which relates to the Variation of the Employer's
Requirements in respect of provision of a third Underpass Entrance (Option 3a-Optimized) from
National Museum of Qatar (NMQ) to NMQ Station.

Pursuant to Sub-Clauses 3.5.1and 13.6.1, the Engineer will now proceed to agree or determine
adjustment to the Contract Price and the Schedule of Payments resultingfrom this Variation.

With reference to your letter M006-GDB-COM-LTR-05737, dated 21 August 2016,and subsequent to
commercial workshops held between the Contractor and the Engineer's Assistant's team, I propose for
your consideration and agreement of the additionalcost as set out in Appendix A.

There is no impact to Key Interface and Taking Over dates.

In arriving at the proposed additional cost, the following points were among those considered: 1.
Costing is based on the tendered schedule of rates for the provision of NMQ Station.
2. Architectura l finishes and utility relocation design and construction costs have not been included in
this valuation of Variation. These will be valued under the provisional sum
protocol if and when awarded.
Yours faithfully,
