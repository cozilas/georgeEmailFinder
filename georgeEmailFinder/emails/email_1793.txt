Dear Sir,
The Contractor's attention is drawn to the ever increasing number of outstanding quotations, following
the Engineers direction under Volume 3, Sub-Clause 13.2.1 'Proposed Variations', which states:
"The Engineer may direct the Contractor to submit a quotation (both as to price and any possible delay)
for a proposed Variation. The Contractor shall submit the quotation within the time specified in the
direction or, if no time is specified, within 14 days of the direction"

The Engineer's Assistant attaches a non-exhaustive list of outstanding quotations that serves to highlight
the extent of the Contractor's delay in responding to the directions within the contractually specified
period, despite the continual reminders being sent.
The Contractor is reminded that without such quotations the Engineer is unable to make informed
decisions under Volume 3, Sub-Clause 13.2.3, which turn is causing significant delays in the decision
making process under Sub-Clause 13.1 'Rights to Vary' thus leading to delay in the issue of the
corresponding Engineer's Instruction .
The implications of the Contractor's actions is also putting the project at risk of abortive costs and
significant delays to the Time for Completion, through variations being delayed in their issue and/or the
Employer being forced to implement change without understanding the full implications under the
Contract.
This behavior of the Contractor must be remedied immediately through applying adequate resources
and attention to this important process.
Should a\y abortive costs or delay to the Time for Completion arise, directly or indirectly as a result of
the Contracto 's failure to comply with Contractor's obligations under Volume 3, Clause 13 'Variations
and Adjuslme ts', any such impacts will considered attributablelo the Contractor's account.

Yours faithfully,
