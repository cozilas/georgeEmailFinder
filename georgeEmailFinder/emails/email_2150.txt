Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to letter reference 1) and the latest discussions regarding the Engineer's
Assistant's request for a revised quotation and programme for the design and construction of the
amended pedestrian Access and Underpass walkways at Souq Waqif Station.

Further to the Engineer's Assistant's request, the Contractor encloses herewith its revised quotation for
the amended pedestrian Access and Underpass walkways at Souq Waq if Station.

The estimated structural, civil, MEP, architectural finishes and utility relocation design and construction
cost is provided for budgeting purposes only, and it does not include any other additional cost that may
arise as a consequence of a late Instruction, such as the cost of rework or abortive design, especially for
the Souq Waqif current subway configuration and station concourse level. These costs (if any) will be
addressed under separate cover.

Given the limited amount of time and information available at this stage, the programme for the design
and build of the amended pedestrian Access and Underpass walkways will be provided under separate
cover.

We remain at your disposalfor any further information and/or clarification.
Yours faithfully,
