Dear sir
We write in relation to RFVO {1) related to Engineer's Instruction No. 430- De-scope of Beam Seating
Compensation. In the Request for Variation Order, the Contractor claimed that due to the instruction to
de-scope beam seating, considers the omission a breach of Contract and that as a result is entitled to
recovery of costs and profit associated with the omission. The Contractor has calculated the costs that it
considers is entitled based on 11.11% (Overheads and Profit) of the omitted Scope - Beam Seating i.e

AED 22,190,603.75. The RFVO is for the amount of AED 2,465,378.08. The Conditions of Contract are
very explicit with regards to varying works. The definition of Variation in the General Conditions (Clause
1.1) includes; " .... a) the addition, omission or substitution of any work or any part thereof" The
Engineer considers that the omission of the beam seating falls within the definition of Variation and
rejects the Contractor's assertion that issuance of Engineer's Instruction No. 430 constitutes a breach of
Contract.
With regard to the Contractor calculation of the amount due (AED 2,465,378.08 for profit and
overheads}, the Engineer has previously written to the Contractor (letter reference 6102} referring to
Schedule 6- Bills of Quantities (of the Conditions of Contract)- Preamble 12;
"The rates inserted in the Bill of Quantities will be used to value any Variations to the Works, whether
omissions or additions. The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment for profit and overheads on the
value of any omitted Works" Based on the Contractor's submission, RFV0/0401/1408 is rejected and a
Variation Order in the amount requested will not be issued.
Yours faithfully,
