Subject:TCAJV Rectification Works between GHs 36-37
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to your letter (1) and our letter (2).
In accordance with Bulletins 260, 260.1 and 260.2, we have been instructed to rectify the sewer line
network which requires us to enter the area and breakout the PQC works installed by the MTA
Contractor, between Gatehouse 36 and 37 (refer to attached photographs) to carry out our works.
Whilst we will conform to the terms and conditions of No Objection Certificate (NOC) N-505, as
appended to our letter (2), and with specific reference to NOC â€“ Annex, Item 3, we have concerns
regarding the workmanship of the PQC and substructure works installed by the MTA Contractor.
Whereas we undertake to reinstate and return the works in the same/ better condition in which we
received the area [to the satisfaction of the Engineer], we cannot accept liability for any works installed
by others, uncovered by us during our rectification works and found to be as not conforming with the
specification.
Any subsequent re-works to non-conforming works previously installed by others, will require a formal
instruction from the Engineer and compensation in accordance with the provisions of the Contract.
We will maintain and share with you, photographic records of the rectification works throughout the
duration, including a pre-commencement photographic condition survey.
We look forward to your prompt release of the above NOC so as not to delay the planned progress of
our rectification works.
Yours faithfully,
