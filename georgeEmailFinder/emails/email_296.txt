Subject: Prolongation cost submission
Dear All Subcontractors,
In line with TCA-JV’s recent letter dated 11th May 2017, which you should now have received
concerning Subcontractor’s Prolongation Costs, please be advised you are hereby requested once again
and reminded to provide the cost substantiation files relating to those time periods as stipulated in that
letter, those being the cost months for post HoA periods from March 2015 to April 2017 (or the most
recent ‘actual cost’ month available).
Please consider once again the format, contents and structure of prolongation cost files which you were
advised of, and which you have submitted to the JV previously for the HoA period up to March 2015,
which is now required to be submitted in the same fashion, for cost months March 2015 to April 2017.
Below are the 4 attachments (once again) for guidance and formats on the prolongation costs to be
provided, which you should now be fully conversed with.

Subcontract Costs - Guidelines - May 2017.docx >>
As mentioned in our letter of 11th May 2017, please note that this email is not, of itself, to be
considered as an admission of any entitlement to extension of time and/or additional payment, nor
does it constitute a waiver of any of the terms of the Subcontract.
Please advise by return to those cc’d above and myself when you are able to submit prolongation cost
substantiation files, and for what periods?
Your immediate response is expected and appreciated.
Kind Regards,
