Subject: Continuous Violation to HVAC Protection Plan; Stored and Installed Mechanical
Materials/ Equipment at Site Contaminated with Urine and Human Waste
Dear Sir,
The Main Contractor reiterated the above concerns about the above subject to which it appears proper
requirements were being totally neglected by the Sub Contractor on his daily routine for Mechanical
Package Delivery at site. Continuous violation/ negligence to HVAC Protection Plan Requirements even
lead to misuse of stored and installed materials/ equipment at site as urinals and/or toilet. Traces of
urine
and human waste were evident on mechanical materials/ equipment. This is totally unacceptable and
immediate strict adherence to the approved HVAC Protection Plan must be implemented aside from the
Static and Dynamic Equipment Maintenance requirements. Also the Sub Contractor is reminded to
revisit
his declared Preventive Measures in closing CMA NCR-702 related to equipment protection against
using
it as toilet, AHU in particular.
Subject concerns have been relayed to your side in official and unofficial platforms but inattention to
addressing it has been observed. This leads to another NCR issuance from CMA aside from the many
outstanding Site MEMOs, TCAJV issued NCRs and Site Discrepancy Reports. See attachments. You are
strictly instructed to mobilize your resources in addressing concerns recorded on those Notification
Defects not to be a reason of delays on T&C activities and area handover.
Yours faithfully,
