Subject: Water Spillage in CP Level 2.0 Zone 07
Dear Sir,
With the reference to the aforementioned subject matter detailed within your letter ref. no
"MMM/17/MTB/0220" dated 18 October 2017, kindly note that our stance remains the same as
indicated in our letter "MTB/TCA/MOSART/L/000431" dated 17 July 2017.
Furthermore, in accordance with the Subcontract Agreement Clause 24.2 (Subcontractor's Care of the
Subcontract Works}, it is disappointing to confirm that you have ignored your responsibilities by
disregarding to take care of whole of Subcontract Works until it shall pass to Contractor. All Subcontract

Works must be protected at all times therefore your responsibility of protection of Subcontract Works is
valid until you receive a Taking Over Certificate issued by Contractor. If any loss or damage occurs to
Subcontract Works during the period when Subcontractor is responsible for their care of the Work, you
shall rectify the loss or damage at your risk and cost. Therefore, your statement in your referenced letter
"Mosart will not be held responsible to the undesirable consequences or damages that may arise in the
future affecting the installed flooring at the subject area" is invalid and not accepted by our side. At this
juncture, we would reiterate our concerns regarding your inadequate protection capability of the Work.
In the view of above, you are hereby instructed to immediately take necessary precautions to protect to
Work and additionally we remind you of your obligations to corroborate your compliance with Schedule
0 - Scope of Works of the Subcontract Agreement, Sub-Clause 4.3.19 "to take full responsibility t o
protect its work (including free issue items) and to take all necessary precautions to avoid damage when
working adjacent to other works."
Yours Faithfully,
