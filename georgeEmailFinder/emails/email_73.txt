Subject: Flood Damage in Basement Levels LB1 and LB2
Dear Sir,
We refer to your letter (1) and respond as follows using the same nomenclature:
1. Whilst it is noted that the Contractor has identified possible sources of the root causes, it is
therefore evident that the Contractor was aware that such risks existed and had failed to
implement the requisite precautionary measures to prevent or at least mitigate the risk of
such occurrence. We note that the Contractor failed to update and implement the inclement
weather plans and preparations respectively ahead of the storm predictions despite several
reminders from the Engineer to protect the works against such risk. We therefore disagree
with the Contractor's statement that the Contractor ' ... not having found any cause of our
making'. The Engineer maintains its position that the Contractor is fully responsible for the
damage to their Works and has failed to protect their Works as required under Clause 24.2.2
of the Conditions of Contract.
2. The Engineer's position is as noted in item 1 above and as documented via correspondence
(2), (4), (5) and (6).
3. The Engineer is not obliged to review the Contractor's repo rt. The Engineer's Observation
Report was issued via correspondence (4) to assist the Contractor in identifying the various
shortfalls which led to the flooding of the MTB's LB1, LB2 and at the external areas so that the
Contract or would address these immediately as to prevent further reoccurrences in the event
of similar inclement weather occurring. We note that to date the Contractor is yet to address
the observations which were made by the Engineer via (5) and 6) and continues to fail in
adequately protecting their Works in accordance with the Contract .
4. Gross Negligence is defined in the Contract as follows ' Gross Negligence means any act or
failure (whether sole, contributory, joint or concurrent) which seriously and substantially
deviates from a reasonable course of action without justification and which is in reckless

disregard of, or indifference to, foreseeable harmful consequences'. The alleged insufficiency in
a site-wide storm water disposal provision in no way constitutes an act of Gross Negligence on
the part of the Employer. It is therefore reasonable to note that had the Contractor known of
that the flooding of the MTB LB1 and LB2 areas were the foreseeable harmful consequences,
then the Contractor has been negligent to put in place measures to cater for the foreseeable
event and comply with their obligations under the Conditions of Contract.
5. Our response to item 4 above refers.
In relation to the last paragraph of your letter (1), we also believe that the Project needs to move
forward in the urgent rectification of the flood damage and request the Contractor gives immediate
focus to complying with their contractual obligations and bringing the damaged works into full
compliance with their contractual requirements. The Contractor's linking of the insurance process to
the replacement/rectification of the damaged works dismisses the Contractor's obligations under the
Contract to proceed immediately with the replacement, rectification of the affected works and to
mitigate against further delays to the completion of the Project.
The Engineer reserves the Employer's rights pursuant t.o Clause 10.3 of the Conditions of Contract for
all delays associated with the above.
Yours faithfully,
