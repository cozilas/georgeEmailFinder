Subject Request for Confirmation of Variation Order Pursuant to COC Sub-Clause 20.1.4 (b) for
RFI/0401/15178- Pavilion Wash Rooms- Wash Basin
Cross Ref. (1) MTB/TCA/AECOM/l/012157 dated 28 December 2017
Dear Sir,
You will be aware that the washroom design was amended as part of Briefing Pack 13 and for which
workshops were held for each washroom. The Contractor issued sketches for each workshop
incorporating comments provided by the Design Consultant and following sign-off these became the
Neutral Documents on which the shop drawings were based.
We find that the shop drawings of partition layouts to all the identified washrooms required the
Contractor to coordinate partition setting out with BP13 and resubmit, however no resubmittal has
been
received and site works were undertaken by the Contractor at his risk.
As stated in your letter (1) above the Contractor proposed through RFI-15178 to install smaller wash
basins to overcome the problem of doors touching the basin when open and this solution was accepted

by the Engineer so as not to disrupt site progress. We confirm that no Variation Order is required as this
change to wash basin size would not have been necessary if the Contractor had undertaken the required
coordination and resubmitted the shop drawings accordingly.
Also, it should be noted that the setting out of washroom doors to a number of pavilion washrooms (20P18, P19, P24, P25, P26 & P43) was amended under RFI/0401/ 7454 to prevent the doors clashing with
the wash basins.
Yours faithfully
