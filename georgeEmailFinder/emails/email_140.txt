Subject:Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic – Request for Immediate Guidance
Dear Sirs,
We refer to the rapidly developing situation regarding the epidemic levels of the Coronavirus (COVID-19)
that has fast become a pandemic affecting numerous countries around the World including the UAE.
We the TCA JV are doing our utmost to try to cope with the epidemic particularly in terms of the impact
on this Project, and now have an Infection Control Plan firmly in place. That said however we – and
more specifically our labour force – continue to work in an environment that is entirely contrary to what
is laid down in guidelines laid down by the UAE Authorities; in other words, the majority of our labour
force i.e. circa 8,000 labour (including subcontractors) are frequently working in confined spaces and
therefore unable to maintain what is now touted to be a ‘social distance’ from one another. We fear
that in the event that a handful of labour on this Project is unfortunate enough to contract the
Coronavirus (COVID-19) disease and then they return to their individual labour camps, then this could
potentially expose something in the region of 150,000 labour to the effects of the Coronavirus (COVID19) disease.
We full appreciate this is an unprecedented situation and completely fluid in so far as it is changing daily
but we seek your further and immediate guidance as to how to minimise the risk on this Project.
Yours faithfully,
