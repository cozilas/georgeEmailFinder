Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to letters referenced 1 and 2 above, replies in the same order as the points were
raised in the initial letter;
•
Please provide clarification as to the Employers requirements for the additional Customer
Information and Gold Services Centre to enable the Contractor to provide a cost and time impact.
•
Please provide further information regarding the ticket vending machines (which the Contractor
believes will be rear accessed) and are being designed by MSI, to facilitate providing a quotation for
these works. Specifically the Contractor would need to know the quantity of ticket vending machines to

be installed, the spacing requirements for these machines by station, who will be responsible for cable
containment for the power and data cables, and any requirements for maintenance areas. The
13.2.1 request for quotation only details the requirement for at least 2 empty cabled slots for additional
TVMs if required in the future which is not sufficient information for the Contractor to price.
•
Please provide clarification as to the Employers requirements for the "retailing or other
requirements" that would be introduced in lieu of the Travel Centers to enable the Contractor to
provide a cost and time impact.
Yours faithfully,
