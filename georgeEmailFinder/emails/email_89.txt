Dear Sir,
Further to our letters referenced in (3) & (4), kindly find enclosed another letter received from M/s. SITA
referenced in (5), which is self-explanatory.
Further to our review on the contents of the above letter, we regret to inform you that we believe your
site
Personnel have damaged the display screen while fixing the perforated sheet in between the display
screen and signage. Please note that your employees have repeatedly committed the same mistakes on
different occasions regardless of our previous notifications to put in place precautionary measures to
avoid repeating such negligence.
We hereby request you to provide a comprehensive explanation to enable our assessment of the same.
Failing such, we shall hold you responsible and back charge all the reinstatement cost and other
associated cost from your account according to the Conditions of Subcontract Agreement Clause 10.3
(Contractor's Claims) and Clause 12.12 (Other Contractors and Other Subcontractors) whereby you are
liable for the loss and damages arising out of your action.
Whilst writing, you are hereby advised to implement strict preventive measures in order to avoid such
incidents in future.
This is for your information and necessary action.
Yours faithfully,
