Subject:SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0091
Delays to the processing of Re-Entry Permit / NOCs and Activities of Others Affecting Finalisation of MEP
Works and the C&E Integration to Level L2.0
Dear Sir
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described herein
may cause delay and disruption to the Works, and accordingly seek your swift resolution of the same.
The Event(s):
In the period between 30 April 2019 and 12 May 2019, we submitted a series of Re-Entry Permits /
NOCs, requesting permission to re-enter various Duty Free and F&B Outlets to Level L2.0 to allow us to
complete various MEP Works, including without limitation, wire pulling and the checking of wiring.
These Permits or NOCs include the various RDD Form 15s set out and summarised in Table 1 below:

RDD-094
Rev. 01 RU-2001 – Rooms L20-2644 & L20-2645 & L20-2626 & L20.0186 12-May-19
3 days NOC has not been issued at present
The information recorded in Table 1 shows the date the request for an NOC was made, the duration of
works contemplated, the date the NOC was received [if applicable], the date work commenced [if
applicable the period worked [if applicable], and our corresponding remarks or comments.
This shows that in relation to RDD Nos. 075 and 094, we have been prevented from working in the
manner intended and in respect of RDD No. 094 Rev. 01 we have still not received approval [NOC].
Details of the various Permit Requests for Re-Entry [RDD Form 15] issued between 30 April 2019 and 12
May 2019 and accompanying e-mails [if applicable] are included at Annex A hereto.
The purpose of this E-notice is two-fold: Firstly, we wish to notify you of appreciable concerns we have
in relation to the NOC process, specifically a failure on your part to process our requests for re-entry
promptly and issue the approved NOC is an timely manner, and Secondly the invariable impact that this
failure has on our ability to complete the FDB [JV – what does this mean?], energization and
commencing the C&E integration; and accordingly urge you to ensure that the responsible third-party
(DEPA) engineers respond to the requested NOC issuance in prompt and timely manner.
That said, our concern is not just limited to obtaining NOC approval but also working time considering
that the Employer’s Other Contractor leaves site in the afternoon due to Ramadan timings and
accordingly we are prevented from working inside the area during the afternoon and evening.
Potential Impact:
Acts of prevention such as these will at this stage of the Works, prevent us from obtaining the Building
Completion Certificate (BCC). This is critical is us achieving completion of Milestone MS09B.
Consequently, the more we are prevented from working due to the combined effects of the above, the
more likely this will prevent us from achieving Substantial Completion (i.e. Milestone MS09C).
Action Required:
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works;
specifically, we urge you assist with the prompt processing of our Re-Entry Permits allowing us access as
well as urging the Employer’s Other Contractor to work with us so as not to delay our Works. Kindly
ensure that such matters are resolved within ten (10) days from the date of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
Yours faithfully,
