Dear Sir,

Reference is made to the Engineer’s letter item 1) regarding the use of steel fibre reinforcement in the
tunnel segments and the requirement to provide time and cost benefits to the employer.

The Contractor states that use of steel fibre is in full compliance with the Employer’s Requirements.
Clause 13.3.3.9 of volume 7 clearly states the following:

“If steel fibre reinforcement is used for segmental lining it shall comply with EN 14889 and have a
minimum tensile strength of 1100 N/mm2.”

The same interpretation of the Employer’s Requirements was taken at the time of tender. In Volume 11
– Contractor Technical Proposal, Section 6 Supplementary submission clause 1.1, the specification
states:

“Tunnel Lining Concrete and reinforcement”

•

Steel fibre (to EN14889-1, tensile strength 1100MPa)

The Contractor has therefore withdrawn the RFC, reference item 2) above and terminated the workflow
in Aconex, see below:

The Contractor has clearly fulfilled its obligation to comply with the Employer’s Requirements hence
there are no time and costs benefits applicable to this issue.

Yours faithfully,
