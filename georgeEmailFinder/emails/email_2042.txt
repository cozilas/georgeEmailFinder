Dear Sir,

The Contractor’s writes further to its proposal of reference 1) and to the recent discussions held with
the Engineer’s Assistant on the subject whereby it was requested to provide a number of documents
related to the actual costs that it has incurred in relation to the reduced traffic diversion works at Sport
City Station.

The EA has further requested the Contractor to provide formally the proof that it incurs withholding tax
on its Subcontracts with Petrucco.

The requested back-up in relation to payment of withholding tax is therefore enclosed in attachment 1)
to this letter.

The Subcontracts with Petrucco are provided in attachment 2) to this letter.

A calculation of the expected total withholding tax is included in attachment 3) to this letter.

The EA is therefore kindly requested to include the withholding tax in its assessment.

Further requested back-up which was already provided informally will be formally resubmitted within 7
days.

The Contractor also notes that it does hereby not intend to recover any cost over and above the cap
agreed under the CASA.

Yours faithfully,
