Dear AB JV,
This is to put on record that we have collected from your office today, the Cheque No. 2189Dt.14.09.20-ADCB for the amount of AED 407,881.97.
Please note that an amount of AED 1,535,452.82 (AED 1,943,334.79 - 407,881.97) is still pending for
payment, for the two payments of IPA4 & IPA 5 as shown in our email below. It is worth noting that both

payments are long overdue and are critically delayed for more than 48 days and 15 days respectively, as
of today.
Consequently, this is to inform you that the amount received today is not sufficient to cover our costs
and/or expenses, which have accumulated in the last few months, due to your failure to proceed with
our payments on time, as per the Payment Terms Clause 6.3 of the Letter of Award (LOA) ref:
AE03C1/B10CZ/00/00 dated 15 January 2019.
In view of the above, we request you to proceed with the release of the remaining amount of AED
1,535,452.82 immediately, in the form of a cheque or at the minimum with an on-account payment.
Moreover, please be informed that today Thursday 17 September 2020, we have started pulling-out
workers and personnel from the site as discussed in our email below, as a measure of minimizing our
exposure to further financial risks caused by AB JV's actions. The reduction of manpower will continue to
be implemented on our part, until receipt of the full overdue payments.
Your failure to proceed with our payments on time is alarming and we hold you fully responsible for all
negative consequences arising out of this.
This is for your information and immediate action.
Yours faithfully,
