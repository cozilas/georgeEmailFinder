Dear Sir,

The Engineer's Assistant (EA) refers to letter at reference 1) above, wherein the Contractor was
instructed to initiate and execute a variation under Sub-Clause 13.1.1 of the General Conditions of
Contract.

EA notes that the Contractor has not submitted to date any Variation quotation as a result of the
Engineer's Instruction No. 96, but has provided quantum for varied/additional works associated with the
same subject under Claim Number 43 , referenced 2).

In light of the above, EA would like to reiterate that for varied works the Contractor should use the
contractual mechanism provided by Clause 13.

In addition, the Engineer shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of Sub-Clause 13.6.1"Valuation
of Variation", where this letter serves to offer the Contractor an opportunity to consult with the
Engineer to
agree '\ value of Variation prior to issuing a notice under S l

e 3.5 "Determinations".

Yours faithfully,
