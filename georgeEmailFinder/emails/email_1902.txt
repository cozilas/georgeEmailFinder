Dear Sir,

In response to letter references 1) and 2) the Contractor hereby confirms that save for items 64 and 148
of attachment 1) which consist of the VRF Unitsâ€™ alternative vendors and the UPS / Battery Room
ventilation requirements, all other optimization items listed in Appendix F of EI 138 have been
incorporated into the MEP design.

Yours faithfully,
