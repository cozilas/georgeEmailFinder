Subject:External teams in ADAC organization
Dear Sir
We have recently noticed at various meetings between us (i.e. Principal, Risk Management, on-site
meetings, etc.), the attendance of what appear to be, ADAC’s external representatives, to whom we
have not been previously introduced to and whose role has not been shared with us. Moreover, we
have also been requested to share information about the Project with the abovementioned ADAC’s
representatives, without any prior formal written confirmation by an authorised person from ADAC
and/or Aecom.
Such actions are not acceptable and do not meet the established lines of communication and protocols
of the Project and certainly must be avoided in the future.
We therefore kindly request you to officially notify, identify and confirm the presence of any of the
stakeholders assigned in the Project by you / ADAC and/or any of ADAC’s external representatives,
which would participate and/or attend to any meeting and/or any exchange of information associated
with the MTB Project.
We trust you find the aforementioned self-explanatory and clarifies the matter.
Yours faithfully,
