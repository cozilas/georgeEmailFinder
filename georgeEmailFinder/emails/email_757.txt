Subject:Re: Site Instruction for Temporary Works
Dear Sir,
With reference to the above subject and in continuation to your letter referenced (1) above, please note
that there will be no instruction issued for the works mentioned in your letter.
This is due to the fact that the works were a result of your culpable events which caused delays in the
project. Specifically, the temporary works mentioned in your letter are due to your failure to coordinate
with the other trades as per your Subcontract obligations, which resulted to consequent delays.
The above is also in connection with your subcontractorâ€™s M/S Assa Abloy failure to complete the
permanent works as per the programme. In the event that your subcontractor had completed the works
as per the programme, the temporary works you are claiming for, would not have been required.

This is for your information and records.
Yours faithfully,
