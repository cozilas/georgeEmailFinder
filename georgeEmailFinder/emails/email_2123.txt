Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to letter 1) whereby the Engineer issued Engineer's Instruction No. 86 pursuant to
Sub- Clause 13.1.1, initiating a variation which amended Volume 5 - Employer's Requirements Particular, Sub- Clause 2.2.7 [Al Adhawaa Station I Switchbox M20/M21] of the Contract, which includes
the addition of the following new Sub-Clause 2.2.7.4:

"Lot 2.2 Bin Mahmoud station, entrance 1.2 (Refer to attached SAP drawing CP0_14_74061 Rev V6_ 0)
shall allow for a soft panel to enable a 6.Bm wide underpass and to extend past the entrance to the
corner of Qatari Bin Al Fujaah Sreet and to Al Khaleej Road in accordance with drawing no.
CP0_14_74061, Rev V6_0.

•
Contractor shall design and fix the reinforcement in the station walls through which additional
entrances may pass so that part of the wall can be safely removed without losing structural reliability.
•
The design of the rooms, columns, MEP services and architectural finishes shall take into
account the position of future entrance locations so that the passenger flow through these future
entrances is not obstructed. "

The Contractor notes that the SAP drawing attached to the Engineer's Instruction No. 86 is not the latest
revision, as discussed with the CPO and subsequently issued to the Contractor by the Employer under
reference 2), namely SAP drawing CP0_14_74061 Rev V7_0 (enclosed herewith for ease of reference).

Further to the above, the Contractor gives notice pursuant to Sub-Clause 13.1.2 (ii) and (iii) of the
General Conditions of Contract, requesting the Engineer to provide the necessary clarification with

regards to the SAP drawing revision (CP0_ 14_74061 Rev V6_0 or CP0_ 14_74061 Rev V7_O) that
encapsulates the final SAP requirements.

For the record, the implementation of the SAP requirements for Bin Mahmoud Station is currently
progressing in accordance with drawing CP0_14_74061 Rev V7_0, as already stated under Contractor's
letter reference M006-GDB-ENG-LTR-00337 dated 07 September 2015.

Accord ingly, upon receiving this notice, the Engineer is kindly requested to cancel, confirm or vary the
instruction.
Yours faithfully,
