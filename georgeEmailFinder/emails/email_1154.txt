Subject: Schedule of OHP% & Manpower Supply Rates for Back Charge Account
Dear Sir,
In line with our support to all the Subcontractors who may require our assistance for supplying of
labours, materials, plants, tools, equipment or any facilities in connection with their respective Scope of
Works, please be informed the Over Head and Profit (OHP) % and Manpower Supply Rates shall be
applicable as shown in the enclosed schedule.
In addition, please be advised in the event that we have carried out the works on your behalf due to
your failure to perform any part of your Scope of Works, the above OHP% shall be deemed applicable
and the same will be incorporated in your back charge account accordingly. Please note the
aforementioned OHP% and rates shall be adjusted without prior notice as and when deemed necessary.
We hope the above clarifies the situation.
Yours faithfully,
