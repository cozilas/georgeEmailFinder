Subject:Clause 27.1.1: Notice of Claim – Delay Notice No. 265 [post-SAA8]
Radioactive Isotope Sources for Walkthrough Metal Detectors and RadSeekers
Dear Sir
We refer to our Site Acceptance Test Procedures – RadSeeker, submitted vide the Document Submittals
referenced at (1) to (3) above, as well as our letter ref: (4) and request you to provide us the Radioactive
Isotope Sources for the Walkthrough Metal Detector and RadSeeker SAT (Site Acceptance Test)
activities.
Federal Authority for Nuclear Regulations (FANR) restricts the provision and usage of such equipment
(radiation sources). Nevertheless, during the FAT conducted on 20 October 2016 in MTB Wing F Test
Lab; Employer has provided two of the required radiation sources; Caesium 137 and Californium 252.
Similarly, the same is required for the SAT activities for the Passenger Baggage Screening Systems (PBSS)
equipment. The request has already been communicated to the Employer and the Engineer through
HBSS/PBSS weekly progress meetings, and included in the approved Site Acceptance Test Procedure –
RadSeeker per DS/0401/13644 Rev. 00 (ref: 3) as well as our letter ref: (4). However, we are unable to
get a confirmed date for the delivery of the following requisite Radioactive Isotope Sources.
•
Caesium 137 (Cs-137)
•
Californium 252 (Cf-252)
•
Europium 152 (Eu-152) needs
•
Barium 133 (Ba-133)
•
Cobalt 57 (Co-57)
Absent these sources we are unable to complete the commissioning of the 4 RadSeekers and 44 WTMDs
(Walk Through Metal Detectors) due to the unavailability of the Radioactive Isotope Sources.
We therefore require your immediate attention to this matter.
Meanwhile, the failure to be provided a confirmed date for the delivery of the above Radioactive
Isotope Sources constitutes an acts of prevention and/or breaches of Contract on the part of the
Employer and / or the Employer’s Personnel and / or the Consultants, and as such we accordingly give
you notice, pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1, of our right to claim:
(i)
An extension to the Time for Completion pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c); and

(ii)
An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.1 pursuant to Clause 9.10, or,
in the alternative, damages for breach of contract.
Interim and/or final details of the Time Impacts and adjustments to the Contract Price relating to this
event will be provided in due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.5(a), (b) and (c).
Although the genesis of this ‘event’ originated prior the ‘Effective Date’ included in SAA8 (4 September
2018), this cannot possibly be construed as forming part of the ‘Included Circumstances’ (per Clause
1.7.4 of SAA8) and will be included within any forthcoming Time Impact Analysis, albeit in recognition of
the Effective Date included in SAA8, any delays will be analysed from 4 September 2018 onwards. SAA8
cannot reasonably be interpreted as requiring the Contractor to absorb delays of unknown (possibly
unlimited) duration occurring pre/post 4 September 2018, particularly where the resolution of the
matter causing the delay lies with the Employer. We contend therefore that under the circumstances
the responsibility, under the Contract (as amended by SAA8), for such delays lies with the Employer.
Yours faithfully,
