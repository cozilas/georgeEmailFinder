Re: Design Liability for Internal Glazing Calculations

Dear Sir,
We refer to the above correspondence and your letter referenced (2) where you requested us to
provide evidence required to demonstrate that M/S Al Ghurair (AGC-A) has complied with the
Specification requirements of the internal glazing, particularly relating to design calculations.
We therefore put on record that this issue has been discussed between the Engineer and the Contractor
during the meeting on Wednesday 12th December 2018. We hereby confirm that all information will be
provided with due diligence and as per Contract Clauses 9.7.2 [General Design Obligations], 12.1.1,
12.1.2, 12.1.6(h, i) and 12.1.7 [The Contractor's General Obligations].
This is for your information and records.
Yours faithfully,
