Subject:Clause 27.1.5(a): Interim Particulars of the Basis of Claim
Delay Notice No. 1127 – Delays to the Passenger Boarding Bridge Installation and
Cladding of the Gatehouses and Fixed Link Bridges due to Employer’s Other Contractor (L&T)
Dear Sir,
Further to Delay Notice No. 1127 (letter ref: 3), the Contractor hereby submits fully detailed interim
supporting particulars of the basis of claim in accordance with Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause
27.1.5(a).
1.0
Basis of Claim
Background
1.1
According to Conditions of Contract (CC) Clause 12.12 (‘Other Contractors’) and in particular,
Sub-Clause 12.12.1, the Contractor agrees that its access to the Site of the Works is not exclusive and
that Other Contractors may perform work on the Site concurrently with the Works.
1.2
Accordingly CC-12.12.2, places a contractual obligation upon the Contractor to ensure that it
shall:
“(a)
cooperate with the Other Contractors to ensure the coordination of the work of the Other
Contractors with the execution of the Works including timeframes, programmes and schedules for
completion of the Works;
(b)
take such actions as are necessary to facilitate the works of Other Contractor, including
providing Other Contractors with access to all essential services and amenities and any places where
work is being carried out or materials are being prepared and stored; and
(c)
Take such actions as are necessary not to delay or disrupt any Other Contractor.
1.3
On this basis therefore, it is reasonable to assume the Employer has placed reciprocal
contractual obligations upon its MTA Contractor to cooperate with the MTB Contractor and take such
actions as are necessary to facilitate the works of the MTB Contractor, including providing the MTB
Contractor with access to any places where work is being carried out; and to coordinate its works so as
not to obstruct, disrupt or delay work being performed by the MTB Contractor.
1.4
In the event however, the MTB Contractor’s PBB and cladding installation works continue to be
impacted, as a result of L&T’s failure to complete its works in a timely manner.
1.5
It is this that represents the basis of claim outlined below.
Chronology of Delays
Background
1.6
In addition to the cladding works of the MTB and Piers, the Roofing Works subcontractor
‘Chadwick’ was required to install the external cladding to all Gatehouses and Fixed Link Bridges.
However, prior to doing so, the Passenger Boarding Bridges had to be installed by ThyssenKrupp, which
required access to the areas where the Employer’s Other Contractor (i.e. ‘L&T’) were undertaking
ground works. All such dates were contained within the Rev. 10.4 Programme. In respect of the issues
contained within this submission, the Contractor reproduces the associated Activities for Gatehouses 3,
4, 19, 20 and 21 in Tables 1.1 to 1.10 hereunder:

Based on the foregoing, access should have been provided to ThyssenKrupp between 8 August
2018 and 1 September 2018, which would then allow Chadwick to commence external cladding works
with completion between 17 September 2018 and 16 December 2018.
1.8
However, as a result of L&T’s delayed works, these dates could not be achieved.
Chadwick Letter ref: 733
1.9
As a result of the delays caused by the Employer’s Other Contractor (L&T); on 5 September
2018, the Contractor received letter ref: 1 from Chadwick. Therein, it was recorded that the five

aforementioned Gatehouses (i.e. 3, 4, 19, 20 and 21) were “without passenger boarding bridge (PBB)
due to restricted access and unsuitable ground conditions…”.
1.10 In substantiating the foregoing, Chadwick attached the following five photographs for each of
the affected Gatehouses, clearly evidencing the unsuitable ground conditions, thereby restricting access
for ThyssenKrupp and Chadwick:
Figure 1.1 – Gatehouse 3
Figure 1.2 – Gatehouse 4
Figure 1.3 – Gatehouse 19
Figure 1.4 – Gatehouse 20
Figure 1.5 – Gatehouse 21
1.11 Furthermore, Chadwick expressed “major concern” as the duration of the Contractor’s works
following access from L&T was 3.5 to 4 months.
1.11.1 Chadwick’s concern is clearly justified when compared with the Rev. 10.4 Programme dates
provided in Tables 1.1 to 1.10.
Chadwick Letter ref: 736
1.12 The Contractor received further correspondence from Chadwick on September 2018 (letter ref:
2), which made reference to planned works for GH 19, 20 and 21, based on full L&T access dates, as
follows:
1.12.1 GH 19 and 21 by the end of August; and
1.12.2 GH 20 by the end of September.
1.13 However, despite these proposed access dates, Chadwick advised that access to GH19 remained
unavailable, whilst only partial access was permitted at GH21.
1.14 Based upon which, Chadwick notified that the failure to provide access will delay the Works.
1.15 Therefore, the Engineer is urged to instruct L&T to complete its works forthwith and therefore
allow access to both ThyssenKrupp and Chadwick to complete the PBB and cladding works in order to
mitigate the ongoing delays.
1.16 It is because of the disruption and delays being caused to the Contractor’s works that the
Contractor was compelled to raise Delay Notice No. 1127 (letter ref: 2) on the basis that the MTA
Contractor (L&T) has an obligation to take such action as is necessary to facilitate the works of the
Contractor. As noted above, this includes inter alia completing the ground works to allow the
Contractor to undertake Passenger Boarding Bridge installation and external cladding; and to coordinate
its works so as not to obstruct, disrupt or delay work being performed by the Contractor.
Impact of Delay
1.17 The outstanding works noted above for which the MTA Contractor is responsible, has impacted
and is for all intents continuing to impact on the Contractor’s ability to commence and therefore
complete the following:
1.17.1 Installation of Passenger Boarding Bridges; and
1.17.2 External cladding of the Gatehouses and Fixed Link Bridges.
1.18 The Engineer is therefore urged to forthwith instruct the Employer’s Other [MTA] Contractor
(L&T) to complete its works without further undue delay.
These Interim Particulars
1.19 At the date of preparing these Interim Particulars (which is 30 September 2018, the Contractor
records that it has still not been afforded access to undertake its works in the affected areas. The effects

of delay have yet to be fully realised at present, and hence the various events and circumstances giving
rise to this claim outlined above, are having a continuing effect on the Time for Completion.
Summary
1.20 The Contractor undertakes to review the event(s) and circumstances described herein, in order
to assess the direct and consequential effects on the Time for Completion of the Works; the outcome of
which will be submitted in due course, pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.2.1.
2.0
Date Basis of Claim is Discovered
2.1
The Contractor considers that the date the basis of claim was discovered is 5 September 2018,
which represents the date at which the Contractor received letter ref: 1 advising of the delays, and when
it became apparent that the various events outlined above, was delaying the Contractor’s works and
give rise to an entitlement to an extension to the Time for Completion, and associated additional Costs.
3.0
Relevant Contract Provisions
3.1
The Contractor’s entitlement to an extension to the date for Completion of Milestones
(principally Milestones 9 and 10, and any associated additional and/or abortive costs arises from:
3.1.1 a breach of the Contract or act of prevention on the part of the Employer, the Employer’s
Personnel, the Consultants or the Other Contractors pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.1 (c); and
3.1.2 Contractor’s Claims pursuant to Sub-Clause 27.1.
3.2
The impact that this delaying event will have on the Clause 16.3 Programme (Rev. 6.2) will be
determined by a Time Impact Analysis (TIA) pursuant to Conditions of Contract Clause 27.2.1.
3.3
In the meantime, further interim and / or final details of this claim will be provided in
accordance with Sub-Clauses 27.1.5(b) and Sub-Clause 27.1.5(c).
Yours faithfully,
