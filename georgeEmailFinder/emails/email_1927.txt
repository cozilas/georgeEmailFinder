Dear Sir,

Further to the receipt of letter reference 2) and the memo reference M000-QRC-MEP-IOM-00068
referenced therein, the Contractor notes that he has not been instructed by the Engineer to implement
the memo nor has it been provided otherwise by the Engineer’s Assistant. The Contractor is therefore
unaware of any contractual obligation to adhere to aforementioned memo and thus cannot confirm its
agreement with the same.

The Systems Contractor has provided revised ICD of reference M010-MSI-INM-13-ICD-10357 Draft rev.
1.4 vide letter reference 2) which incorporates the changes issue of aforementioned memo. Without
any admission as to the Contractor’s obligation to adhere to aforementioned memo, the Contractor has
reviewed the changes proposed by the Systems Contractor in ICD reference M010-MSI-INM-13-ICD10357 Draft rev. 1.4 and encloses its comments thereto in attachment 1) to this letter.

In line with the current progress of the BACS Subcontractor it is critical that no late changes to the BACS
design are imposed through the interface process. The Contractor therefore kindly requests the Systems
Contractor to implement the Contractor’s comments enclosed in attachment 1) into the ICD reference
M010-MSI-INM-13-ICD-10357 Draft rev. 1.4.

Furthermore the Contractor notes that the full particulars regarding the M006 physical and systems
(diagnostic) I/O lists, which the Systems Contractor requested under reference 2) have been provided to
the Systems Contractor on 12 June 2017, as per reference 1) and the signed receipt enclosed in
attachment 2) to this letter.

Finally the Contractor notes that based on the information provided under reference 1) it is now the
Systems Contractor’s obligation to prepare the respective M006 interface I/O list and incorporate these
references into appendix B to ICD ref. M010-MSI-INM-13-ICD-10357 Draft rev. 1.4. The Systems
Contractor is kindly requested to provide these I/O interface points’ documents, including interface info
with respect to IEC-60870-5-104 points addresses, within 28 days as any further delay will impact the
BACS Subcontractor’s execution program.

Yours faithfully,
