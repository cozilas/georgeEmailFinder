Dear Sir,

Subject to ongoing discussions with the Engineer and the Engineer’s Assistant, the Contractor was
informally instructed to exclude the following element of the Engineer’s Instruction reference 1) from its
Scope of Works:

Volume 5, Sub-Clause 3.5.14
Lot 2.2, AI Sadd Station, enhancements of the pedestrian crossing at AI Quds signal, subject to MOTCLTPD review and approval, are to be provided as well as a passive provision to construct, at a later stage,
the South-Eastern entrance of the Station.

The Contractor kindly requests the Engineer formalize the above and to issue a revised Instruction
accordingly.

Yours faithfully,
