Subject: Amicable settlement period termination and not ice under 12.10.1
Dear Sir,
We refer to your letter 2080 dated 18 March 2019 within which you have set out a number of
unsubstantiated allegations seemingly based largely upon conjecture and selective recall. As a
result you have postulated an unbalanced interpretation of the actuality. We however, are content
to rely upon recorded data that when presented for objective review will reveal the facts in this
matter.
It is an indisputable fact that since early October 2018 till the end of February 2019 we have
engaged with you in a series of detailed workshops and meetings in an endeavour to explain to
you the basis and rationale behind our assessment of your claims, as well as attempting to guide
you on the requirements for substantiating these claims to the requisite level. In support of this
statement we attach a schedule which details these workshops and meetings.
Notwithstanding the considerable efforts made by us in these workshops and meetings, in many
instances you appeared either not to understand, or blatantly refused to accept, our requirements
for addressing specific matters. When you appointed your external consultants Procom in
February 2019 we were genuinely hopeful that finally some progress might be made. Regrettably,
and rather curiously, not long after having appointed Procom you have proceeded to terminate
the amicable settlement process. We now await your further advice and/or action as to how you
wish to proceed and trust you will understand that we are similarly considering all our options.
Meanwhile, and in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding signed between us,

please confirm as a matter of urgency your intended recovery actions in respect of your various
failures to deliver materials and to meet the schedule of works and completion dates set out in
Appendix 3 to that Memorandum.
Yours faithfully,
