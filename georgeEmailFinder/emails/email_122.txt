Subject Notice of Proceeding with the Works for the MATV as per IFC Drawings
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence (1) wherein the Contractor informed that it considers the
received Code 3 for its Shop Drawing ref. 401-AN-E-01-GE-0.00-SL-SD-089 to be unfair and that it will

proceed as per the IFC Drawings instead of addressing the comments and resubmitting the Drawing.
We would remind the Contractor that the maximum distance limitation of 2000 meters mentioned in
the shop drawing is factually incorrect and the same has been confirmed by your supplier. We also note
from your supplier's letter that the distance of the Fiber pulled between the LNB ref 2353 and the OP/RF
Converter Quattro ref. 237002 cannot exceed the 4000 Meters distance (see enclosed email
correspondence and supplier's letter).
It is evident that the Contractor's submitted shop drawing was based on incorrect assumptions which
necessitated unwarranted multiple workshops with the Engineer and the Employer to seek an alternate
solution.
We note the Contractor's comment that it will proceed as per the IFC Drawings, however we note that
the provided Code 3 was justifiable given the miscalculations by the Contractor.
Yours faithfully,
