Subject Clause 27.1.5 (b)- Further Interim Particulars
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence {1) regarding the submission of Interim Particulars and Time
Impact Analyses {TIAs).
The Contractor attempted to justify its noncompliance by referring to part of Clause 27.1.9 without
demonstrating its compliance with the entirely Clause 27.1.9. We reiterate the full wording of Clause
27 .1.9 "The requirements of this clause 27.1 are in addition to those of any other provision of the
Contract which may apply to a claim. If the Contractor fails to comply with this or another such provision
in relation to any claim, any extension of the Time for Completion, reimbursement of additional Cost
and/or adjustment to the Contract Price shall take account of the extent (if any) to which the failure has
prevented or prejudiced proper investigation of the claim, unless the claim is excluded under clause
27.1.2"
We reiterate again that it is the Contractor's obligation to adhere to the Contractual process in respect
to the submitted claims and we once again record that the Contractor has failed to submit the required
TIAs {27.2 Conditions of Contract).

We record that the Contractor in correspondence (1) has not evidenced the impact of the alleged delay
to its programme and furthermore has not stated the implemented mitigation measures for the
