Delay Notice …… - DU and Etisalat Containment Installation works

Dear Sir,
On 26th January 2019, the Contractor received letter reference (1), from the IT – SCS Works Package
Subcontractor ('BOND'), notifying the Contractor about the "Delays in the DU and Etisalat Containment
installation works due to the non-availability of coordinated shopdrawings, which are required to be
provided by the Employer’s contractor M/S GSM".
BOND’s scope of work for the above is limited to the installation activities, while the scope for BIM
coordination and shopdrawings development is with GSM. Consequently, BOND stated that it
completed some of its works following the available shopdrawings where possible. However, the
previously issued shopdrawings by GSM have resulted to numerous clashes.
Following the above stated clashes and the failure to provide the mentioned shopdrawings by GSM,
have resulted in the works being on-hold.
Accordingly, it is the Contractor's contention that such pending actions and failures constitute a breach
of the Contract or an act of prevention on the part of the Employer.
In view of this, the Contractor contends that the foregoing constitutes a breach of Contract and/or an
act of prevention on the part of the Employer’s Personnel and / or Consultants. Therefore, in
accordance with Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which pursuant to SAA8 SubClause 1.1 have not been amended by SAA8], the Contractor hereby notifies the Engineer of its
entitlement to claim:
(i)
An extension of the Time for Completion of the Works pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c); and
(ii)
An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.2 pursuant to Clause 9.10, or,
in the alternative, damages for breach of Contract.
Interim and / or final details of the Time impacts and adjustment to the Contract Price, will be provided
in due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.5(a), (b) and (c).
Yours faithfully,
