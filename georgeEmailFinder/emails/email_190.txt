Subject: Clause 27.1.1: Notice of Claim Delay Notice No. 1002- Engineer's Instruction No. 725
Dear Sir
The Contractor acknowledges receipt on 11 February 2018 of Engineer's Instruction No. 725 ('EI No.
725')
under letter ref: 2, instructing the Contractor to implement Bulletin 247 in relation to the 'Lift Directory
Schedule', in accordance with the information appended thereto.
A preliminary review of El No. 725 indicates that this Instruction will have direct impact on the
completion
and installation of all Lift Directory Signs, plus associated works. Therefore, El No. 725 will potentially
impact on the Contractor's ability to achieve inter alia Milestones MS9A.6, MS08A, MS08B, MS09A.1,
MS09A.2, MS09A.3, MS09A.4, MS09A.5, MS09A.6, MS09A.7, and Milestones MS09B and MS10.
Furthermore, prior to the receipt of El No. 725, the Contractor received El No. 586 on 8 August 2016
(letter ref: 1) instructing to place the Lift Directory Signage Content on hold. Thus, the Contractor hereto
requests the Engineer to confirm if El No. 725 releases the works originally placed on hold by El No. 586.
Therefore, in accordance with Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 16.5.2 and 27 .1.1, the Contractor
hereby
notifies the Engineer of its entitlement to claim:
(i) An extension of the Time for Completion of the Works pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.1(a)
'Variation'; and
(ii) An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.2 pursuant to Sub-Clause 20.3
'Variation Procedure'.
Interim and I or final details of the Time impacts and adjustment to the Contract Price, will be provided
in
due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.5(a), (b) and (c).
Yours faithfully,
