Dear Sir,
With reference to the above subject matter, please note, the fire proofing requirement within Front
Facade

sequence, coverage of fire proofing to ensure compliance with fire strategy report as well as the
authority requirements.

amount shall be deducted from your payment upon receipt of the repair/application cost from the
relevant Subcontractor.

This is for your information and future reference.
