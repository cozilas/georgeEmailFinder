Dear Sir,

We refer to your letters reference 1) an 2) whereby you have instructed us to put on hold all design
related to Al Rayyan Station and tunnel sections Al Rayyan to Doha Zoo and Al Rayyan to Muaither the
reason being that the station may be required to be relocated due to Ashghal Right of Way (RoW).

We confirm that we have complied with your instruction and suspended the design development on the
station as of 02 July 2015 and the tunnels as of the 21 July 2015. The DD1 design progress status of the
station at the time of suspension was 60%. Ground investigation works for the tunnels which had
commenced has also been placed on hold as of 21 July 2015.

However, it is our duty to inform you that this suspension might have an impact on the STKID.DE date,
scheduled for 31 August 2016. The long stop date for the lifting of the suspension is 31 August 2015. Re
commencement of the design work on 01 September 2015 will lead to completion of the design by 31
August 2016. However, this is possible only under the following conditions:

1.
There will be no changes in the Station configuration and the design will continue from the point
when work was suspended;
2.
All design stages will be subject to one review cycle only. The design review cycle includes 21
days review for DVE, 7 days for the incorporation of DVE comments, 3 days for DVE certification and 28
days review for PMC. For Architectural Branding the review cycle includes 21 days per stage (7 days
review for DVE and 14 days review for PMC).

In evidence of the above we enclose herewith for your assessment a detailed programme showing the
logic sequence of all the related design review stages up to 31 August 2016.

Although not critical at this time the tunnel designs are scheduled to commence on the following dates
in order to prevent any delays to the programme.
•

Al Rayyan to Doha Zoo – early start 29 August 2015 and latest start of 29 October 2015

•

Al Rayyan to Muaither – early start 29 September 2015 and latest star of 30 November 2015

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.

Yours faithfully,
