Subject:Re: Submission of Fabrication Drawings
Dear Sir,
We are in receipt of your letter referenced (1) above, wherein you alleged that you are not to be held
responsible or liable for any damages that may be incurred due to the use of your fabrication drawings,
by us or other Subcontractors.
In view of the above, you are hereby informed about your Subcontract obligations pursuant to Clause
9.7.2 [General Design Obligations] that states “Where the Specification requires the Subcontractor to
design work which must achieve specified performance levels, notwithstanding whether the
Specification states or the Contractor provides any criteria, drawings or other information regarding
such design, the Subcontractor shall be solely responsible for the design and to ensure that such design
is sufficient so that the work is capable of achieving the specified performance levels”.
Furthermore, the Subcontract clarifies as per Clause 9.9.4 [Care and Supply of Documents] that “If the
Subcontractor becomes aware of an error or defect of a technical nature in a document which was
prepared for use in executing the Subcontract Works, the Subcontractor shall promptly give notice to
the Contractor of such error or defect”.
In addition, Clause 9.12.6 [Contractor's Use of Subcontractor's Documents] of the Subcontract specifies
that “The Subcontractor shall indemnify and keep indemnified the Contractor against all and any losses,
damages, expenses or costs sustained by the Contractor arising out of or in connection with:
(b) any copying, use or communication of the Specification, Drawings or other documents made by (or
on behalf of) the Contractor, except as allowed under clause 9.13 (Subcontractor’s Use of Contractor’s
Documents)”.
Moreover, according to your Subcontract obligations and as per Clause 12.1.1 [The Subcontractor’s
General Obligations] “[…] The parts of the Subcontract Works that the Subcontractor designs must,
when the Subcontract Works are completed:
(a) be fit for the purpose for which they are intended as specified in the Subcontract; and
(b) be free from any defects in design, workmanship, or materials”.

In light of the above, you are kindly requested to comply with your Subcontract obligations, perform
your duties with due diligence and appropriately coordinate with the Contractor and other
Subcontractors to complete the works as required, pursuant to the Subcontract Clauses mentioned
above and Clauses 12.11 [Cooperation] and 12.12 [Other Contractors and Other Subcontractors].
This is for your information and further necessary action.
Yours faithfully,
