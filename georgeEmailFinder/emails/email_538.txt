Dear Sir,
1} Payment Certificate No 65
2) Contractor's Letter ref. MTB/TCA/ AECOM/ L/ 009302 dated OS November 2016
3} Contractor's Letter ref MTB/ TCA/ AECOM/ L/ 011117 dated 27 July 2017
4} Engineer's Letter ref MTC-CMA-TCA-0401-LTR-07936 dated 08 August 2017
Appendix H to Payment Certificate No 65
We write in regard to Appendix H to Payment Certificate No 65 which lists AED 20,720,304.34 in money
withheld in the May 2017 payment certificate as a result of the Contractor's alleged "non-completion of
NCR's". This withholding is without any justification and contrary to the Contract and Law.
First, the Engineer's deduction was procedurally improper. Before issuing a deduction, the Engineer was
required by Clauses 10.3 and 11.4 of the Conditions of Contract and, by extension, Paragraph 5.3 of
Schedule 11 (Payment Terms), to "consult with each Party in an endeavor to reach agreement." In clear
violation of this, the Engineer issued Appendix H without first consulting with the Contractor. Had it
properly consulted the Contractor, the Engineer would not have made many of the mistakes that it did.
Because the Engineer defaulted in its contractual obligation, it was improper for the Engineer to
withhold
any monies. It is disingenuous for the Engineer to withhold money for some NCRs as a result of the
Contractor's alleged hyper-technical Contractual violations and yet, at the same t ime, disregard the
Contract by failing to follow the contractual procedures for withholding monies.
Second, the Engineer improperly deducted ·AED 7,191,000 for NCRs issued after the period covered by
Payment Certificate No 65. (Attachment 1.) Paragraph 5.2 of Schedule 11 temporally limits the scope of
what may be included within an interim payment certificate to works done "up to the end of the month
for which the Statement is submitted." These works were not deemed defective at the time of the
payment certificate and the Contractor, being notified of them after the fact, had no opportunity to
provide its view regarding the alleged defects. Therefore, such amounts should not have been withheld
for the May 2017 payment certificate.

Third, the Engineer has failed to particularize or otherwise meaningfully assess the amounts that it has
withheld for NCRs 482 and 813.
• NCR 482: The Engineer issued an NCR regarding a stamp that the Contractor put on shop
drawings disclaiming design responsibility for the works. This was because the design had
been developed through Briefing Pack workshops and no detailed IFCs had been issued.
(2) The Contractor protested in November 2016. Having not received a response for
over 8 months, in July 2017, the Contractor again requested that the NCR be withdrawn.
(3) The Engineer only responded to the Contractor's requests by letter dated 8 August
2017 saying that NCR 482 was "technically valid." (4) We have been informed that the
Engineer believes that the NCR should have been closed and has advised ADAC
accordingly. The Engineer then assessed AED 1,500,000 against the Contractor's May
2017 payment certificate.
The Engineer's conduct, especially is delay in responding, is clearly unreasonable. Its
decision to withhold monies for a time period covered by its delayed response is plainly in
error. Even more, the Engineer's failure to particularize and substantiate the amount
withheld is egregious. Damages for any contractual breach must be based on some
reasonable estimate of the Employer's injuries. Punitive damages are not permitted by
law.1 Despite this, the Engineer has not even attempted to justify the amount withheld
rendering the withholding purely punitive. This constitutes a breach of Contract and UAE
law. As such, the withholding of AED 1,500,000 clearly not technically valid.
• NCR 810: Involves the withholding of AED 5,000,000 for alleged deficiencies with the
Contractor's submitted monthly programs. The Contractor has separately written
regarding this issue. Again, the Engineer has failed to even attempt to calculate any
reasonable damages. Its assessment is arbitrary and punitive and therefore unlawful.
Fourth, thirteen NCRs accounting for AED 3,315,000 relate to works for which the Contractor has
remediated and is awaiting the Engineer's final sign-off. (Attachment 2.) The Contractor cannot be
penalized through the withholding of monies due to the Engineer's failure to timely close NCRs.
Fifth, the Engineer wrongfully deducted AED 386,000 for 4 NCRs (NCRs 716, 705, 728, and 782) that
have
already been closed by the Engineer and clearly cannot serve as grounds to withhold monies.
Sixth, the Engineer deducted AED 15,000 for a disputed NRC (718) for which the Contractor has
requested
a "fair determination" that the Engineer has not issued. It is clear from the text and structure of
Paragraph 5.3 and Clause 11.4 that the issuance of a determination is a condition precedent to
withholding monies. Under any standard the Engineer has not rendered a determination.
Paragraph 5.2 requires that the Engineer "act[] reasonably." It clearly did not do that here. The Engineer
is
expected to withdraw Appendix H and, after following the proper procedure, and remedying the
deficiencies identified above, reissue whatever particularized withholdings as may be justified. We
remind
the Engineer of the Contractor's cash flow issues. The Engineer is thus put on notice that the Employer is
liable for all consequences of its improper negative impact on the Contractor's cash flow and for interest
charges on all improperly withheld monies.
Yours faithfully,
