Inspection Following Ceiling Fall Incident

Dear Sir,
Kindly find enclosed the Engineer’s letter referenced (1) above which is self-explanatory. Specifically, the
Engineer’s letter is regarding an incident on site where a previously installed ceiling panel became
dislodged and fell at level 1 of the CP area. For clarity and for the purpose of interpretation, “the
Contractor” in the Engineer’s letter shall be read as “the Subcontractor”.
In light of the above, you are instructed pursuant to Clause 11.3 [Instructions of the Contractor] to
immediately take appropriate action and submit all required information and comply with the
Engineer’s request accordingly.
You are hereby advised to implement strict preventive measures in order to avoid such incidents in the
future. Accordingly, any delays, costs, losses and/or expenses and the like incurred by us and/or Other
Sub-Contractors arising as a result of the aforementioned issue, will be solely your responsibility
including but not limited to Clauses 10.3 [Contractor’s Claims] and 12.12 [Other Contractors and Other
Subcontractors] and shall be deducted/backcharged from your interim payments accordingly
You are therefore required to reply with all the information requested within 3 working days upon
receipt of this letter. This is for your utmost attention and immediate action.

Yours faithfully,
