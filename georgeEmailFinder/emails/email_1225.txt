Subject: Descope of Lozenges
Dear Sir,
With reference to the above subject and in continuation to our letter referenced (3) and your letter
referenced (4) above, find below our response for the matter subject.
Please note that, your statements in your letter referenced (4) above are in fact incorrect and show your
deliberate misinterpretation and denial of your own commitments. We refer to the Commercial Meeting
held at our Office on Thursday 09 November 2017 and in particular to your apparent refusal to proceed,
without the issuance of a revised Variation Order, with the additional works that we have instructed you
to implement, by way of Variation Order No 16.
For ease of reference, we present herewith, the history of events associated with the foregoing, in an
attempt to resolve this matter at once:

Variation Order 16 has been issued to Cloisall on 19th March 2017 for the “Lighting Lozenges
subsequent to the benchmark approval at L0.0” of 173 No Lozenges amounting AED
6,837,389.85;
On 24th July 2017 you have accepted the Variation order via letter referenced (5) above stating
that in case there is a cost variance in fabric requirement, Cloisall may request a revised
Variation;
TCAJV and the Employer requested you to follow the original IFC fabric requirements. However,
you have suggested and insisted on the change of fabric. The suggestion for the change was
acknowledged in several meetings with the participation of the Employer, where it was agreed
that there will be no cost and time impact;
Following the agreement that there will be no cost-time impact on the fabric change, you
submitted a transmittal ref MTB-CLO-TCAJV-T2479 dated 30th October 2017, requesting
additional AED 3,197,094.21 for the change (an increase in the order of approximately 47% over
the amount agreed);
On 19th November 2017, a meeting was held, where you were requested to provide a fully
substantiated cost. Unfortunately no supporting documentation have been provided to date;
Thereafter a reduction in the quantity of the lozenges from 173 No to 10 No was requested by
the Employer;
You have submitted ROM108 Rev02 for the 10 No of lozenges via transmittal referenced (8)
above in which the price was increased significantly from AED 1,037,855.00 to 2,371,215.62
compared to the price agreed in Variation Order 16;
You have failed to provide the substantiation for the increase and refused to proceed on site
without the acceptance of the additional unsubstantiated AED 1,301,246.57. This demonstrates
your intention not to continue performance of your obligations under the Subcontract and
complete the works and as per Clause 22.2.2 [Termination by Contractor for Subcontractor
Default], entitles us to terminate the part of the works affected;
In addition to the above, it is also noted that, during our email correspondence (email sent by
your representative on Sunday, December 10, 2017 5:02 PM) you stated that “The initial price
was grossly underestimated by M/s. SAS and subsequently corrected in the recent submissions

based on the design development process and obtaining related costing based on the
aforementioned…”; It is noted that, even though the statement regarding the alleged
underestimation of the price has no Contractual value, due to the fact that all agreed Variation
Orders are binding under the Subcontract, nevertheless, we requested you to provide all
substantiation for review and evaluation as mentioned herein;
• Thereon, we requested you via official correspondence and several email correspondence to
submit the substantiation of the increase in price, but you failed to do so as per referenced (7)
above;
• Moreover, the lozenge benchmark has already been approved in December 2017 by the
Employer with few minor comments. The final approval has been given by the Employer to you
on 14th January 2018 after rectifications have been completed by you;
• Since the situation became critical, we issued the letter referenced (3) above, omitting the
sections of the mentioned Subcontract Works.
In light of the above explanations, please be informed that the value of the variation will be
implemented as negative AED 6,837,389.85.
The additional cost that you claim associated with the benchmark should be submitted as a separate
RFVO with full substantiation including quotations, invoices, drawings, quantity take off etc. for our
assessment and issuance of separate Variation Order.
You are hereby reminded that any delays, costs, losses and/or expenses and the like incurred by us
and/or Other Subcontractors arising as a result of failure to action Contractor’s Instructions shall be
solely at your responsibility and recoverable from you pursuant to the subcontract agreement clauses
including but not limited to 12.12.4, 16.6.1 and 22.2.4, in addition to other relevant clauses.
Yours faithfully,
