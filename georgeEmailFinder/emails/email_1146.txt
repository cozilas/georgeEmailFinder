Subject Notice of Default - Breach of Subcontract due to Arcade Retail Circulation Area Fit Out
Dear Sir;
Package (MEP) We kindly want to take your attention to the Breach of Subcontract due to Arcade Retail
Circulation Area Fit out Package (MEP). During Site visit we saw that other contractor (Cioisall Co. LLC)
started to work for Electrical Works at subject Retail Circulation Area work (Tenant Work).
In this juncture, we kindly remind you Subcontract Specification Section 013115, 1.5 Work Responsibility
Item C (page 3) in the attachment which clarifies that "to keep continuity within the MTB construction
phase, Tenant Contractors shall use the Contractor's major subcontractors including Electrical
Subcontractor as based on unit rates from BOQ.
This is an entitlement of Subcontractor which is clarified at Subcontract therefore there is a clear breach
of Subcontract by not using Subcontractor for the subject area works.
In the light of above information and attachments, we kindly request compensation of all our costs and
loses as per 21.2.1 (Adjustment to the Subcontract Price) and 27.1 (Subcontractor's Claims). In order to
calculate the total loses and costs due to this breach of Subcontract, we kindly request the total BOQ
quantities of subject area works which shall be done by Subcontractor.
Yours faithfully,
