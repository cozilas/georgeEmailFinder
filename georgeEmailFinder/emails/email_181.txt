Subject: Value Engineering Item Arch-91 Omit Adjustable Top Hats Sections at Main Roof
Dear Sir,
We write to advise the Engineer that Value Engineering Item Arch-91 savings have not been realized.
Please be advised that the IFC Drawings were reissued as originally provided (i.e. by retaining the top
hats). As such the Value Engineer Item savings were not realized as intended.
The Value Engineering Item description states the following;
' .. Omit the adjustable top hat sections at main roof. Rotate the structural metal deck on main roof by
90 degrees and use deeper metal deck section to maintain overall roof build up height. No impact on
form and curvature of roof profile is accepted ... '
Given the minimum radii of 16m (N-S direction) and 448m (E-W direction) and the purlin geometry, it
appears that it was not possible to maintain the original double curvature/warping of the roof. We
therefore conclude that the Employer requires the top hats in order to maintain the original shape of
the roof.
Based on our own investigations, it became abundantly clear that a facetted profile cannot be
overcome by modifications to the supporting structure of the roof. This conclusion is supported by
our specialty Subcontractor M/s Chadwick SEC (LLC) as per the enclosed hereto letter ref. ADIA-NG0039 dated 17 July 2013.
Furthermore, Arch-91 was proposed solely on the basis of omitting the top hats as defined for the
Value Engineering Item. Clearly this was not achievable without reverting to the top hat such than
" ... No impact on form and curvature of the roof profile."
Having reinstated the top hats, we respectfully request that the proposed Value Engineering Item
savings for Arch-91 be returned to the Contractor.
Yours faithfully,
