Subject:Request for Introduction to New ADAC Personnel
Dear Sir
We have noticed at recent meetings between us (including the Principals’ meetings, Risk Management
meetings, on-site meetings, etc.), the attendance of what appear to be ADAC’s external representatives,
to whom we have not been introduced , and whose role has not been shared with us. Moreover, we
have also been requested to share information about the Project with the abovementioned ADAC
representatives without any prior formal written confirmation by an authorised person from ADAC
and/or Aecom.
This does not meet the established lines of communication and protocols of the Project. We therefore
kindly request you to officially notify and identify to us any additional personnel that you wish to
introduce to this Project.
We would also take this opportunity of reminding you of the current requirement for social distancing
and require that any meetings or gatherings of any sort reasonably meet current best practice and UAE
Government advice.
Yours faithfully,
