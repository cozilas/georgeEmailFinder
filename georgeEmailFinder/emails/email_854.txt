Subject Internal Glazing Works Lack of Performance
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to our letter referenced (4) and your Monthly Report No. 67 for the period

ending March 2018 referenced (1), which includes the updated Programme to Completion as of 1 April
2018 and Target Programme Rev 10.4 (Clean-up as of 1 February 2018). The Engineer hereby raises
concerns over the lack of performance of AI Ghurair in the Central Processor, Piers, and all
Gate houses.
One of the main purposes that the Contractor was requested to introduce the Clean-up programme
(01 February 2018) was to align the forecast dates and t o mitigate the impact of delays for certain
trades. The Programme shows slippage to all type of works pertaining to the delivery and construction
(Refer to Attachment-1), such as but not limited to AI Ghurair's scope of works for Glazing (Glass
Screen, Glazing Pavilion, Glass Wall Lining), Toilet Compartment, and Utility Wall, as well as other
activities not included in the programme, such as the Light Box and the Equipment band.
The slow progress of AI Ghurair's scope of work has resulted in a negative impact on the programme,
since the Glass Screen works is on the second critical path for Pier 4. The Engineer raises its concern
that ongoing delays may not be recovered by the next monthly update as previously notified (5).
The Engineer records that, Abu Dhabi Civil Defense No Object Certificate (NOC) is planned to be issued
on 9 August 2018 for Pier 4 and all the work related to AI Ghurair has to be completed prior to the
start of the Civil Defense inspection process. This allows only 3 months from the date of t his letter yet
the relevant material has not yet been delivered to site.
We note that despite the issuance of Notices pursuant t o Clause 12.10.1 of the Conditions of Contract,
the Contractor has not adhered to its commitment that it will manage its Subcontractor as required
under the Contract, and that decisive actions have been taken to rectify its progress (ref.
MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/010779 dated 07 June 2017). Furthermore, we note that Assa Abloy which was
appointed in order to mitigate AI Ghurair's delays is also under performing.
The late delivery of material has negatively impacted the installation works by AI Ghurair (refer to
Attachement-2) and subsequently impacted the succeeding commissioning activities and the target
interim completion dates. The lack of progress has been discussed in the Weekly Progress Meetings
with the Contractor.
Accordingly, the Contractor is hereby requested to submit its Mitigation Plan detailing the measures
proposed to be adopted to mitigate the slippage that has occurred and to eliminate any knock-on
effect on the target completion dates. The Contractor shall include in its mitigation measures the
defective items such as survey, procurement, and installation.
The Mitigation Plan shall be submitted not later than one week from the date of receipt of this letter
and upon agreement with the Engineer, the Contractor shall incorporate the same in the next
programme update.
We remind the Contractor that it is solely responsible for all the delays incurred to date by its
Subcontractor's lack of performance and we hereby reserve the Employer's rights under t he Contract.
Yours faithfully,
