Dear Sir,
The Engineer's Assistant is concerned about the availability of the TBMs on the Gold Line.

Attached are two (2) two tables which summarize the availability of all six (6) TBMs for the months of
June and July 2015. The availability ranges from 26% to 57%. These low values are completely
unacceptable and Contractor is to investigate the causes for these low values and implement proper
actions to increase the availability of all the TBMs.

No TBM has achieved the CMP planned average ring erection rate and the current TBM "availability"
indicates that the achievement of the KITO dates will be jeopardized. The Contractor is to implement
proper remedial measures to ensure that the TBM availability percentage increases and that the
required ring erection rate to achieve the KITO dates are met by all the Gold Line TBMs.

The Contractor shall submit his remedial action plan by COB on 11 August 2015.
Yours faithfully,
