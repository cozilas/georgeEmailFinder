RE: Reply - Store Yard - Unsecured East Airfield Near A TCC

Dear Sir,
We acknowledge receipt of your letter reference (2) wherein you shared your disagreement with the
back-charge notification sent via our letter referenced (1) in respect of the security measures deployed
on your behalf at the store yard.
Your attention is drawn to paragraph 4.2.13 of Schedule 0 [Scope of the Subcontract Works] of the
Subcontract Agreement which states that you shall “provide own security for own working and storage
areas”. In this regard, due to the fact that you are one of the companies benefiting from the use of the
store yard near the ATCC; therefore, the security measures shall be on account of the companies using
the land. We reiterate that you have failed to provide the requisite security at the store yard, hence, we
have provided the security on your behalf, accordingly.
Finally, we confirm that the provisions of Sub-Clause any delasds [Contractor’s Claims] of the Conditions
of Subcontract have been complied with whilst giving reasonable notice to the Subcontractor that
deductions may be applied for the security measures deployed by the Contractor on behalf of the
Subcontractor at the store yard.
We trust the above is clear and consider this matter closed.
Yours faithfully,
