Subject:Engineer’s Instruction No. 580 – Generator Load Bank Connection Confirmation of Variation
Order for Instruction Constituting a Variation
Dear Sir,
Further to the above mentioned subject we wish to respond to your emails received on the 10 October
2018 to amend and resubmit our drawings to reflect what has been instructed under EI 580.
We are not in a position to proceed with the afore mentioned request to amend and resubmit our
drawings until we receive confirmation from the Engineer that this requirement for a Load Bank, already
notified and corresponded through our letter references (1) and (2) above, constitutes a Variation.
As per Sub-Clause 20.1.4 we await your formal written confirmation as to whether the Engineer requires
the Contractor to submit proposals for the implementation of a Variation or intends to issue a formal
Variation Order in respect of Engineer’s Instruction No. 580.
This was never concluded before the Amendment Effective Date of 4 September 2018 and remains a
contentious issue which is not subject to Sub-Clause 1.7.2 and 1.7.4 of the Settlement Agreement and
Amendment Number 8.

Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement and Amendment Number 8 (SAA8) Variations Clauses 2.29, 2.30
and 2.31, notwithstanding the terms of Conditions of Contract Clause 20.3 (Variation Procedure) the
Engineer shall not instruct any Variation after the Amendment Effective Date of 4 September 2018
unless all the requirements of these SAA8 Clauses have been fulfilled in their entirety.
Yours faithfully
