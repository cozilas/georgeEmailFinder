Subject Temporary works related to subsidence rectification works
Cross Ref None
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to ongoing excavations being carried out by the Contractor in order to rectify
the sewer and storm networks.
Many of these excavations are to a depth of up to 9 meters below existing ground levels and are

complex in terms of adjacent ground bearing structures and live utility services (wet and dry) crossing
through the areas requiring excavations. We are very concerned that the Contractor does not have
sufficient temporary works expertise deployed, mainly in terms of site supervision to ensure that the
works are being conducted in compliance with statutory regulations and best practices, considering
the live GSE road, associated surcharge loading and the overall safety of the personnel working within
these deep excavations.
We note that many of the services within the building are energized and have external paths to
earthing and associated earthing pits that may be disrupted during the works. The Contractor must
ensure that such installations are not compromised in any way, and a prior confirmation from your
MEP team is necessary that requisite de-energization (if required) is in place and I or any other
temporary measures to facilitate the same.
To this extent, the Engineer encloses the "Abu Dhabi Occupational Safety and Health System
Framework - Code of Practice" to assist the Contractor in identifying and observing full compliance.
The Contractor is also directed to communicate these requirements to all of its staff, labours,
subcontractors, and to strictly enforce the same.
The Engineer also requests that the Contractor immediately undertakes all necessary and proactive
measures to guarantee compliance with Code, and enhance the safety provisions for their workforce.
We propose to conduct regular site audits with the Contractor to monitor compliance with the
statutory requirements. We will schedule these visits and issue formal invites.
Yours faithfully,
