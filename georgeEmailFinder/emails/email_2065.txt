Dear Sir,

The Engineer's Assistant refers to the above referenced letters, which serve as examples of recent
quotations provided by the Contractor under Clause 13 'Variations and Adjustments'.

The Engineer's Assistant notes that the Contractor's quotation submissions have taken considerably
longer than the time afforded to the Contractor under the Contract and in addition, these quotations
are being submitted with the Contractor reserving its rights to supplement or provide further quotation
at an unspecified time in the future.

This practice is unacceptable, where the Contractor is required to submit quotations that consider the
full implications as to both price and any possible delay under the provisions of Clause 13 'Variations and
Adjustments'.

Where the Contractor has previously provided quotations that the Contractor considers to have not
included the full implications as to both price and any possible delay, the Contractor is directed to revise
and resubmit said quotations within 14 days of receipt of this letter, such that they are complete and
fully inclusive of the entire change or proposed change event.

After the 14 days have expired, the Engineer will proceed under the provision of Sub-clause 13.2.3
'Propose Variations' and or sub-clause 13.6 'Valuation of Variations'.

Yours faithfully,
