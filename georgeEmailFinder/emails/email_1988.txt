Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to the Appendix A to the Engineer's Instruction (E.I.) no.95 regarding changes in
the location of the North-West remote entry at Doha Zoo Station received under letter reference 1).

The Contractor analyzed the Appendix A therewith and ascertained that land acquisition coordinates are
missing from the information provided, therefore an informalrequest was sent (email from Ms.Artemis
Anninou to Mr. James J. Quinlan dated 15 November 2015) to the Engineer's Assistant.

Further to the above, the Contractor hereby kindly requests the Engineer's Assistant to provide the land
acquisition coordinates for the Amendment of Remote Entry at Doha Zoo Station (YWST080). Upon
receipt thereof, the Contractor will proceed with the implementation of E.I no.96 in the design.

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.
Yours faithfully,
