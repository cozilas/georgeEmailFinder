Subject: Delay Notice No. 997 - Delays to 56 nos. of MEP Shop Drawing Submittals
Dear Sir,
submitted on 2 January 2018, due to AECOM Live-Link Workflow Limitations
On 2 January 2018, the Contractor submitted a total of 56 nos. of predominantly Mechanical, Electrical
and Plumbing (MEP) Shop Drawing Submittals, collectively encompassing a total of 129 nos. of Shop
Drawings. The Shop Drawing Submittal schedule included at Annex A hereto refers. However, all 56 nos.
of Shop Drawing Submittals were placed 'on-hold' by the Engineer "due to the Live/ink workflow
limitation[s], and were only stamped received by 11 January 2018" as notified within the Contractor's
subsequent letter to the Engineer dated 15 January 2018 (ref: 2).
Article 1.3 of Specification Section 013300 'Submittal Procedures' governs the processing time by which
the Engineer is contractually obligated to respond to the Contractor's submittals. On the basis that each
of the submittals listed in Annex A are shown to be at Revision 02 or higher, then these ought to have
been responded to by the Engineer 7 calendar days later, i.e. on 9 January 2018. However, Annex A
shows that at the date of preparing this Delay Notice (which is 7 February 2018), the Engineer has
exceeded and continues to exceed the review period for a further resubmittal review expressly
stipulated
at Article 1.3.A.3 (d) of Specification Section 013300, by 29 calendar days. The Contractor contends that
this constitutes a breach of Contract or an act of prevention on the part of the Employer's Personnel.
Therefore, in accordance with Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1, the Contractor
hereby notifies the Engineer of its entitlement to claim:

(i) An extension of the Time for Completion of the Works pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c); and
(ii) An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.2 pursuant to Clause 9.10, or, in
the alternative, damages for breach of Contract.
Interim and I or final details of the Time impacts and adjustment to the Contract Price, will be provided
in
due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.5{a), (b) and (c).
Yours faithfully,
