Persistent Failure to comply with Schedule 14 Insurances

Dear Sir,
We write further to our numerous reminders and comments made to your Insurances vide our letters
referenced above, highlighting your continual failure to comply with the Insurance Provision as defined
in Schedule 14 of the Subcontract.
Please be advised that both your Third Party and Professional Indemnity Policies need to be amended
and resubmitted without any further delay as per our comments made in above letters (3), (5) and (7)
respectively.
Your persistent failure to comply as highlighted above has left us with no option but to withhold your
payments until submission and approval of the said Insurance Policies.
This is for your attention and necessary action.
Yours faithfully,
