Subject:SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0200
BHS – Floor Painting Directional Arrows – Level L1.0 Drive Isles
Receipt of Etihad / ADAC Ops ‘Approved’ Drawings on 8 January 2020 – Request for Issued for
Construction Drawings and Engineer’s Instruction/Variation Order
Dear Sir,
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and / or circumstances described in
Annex A may cause delay and/or disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.

Overview
The floor painting drawing received on 8 January 2020 detailed in Annex A represents a change in design
and scope and requires a valid EI and VO in order for us to integrate the same into the Works.
Potential Impact
Delay and disruption due to the events and circumstances outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
likely to impact on achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required:
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works;
i.e. Issuing such Instruction as necessary for us to instigate the required changes into the Works.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
On 8 January 2020 [10:54 AM], we received a copy e-mail issued by a representative of the Engineer
addressed to the Employer, which for the avoidance of doubt, is worded as follows:
“Is the final layouts for the BHS L1.0 - floor markings been issued to TCA
•
Arrow types, shapes,
•
Colors
•
Dimensions - sizes
•
paint type (e.g. reflective ?)
•
Locations,
Is this all confirmed in the IFC?”
The Employer responded on 8 January 2020 [2:41 PM] providing the following comments:
“We are in the finishing stages, if people don’t keep changing their minds! I have Geraint looking after
this drawing now and once today’s changes are updated and approved by the operational staff, it will be
sent out today.
The only items that’s not shown on the drawing is the Paint Type, I expect this would be covered
somewhere between the CMA and JV…”
Further to which, at 3:43 PM, the Employer provided “approved drawings in .pdf and .dwg format” as
well as “attached a .pdf … for quick reference and a photo the signed version of the drawing.”
A copy of the BHS L1.0 - floor marking layout and setting out drawing approved and signed between the
Employer (ADAC Ops) and the Stakeholder (Etihad) is reproduced in Figure 1.
Figure 1- BHS L1.0 Floor Marking Setting Out
We wish to record that contrary to the Employer’s e-mail dated 8 January 2020 [2:41 PM] however, not
only was the paint type missing from the above drawing, but also the paint colour was not indicated.
Moreover, this was an unreferenced, unnumbered drawing and certainly not an IFC Drawing.
Accordingly, as recorded in our e-mail dated 19 January 2020 addressed to the Employer [12:02 PM] “An
EI is requested since the new drawing of arrows is completely different than the IFC”.
However, in a follow up e-mail also dated 19 January 2020 [3:06 PM], the Engineer informed us that the
issue had already been “clarified” through a combination of letters and responses to a series of RFIs that
pre-dated SAA8 (i.e. 4 September 2018) and thus deemed to be included within SAA8:
“This issue was clarified (in 2016) via CMA letter # 5630 – this in response to TCA letter # 3309 (RFEI0061) – BHS Floor Markings
•
Based on RFI’s – TCA should have produced shop drawings

CMA-TCA-0401-LTR-05630 – Response to RFEI – 0061 Follow RFI’s No. 10039, 10040, 10041,
10042,10043,10049
6 June, 2016
This issue was all included in “Amendment 8” agreement”
For the reasons set out below, this is refuted.
On 3 December 2014 (letter dated 23 November 2014 ref: MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/003309), we wrote in
connection with IFC Drawing No. MTC-B-09-TB-L1.0_0.__-005 Rev. 00 ‘Terminal Building BHS General
Arrangement L1.0 (Apron), informing you of the following:
“There is no IFC drawing that shows the floor marking at BHS Make up areas at L1.0 traffic flows,
designated tug & dolly movement, parking areas etc. If the Engineer intends that this to be provided
please advise of the exact requirements for by issuing revised IFC Documents together with an
accompanying Engineer’s Instruction pursuant to CC-20.1.1(a).”
As this letter served as a formal request for an EI, it was given the reference RFEI/0401/0061.
In the event however, you failed to reply until in excess of one a half years later, on 9 June 2016 (letter
dated 6 June 2016, ref: MTC-CMA-TCA-0401-LTR-05630), attaching the Employer’s Design Consultant’s
[KPF] reply to RFEI/0401/0061, which for the avoidance of any doubt simply stated the following:
“For L1.0 traffic flows and tug &dolly movement Contractor to follow RFI’s – 10039-10040-1004110042-10043-10049 responses.
For parking areas, follow IFC A-02 series.
For floor marking material and specification, Contractor to refer spec 099123 “Interior Painting”
Para 2.1.5
Floor Coating and marking to be white RAL 9016.
Contractor to submit relevant coordinated shop drawings for review accordingly.
Note: This was confirmed by ADAC FM
Technical Clarification.”
We further record that in your covering letter dated 6 June 2016 (ref: MTC-CMA-TCA-0401-LTR-05630),
you advised us that the attached responses to all of the various matters listed therein was considered to
be “clarifications … and therefore no further instructions will be issued …”
In the meantime, on 22 and 25 October 2015, we submitted the various RFIs referenced above (RFI Nos.
10039, 10040, 10041, 10042, 10043 and 10049), seeking clarification of various matters associated with
the Flight Information Display Screens (FIDS) [described below] to enable us to finalise the mounting
installations; which you later responded to on 1 and 7 December 2015 (refer to Table 1 below).

Almost all of the above RFIs were worded in a similar manner. By way of example, with reference to
RFI/0401/10041, we requested without limitation, the following information from you:

“With reference to the attached SAS IFC drawings, Please provide below details to [allow us to] finalise
the mounting installation coordination with other trades
1.
Please advise the L1.0 traffic flows
2.
Please advise the Tug & Dolly movement path way….”
However, in your reply to RFI/0401/10041, and by way of addressing a response to Questions 1 and 2
above, you referred us to two sketches appended thereto (Sketch ASK-2644, 1 of 2 and 2 of 2) for both
the traffic flows and the Tug & Dolly movement path way (refer to Figure 2 and Figure 3 hereunder):
Figure 3 – ASK-2644 (Sheet 1 of 2)
Figure 3 – ASK-2644 (Sheet 1 of 2)
Therefore reverting back to the Employer’s Design Consultant’s [KPF] response to RFEI/0401/0061, the
replies to RFI Nos. 10039, 10040, 10041, 10042, 10043 and 10049, simply provided the “L1.0 traffic
flows and tug &dolly movement”; they did not provide any setting out details, or specific shapes, sizes or
dimensions of the directional arrows to the BHS arrival and departure areas to Level L1.0.
Given the fundamental failure on the part of the Employer’s Design Consultant to provide basic design /
setting out information etc., it was prohibitively difficult for us to prepare detailed shop drawings –
contrary to the Employer stating the “TCA should have produced shop drawings” “based on RFI’s” .
The information was simply not there for us to do so. Even if all of the information was provided in the
RFI responses to enable us to undertake the Level L1.0 BHS area floor painting directional arrows [which
is denied], RFI responses that vary the requirements of the contract / differ from the Contract Drawings,
require IFC Drawings and an accompanying Engineer’s Instruction in order for us to proceed the works.
In the event however, despite us requesting “the exact requirements” (i.e. setting out details, specific
shapes, sizes or dimensions of the directional arrows to the BHS areas to Level L1.0) and “revised IFC
Documents together with an accompanying Engineer’s Instruction” on 3 December 2014 (letter dated
23 November 2014 ref: MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/003309), it was not until in excess of five years later by way
of the Employer’s e-mail dated 8 January 2020 [3:43 PM] that we were finally provided with [signed]
“approved drawings in .pdf and .dwg format” of the BHS L1.0 Floor Marking Setting Out.
Even a cursory review of the approved BHS L1.0 Floor Marking Setting Out Drawing issued on 8 January
2020 when compared with the original IFC Drawing No. MTC-B-09-TB-L1.0_0.__-005 Rev. 00 attached to
our letter dated 23 November 2014, shows a fundamental difference between the two (refer to Figures
4 and 5 below). It is patently clear therefore that the original IFC Drawing failed to show any setting-out
details, specific shapes, sizes or dimensions of the directional arrows to the BHS areas to Level L1.0.
Figure 4 - IFC Drawing No. MTC-B-09-TB-L1.0_0.__-005 Rev. 00
‘Terminal Building BHS General Arrangement L1.0 (Apron)’
Figure 5 - BHS L1.0 Floor Marking Setting Out Drawing
Issued on 8 January 2020 via email [3:43 PM]
In summary therefore, we record that the drawings issued by the Employer on 8 January 2020 finally
show the requisite setting-out details, shapes, sizes and dimensions of the directional arrows to the BHS
areas to Level L1.0, which the original IFC Drawings / Contract Drawings failed to do so; and reflect
works that is additional to our scope. This will necessitate that you issue these Drawings as IFC under an
Engineer’s Instruction / Variation Order, if you require the additional work to be undertaken by us.
We therefore take this opportunity in also reminding you of the provisions of Clauses 2.29 to 2.31 of
Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’) pertaining to Variations, in so far as we are not to
proceed with any Variation unless a Variation Order and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. In
which respect, it is your obligation to issue this Record first if you wish to instigate change; this is only
after the additional time and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.

Until such time as you take the action required of you in accordance with SAA8 Clause 2.29, and issue
the Drawings as IFC together with an EI, we are unable to proceed with implementing any changes to
the floor painting to L1.0 and will continue with the Works in accordance with the current IFC Drawings.
Given this information was not provided until 8 January 2020 despite us requesting it on 3 December
2014, this cannot possibly be construed as forming part of or ‘Included Circumstances’ (per Clause 1.7.4
of SAA8) and will be included within any forthcoming Time Impact Analysis, albeit in recognition of the
Effective Date included in SAA8, any delays will be analysed from 4 September 2018 onwards. SAA8
cannot reasonably be interpreted as requiring the Contractor to absorb delays of unknown (possibly
unlimited) duration both pre and post 4 September 2018, particularly where the resolution of the
matter causing the delay lies with the Employer. We contend therefore that under the circumstances
the responsibility, under the Contract (as amended by SAA8), for such delays lies with the Employer.
Potential Impact:
Any requirement for additional works, in this case, additional floor painting, at such a late stage of the
Project, is very likely to impact upon our ability to achieve Milestone MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required:
It is for this reason therefore that we issue this E-Notice requesting your prompt action, guidance,
decision or further instruction as may be applicable to resolve the matters referenced herein in order to
mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works. This includes without limitation:
1.
Issuing such Instruction as necessary for us to instigate the required changes into the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within ten (10) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
Yours faithfully,
