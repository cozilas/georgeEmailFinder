Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer’s assistant’s informal request, the Contractor encloses herewith as attachments
1) and 2) to this letter a preliminary estimate related to the power supply of the Mock-Up facilities for
two (2) years by means of either:

1.

maintaining the current temporary power arrangements, or;

2.

applying for a permanent connection to the Kahramaa grid instead.

In doing so, for the purpose of enabling the decision-making process, the Contractor has estimated the
costs for the power supply of both the Gold Line and the Major Stations mock-up facilities as indicative
of the total expenditure associated with each of those two (2) options likely to be incurred by the
Employer.

Mock-Up Running Costs (QR)
Temporary Power (Option 1)

3,360,000

Permanent Power (Option 2)

4,800,000

The Contractor further notes the anticipated disruption to the Mock-up access associated with option 2
since the electrical duct bank that would be required for the laying of the MV feeders to the 1000 kVA
packaged substation can only be casted below (and across the entire length) of the access road.

Additionally the Engineer’s assistant requested informally from the Contractor to investigate the
conversion of the temporary Mock-up facilities into permanent facilities, which are to be open to public
visits. The Contractor is therefore investigating with a specialized design consultant which legal,
technical and permitting issues have to be resolved at the Mock-up facilities prior to allow such usage.
Any costs related to such conversion are not included in the above cost estimate.

Yours faithfully,
