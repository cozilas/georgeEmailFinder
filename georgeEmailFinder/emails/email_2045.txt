Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer’s Assistant letter of reference 1) and the Engineer’s Instructions of reference 5)
and 6) issued pursuant to General Condition (“GC”) 13.1.1 of Volume 3 of the Contract, the Contractor
encloses herewith particulars in relation to the design works deriving from the varied scope. This
evaluation supersedes the Contractor’s request for on-account payments previously communicated to
you via letters references 2) and 3).

The quantities contained herein as Attachment 1) refer to the design abortive cost incurred via these
variations and they exclude any other cost related to construction, provisional sums or other. Volume 2,
Pricing Document C - Sections of Works (SoW) has been used for the estimation of the quantities, as
follows: the rates for items B.1.a, C.3.t, along with the total Station Construction rate have been used to
proportionally derive the rates for the Passageways’ design, as also described in Attachment 1).

Further to the above, the design stage circa the time the Engineer instructed the Contractor via letters
reference 5) and 6) has also been considered to this evaluation. An assessment of the design stage for
each Station has been included herein as Attachment 2) and considered in Attachment 1) to derive the
final amount.

At present, the design abortive cost incurred via these variations is of the net amount of QAR
28,640,212.62 as detailed in Attachment 1). The Contractor reserves its rights to recover any time
related costs in connection to this Variation which shall be addressed under a separate cover.

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.

Yours faithfully,
