Dear Sir,

Further to the Contractor's formal Notice issued under cover of reference 2 in accordance with General
Conditions ("GC") 3.3.3, 8.4.2 and 20.1.2 concerning the Engineer's Instruction Nr 51 instructing the
Employer's Additional Requirements to Ras Bu Abboud's Stabling Yard, Light Maintenance and
TrainWashing Facility ("the Event"), the Contractor hereby encloses its formal interim submission
(Revision 0) for Claim Nr 023 in accordance with GC 3.3.4, GC 8.4.4 and GC 20.1.6.

The submission is addressed as "Claim Nr 023" in accordance with the Engineer's Assistant's reference 1
requirements and further to the Contractor's Notice which clearly states that it is given pursuant to GC
20.1.2 ("Contractor's Claims").

As the Event has a continuing effect, the attached submission is to be considered as interim in
accordance with GC 20.1.6(a). The Contractor shall therefore be submitting further interim subm issions
with respect to the Event at monthly intervals as required by GC 20.1.6(b).

In addition, the Contractor will be submitting, as soon as possible, its Variation Engineering Proposal
(fully priced and programmed) pursuant to GC 13.5 which will be based upon the latest alternative
solution known to be acceptable in principle to the Employer (Contractor's attached e mail of 09 June
2015 from Mr. Tassos Naoum to the Employer's Mr. Samuel McChesney refers).
Yours faithfully,
