Damage to Passenger Boarding Bridge at GH10 by Employerâ€™s Other Contractor

Dear Sir,
We have become aware that a completed Passenger Boarding Bridge (PBB) located at Gate House 10
was damaged by another contractor directly engaged by the Employer.
As shown on the attached report, excavation works were undertaken without our knowledge in close
proximity to the PBB on 29 January 2020. We believe these works were undertaken by L&T. Following
the completion of the excavation an inspection identified damage to the PBB in question.
Once a detailed report is completed by the PBB subcontractor we shall be submitting further details of
the impact incurred due to this incident. In the meantime we request the Engineer to issue an
Instruction to provide a proposal for the time and cost impact associated with rectifying the damaged
caused.

Yours faithfully,
