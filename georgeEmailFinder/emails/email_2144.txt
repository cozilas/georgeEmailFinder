Dear Sir,
The Engineer's Assistant (EA) refers to letter at reference 1) above, wherein the Contractor was directed
to submit a quotation under Sub-Clause 13.2.2 for Engineer's consideration for any adjustment to the
Contract Price and Schedule of Payments. To date, more than 360 days later, the Contractor still has not
submitted his quotation despite the reminder letters referenced at 2). 3) and 4) above.

In light of the above, EA requires the Contractor to submit, within 14 days of receipt of this letter, a full
and finalestimate in the form of quotation under Sub-Clause 13.2.2,which should include the following:

(a)

a detailed scope of the Variation (including any drawings or technical details);

(b)

a detailed breakdown of the price for which the Contractor would carry out the Variation;

(c)

the effect (if any)of the proposed Variation on the Time for Completion and the programme.

In addition, in accordance with the provisions of Sub-Clause 13.6.1 "Valuation of Variation" the Engineer
shall proceed in accordance with Sub-Clause 3.5 "Determinations", where this letter serves to offer the
Contractor an opportunity to consult with the Engineer to agree the value of Variation prior to issuing a
notice under Sub-Clause 3.5.

Notwithstanding the abovementioned, EA reiterates that for proposed variations as well as for var ied
works the Contractor should use the contractual mechanism provided by Clause 13 and awaits the
Contra tor withdrawal of Claim Number 32.
Yours faithfully,
