Delay Notice – Late Delivery of Materials

Dear Sir,
This is to inform you of your failure to deliver the motorized floor access door (MFAD) and motorized
floor hatches type APP11, despite numerous reminders sent to you on their critical delivery time. We
put on record that the materials were expected to arrive by end of December 2018 as stated in your
email (Tue 13-Nov-18, 11:34AM) referenced in our letter (1) above.
At the time of writing, you have confirmed booking the materials shipment on 6th January 2018 and the
shipment is only expected arriving on 3rd February 2018. We note that the mismanagement of this issue
and the late delivery of materials have caused serious disruptions and delays to the progress of works.
As a reminder, we refer you to our email (2), where we stated that the arriving port should be Abu Dhabi
instead of Dubai in order to obtain the exemption on tax free for the MTB Project. In this case, TCAJV
will not be responsible for any additional taxes to be charged by the Dubai Port.
We reiterate, that any delays, costs, claims, losses and/or expenses and the like incurred by us and/or
Other Subcontractors arising as a result of your failure to complete the aforementioned activities will be
solely your responsibility as per the Subcontract Agreement Clauses including but not limited to 10.3
[Contractor’s Claims], 12.12.4 [Other Contractors and Other Subcontractors] and 16.6 [Delay Damages].

This is for your information, records, and immediate action.
Yours faithfully,
