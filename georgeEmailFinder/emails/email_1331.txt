Dear Sir,
We wish to record our concerns at PCEJV's ongoing delays in providing approved material to achieve
timely completion of the mechanical works, with specific concern to the secondary steel pipe
supports work for main chilled water piping installations in Level 0.1 of Piers.
Despite of several reminders and our letter MTB/TCA/PCEJV /L/000279 dated 25 March 2014, PCEJV
has failed to expedite the approval, delivery and installation of grout material normally grouting of
baseplate should be done. "Prior to loading steel support" as mentioned by lntercool in the attached
e-mail correspondence dated 9 July 2014. Therefore, PCEJV is again requested to confirm target date
of completion of each activity so that TCAJV can monitor progress.
You are hereby instructed to proceed with all the necessary action immediately to mitigate further
delay. Failing such, we shall have no alternative but to back charge any delay and disruption cost
related to your contract work and other trades affected according to Subcontract Clause 1&.6.1. We
are keeping the contemporary records and we shall write to you again when this information is
available.
We look forward for your urgent response and action.

Yours faithfully,
