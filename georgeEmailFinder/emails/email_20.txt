Subject:Overdue Payments and Pending Execution-Signature of the Subcontract Order
With reference to the above subject, we write to inform you regarding your failure to release our due
payments, as well as, your failure to execute the Subcontract Order (SO).
Specifically, on 13 September 2020, we have signed and submitted the SO ref: FL-AD.5/2/748/, for the
concrete workmanship services carried out by us, on the abovementioned Project.
We put on record that at the date of writing, despite our numerous requests for you to proceed with the
execution of the SO, you have failed to do so, thus we are yet to receive the signed SO.
Notwithstanding, in good faith, we have commenced with the works on site on 21 September 2020 and
have progressed significantly. As a result, we have submitted our Interim Payment Applications (IPA) No.
1 and No.2, according to Clause-9 of the SO, in the manner shown in Table 1 below
However, at the date of writing this letter (8 December 2020), the payments for our IPA No. 1 and No. 2,
are overdue as shown below.
For clarity, Table 1 below sets out more information regarding the IPAs, in the following manner:

you;

The delays of the release of our payments are causing detrimental cashflow and financial issues to our
company and have impacted and will continue to impact our ability to progress with the works
constructively. Moreover, it is affecting our ability to settle our financial obligations not only to our
suppliers, creditors but most importantly, the wages of our staff and workers.
Please note that we have been supporting and financing the Project since the commencement date, but
our ability to continue to do so, has already been significantly affected and will continue to be negatively
affected, in the event the payments are further delayed.
In view of the foregoing, this is to inform you that, in case we do not receive our due payments within
seven (7) days from receipt of this letter, we will suspend the works, and you will be held for repudiatory
breach of the contract.
In addition, you will be held fully responsible for any delays that may occur as a result of the above.

In summary, we request you to release our overdue payment and the official executed Subcontract
Order at the earliest.
We trust you find the aforementioned self-explanatory and clarifies the matter, and you will carry out
the necessary action as a matter of urgency.
Yours faithfully,
