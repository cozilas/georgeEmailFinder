Subject: PCEJV Notification of Dispute - Generator Exhaust System Scope and
Dear Sir,
We acknowledge receipt of your letter reference MTB/PCEJV/TCAJ?/ L/02879 dated 15th October 2016,
a follow up to your correspondence reference MTB/PCEJV /TCAJV / L/02666 dated 25th August 2016
being that of a response to our previous communication MTB/TCA/PCEJV/L/003936 dated 22"d
September 2016 on the subject matter 'Generator Exhaust System Scope and Instruction to Proceed Notification of Dispute', and would respond as follows to the contents within.
The issue of scope ownership associated with the Generator Exhaust System is that of a protracted
debate that has lasted over four months, commencing with that of the instruction issued under the
Subcontract Conditions, culminating in that of verbal confirmation from PCEJV that the original
instruction of these works issued under Letter Reference MTB/ TCA/PCEJV/L/003370 on 21st May 2016
was rejected on the basis that despite substantiation being given by us over a plethora of
correspondences, the instruction to proceed would not be actioned as it were perceived by you that
such works did not form part of your contracted works. The rejection of this instruction being that of a
clear breach of the Subcontract Agreement between us, by you.
Nevertheless, due to the receipt of your Formal Notification of Dispute in this regard, we are again
compelled to further substantiate our assessment of the same and present them so as to enable such
resolution in the matter to be achieved.
Resolution of the same will be in strict accordance with that of Clause 27.3 (Dispute Resolution) of the
Conditions of Subcontract which form an integral part of the Subcontract Agreement between us.
For the record we disagree with your allegation that a dispute had already been acknowledged over the
Generator Exhaust System. You have in attempt to bypass your contractual obligations as highlighted in
our Letter Reference MTB/TCA/PCEJV/L/003936 dated 22"d September 2016 by taking out of context
OL!r statement that ' .... due to the receipt of your correspondence in this regard we are in the process
of formalising our response, however the requirement of the disputed scope in question .... .'. Our
response in this matter was based on your argumentative, debated and wrangled position on the
matter, in short disputed. In this instance all that highlighted was your dispute in the matter I refusal to
comply with the Subcontract Conditions. In summary we completely reject your allegation that 'the
Contractor that its failure to acknowledge a legitimate Notice of Dispute under the Subcontract
Agreement, is in contradiction of its obligation to use all reasonable endeavours to settle the dispute
within 30 days of the dispute notice ... .'. It would appear from your correspondence and allegations in

this matter that it is you that is in contradiction of its obligation to use such endeavours to settle such an
agreement prior to issuance of Dispute Notice.
Nevertheless, In accordance with that of Clause 27.3.1 an interim meeting will be confirmed under cover
of separate letter whereas each party shall use all reasonable endeavours to send a representative who
has authority to settle the dispute or difference at such a dispute meeting. In accordance with the
aforementioned Clause such a meeting will take place on or before 2ih September 2016, the same being
30 days after receipt of your Letter
Reference MTB/PCEJV/TCAJV/L/02666 dated 25th August 2016 (Received 28th August 2016).
Please find attached our determination in this matter of which the same clearly clarifies our position.
If you seek further clarification to the content of this letter, please do not hesitate to contact the
undersigned.
Yours faithfully,
