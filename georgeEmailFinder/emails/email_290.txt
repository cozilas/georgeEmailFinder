Subject:Post SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0153

Engineer’s Response to RFI/0401/17066 – SACS and Door Hardware Changes to Door No ‘L000397.01’ due to omission of Door ‘L00-0397.02’ – Request for Engineer’s Instruction (RFEI) / Variation
Order (VO)
Dear Sir
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and/or disruption to the Works and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
Your response to RFI/0401/17066 detailed in Annex A represents a change in design and scope and
requires a valid EI and VO in order for us to integrate the same into the Works.
Potential Impact
Any requirement for additional works, such as that outlined herein and at this stage of the Project, is
likely to impact on the achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within seven (7) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
On 28 April 2019, we raised RFI/0401/17066 [dated 23 April 2019]
‘Omission of Door
Added in Bulletin 157 for EMD Room’:
“The attached extract from Bulletin 157 architectural IFC drawing MTC-A-02-TB-L0.0-5.27-00.427 shows
a second door added for the emergency distribution room at the time when the blower coil serving the
room was installed in the same location as per the mechanical IFC and approved shop drawing …”
“We note that the blower coil is already installed and the adjacent wall is occupied with electrical
services as shown in the attached site photo”.
Simply put while Door Ref: L00-0397.02 (serving the Emergency Distribution Room to Level L0.0 in
Sector 5.27) was indicated on Architectural IFC Drawing No: MTC-A-02-TB-L0.0-5.27-00.427, it is not
reflected upon Mechanical IFC Drawings No: MTC-M-02-TB-L0.0-5.27-00.001 (refer to Figure 1 and 2
below for a detailed comparison between both drawings); rather a ‘blower coil is already installed and
the adjacent wall is occupied with electrical services’ (the photo included at Figure 3 refers).

equipment to Room 397
Accordingly, we asked that you clarify and confirm whether Door Ref: ‘L00-0397.02 was required or not
given that there is already a second door ‘L00-0397.01’ within the same room. Although the Abu Dhabi
Electricity Wiring Regulations states that in such circumstances a second door is not required, we
nevertheless sought your further clarification and confirmation of the same; as follows:
“… the note in the attached extract from the Abu Dhabi Electricity Wiring Regulations states that a
second door is required for personnel if a switchroom is greater than 6m in length. Since the subject
room is an EMD room and not a switchroom, please confirm that the code does not apply in this case
and therefore the second door for the room is not required”

We requested a response to RFI/0401/17066 by 4 May 2019. However, you failed to reply until 40
calendar days later on 13 June 2019. Notwithstanding the prolonged period in responding, as in its reply
to RFI/0401/17066, the Employer’s Design Consultant (KPF) confirmed the following
“As reviewed by ADAC, we have no objection to the contractor interpretation of the Electrical Code
requirements for EMD room in terms of a second door need. Note: Contractor to secure/ensure
approval from relevant authorities and AHJ (including but no limited to ADDC).”
Accordingly we were referred to two sketches attached thereto enumerated as ‘ASK-4073 (RFI-17066)
Sheet 1 of 2 and Sheet 2 of 2’; consisting of: (1) a marked up / clouded IFC Drawing; and (2), a partial
extract of a revised Door Schedule. We note that both the marked up / clouded IFC Drawing (an extract
of which is reproduced in Figure 4) and the partial revised Door Schedule, both confirmed the omission
of Door ref: ‘L00-0397.02’. The latter is essential in so far as it not only confirmed the omission of the
door but also provided confirmation of the final technical requirements of Door ref: ‘L00-0397.01’.
Notably however, some of these requirements (i.e. the door hardware and SACS type and associated
works have changed). Refer to the comparison provided in Table 1 hereinafter.

All of the above changes were explained in KPFs response to RFI/0401/17066, wherein KPF confirmed
that it had “no objection” for the second door to EMD room (Door #L0.0-0397.02) to be omitted,
“provided that associated SACS 2A is transferred to the other door (door #L0.0-0397.01).”
In the same manner, the Employer concurred with KPF’s response but advised the following:
“Contractor to secure/ensure approval from relevant authorities. Engineer to confirm/ensure that the
Contractor has coordinated with all services prior to WIR sign-off. Confirmation to be stated in the
WIR.”
In view of the foregoing, such changes will result in us having to undertake the following activities or
processes, which will involve the coordination of numerous subcontractors:
•
Associated abortive works due to the omission of Door ref: ‘L0.0-0397.02’;
•
Installation of Card Reader to Door ‘L0.0-0397.01’;
•
Changes to the Door’s Hardware;
•
Installation of electrified Door Hardware to Door ‘L0.0-0397.01’;
•
Installation of additional conduits; and
•
Re-wiring to match the new SACS ‘2A’ configuration of Door ‘L0.0-0397.01’;
On this basis, it is clear that given your response to RFI/0401/17066, the omission of Door ‘L0.0-0397.02’
as well as the changes to Door ‘L0.0-0397.01’ involving the SACS and Door Hardware and related works
to EMD Emergency Distribution Room Level 0.0 Sector 5.27, reflected upon the revised Door Schedule
appended thereto, represents a change. However, given that SAA8 laid down strict guidelines to follow
if additional works are required [and in this instance you appear to have ignored those obligations], then
this change will warrant a valid Engineer’s Instruction (EI) and a Variation Order (VO) if you require us to
proceed with integrating the revised scope into the Works.

We remind you of the provisions of Clause 2.29 to Clause 2.31 of SAA8 pertaining to Variations, in so far
as we are not to proceed with any Variation until a VO and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. It
is your obligation to issue this Time/Cost Record first if you wish to instigate change; but this is only after
the additional time and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.
Yours faithfully,
