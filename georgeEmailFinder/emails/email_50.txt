Dears,
With this letter, we wish to kindly notify you regarding our request for an early termination of our Lease
Agreement dated 25th October 2019, which has been mutually agreed and signed between us, with
commencement date 15th December 2019 and expiry date 14th December 2020, for the office no.
2901, located at Concord Tower, Sufouh – 2 area in Dubai.
Our request is a result of the on-going situation associated with the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic,
which has had and is continuing to have a sustained major financial impact on our Company, hence we
are compelled to pursue actions to cut-down costs and seek for other arrangements in regards to the
premises of our office.
In view of the above, we wish to inform you of the following:
Pursuant to Clause 7 [Termination] of the Lease Agreement, it states the following:

“(…) 7.1. This Lease may be terminated prior to the Expiry Date by the mutual agreement of the
Landlord and the Tenant in which case the Landlord will return to the Tenant the paid amount of the
unrented period. (…)”
In view of the foregoing, we write to you (the ‘Landlord’) to kindly request and mutually agree between
us, on an early Termination of the Lease Agreement, effective immediately and closed by 31 August
2020.
Consequently, we kindly request that you return the “the unrented period” as stated in Clause 7.1, and
specifically the remaining cheques dated 25th September 2020 (AED 41,814.00) and the ‘Refundable
Deposit’ amount equal to AED 16,726.00.
We trust that you are in agreement with the above and you would take prompt necessary actions as a
matter of urgency. Should the need arise for any further clarification on the matter, kindly do not
hesitate to contact us.
Please confirm the receipt of this letter, by returning a signed copy.
Yours faithfully
