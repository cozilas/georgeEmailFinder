Dear sir
We recently sent you a transmittal #1 carrying Engineers Instruction El No. 544 amongst other things. It
has come to our knowledge that TCAJV have disputed this El and we would like to recall this from you
until further instructions.
We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.

Dear sir
We acknowledge receipt of your letter referenced in (3} above requesting us to return the Bond for
cancellation by your bank.
However, please be advised that the proper procedure as per Subcontract as well as the conditions
stated
within the Advance Payment Guarantee should be followed and complied with.
Therefore in this regard, we cannot automatically return one (1) Bond but the val~e of all four (4) Bonds
shall
be reduced proportionately by the same percentage of the amount already recovered as indicated in the
latest Interim Payment Certificate.
Â·This is for your information and record.
Yours faithfully,
