Engineer’s Response to RFI/0401/17305 – Introduction of Door No. ‘L32-2315-01’ – Request for
Engineer’s Instruction (RFEI) / Variation Order (VO)
Dear Sir
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and/or disruption to the Works and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
Your response to RFI/0401/17305 detailed in Annex A represents a change in design and scope and
requires a valid EI and VO in order for us to integrate the same into the Works.
Potential Impact
Any requirement for additional works, such as that outlined herein and at this stage of the Project, is
likely to impact on the achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within seven (7) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
On 17 July 2019, we raised RFI/0401/17305 Rev. 00 requesting clarification as to whether Door Ref:
‘L32-2315-01’ (Located at Staircase 05/62 to Level L3.2 Sector 5.31), was required or not; in order to
overcome an anomaly in and between the IFC Documents in so far as Door Ref: ‘L32-2315-01’ was
shown indicatively on the IFC Drawings (refer to Figure 1), but was not included in the Door Schedule.
Figure 1
Specifically, via RFI/0401/17305 we wrote as follows:
“The door schedule does not include the door 2315.01 at level 3.2, kindly update the door schedule
including the missing door. Please provide an Engineer’s Instruction to add the door”

We requested a response to RFI/0401/17305 Rev. 00 by 24 July 2019; however, you failed to reply until
15 calendar days later on 8 August 2019. Notwithstanding, your response to RFI/0401/17305 Rev. 00
referred us to two attached sketches enumerated as ‘ASK 4096 (RFI 17305)’ Sheet 1 of 2 and Sheet 2 of
2; consisting of (1) a marked up / clouded IFC Drawing; and (2) a partial extract of a revised Door
Schedule. The latter is essential in so far as it provided confirmation of the specific door type, material,
colour, width, height, finish and fire rating etc., plus details pertaining to the requisite hardware – none
of which had previously been provided but are nevertheless essential to enable us to procure, and install
the door and door hardware and undertake any and all associated works.
On this basis, it is clear that given your response to RFI/0401/17305 Rev. 00 and the introduction of door
‘L32-2315-01’ and related works to Staircase 05/62 to Level L3.2 Sector 5.31 reflected upon the revised
Door Schedule appended thereto, represents a change. However, given that SAA8 laid down strict
guidelines to follow if additional works are required and you appear to have ignored those obligations,
then this change will warrant a valid Engineer’s Instruction (EI) and a Variation Order (VO) if you require
us to proceed with integrating the revised scope into the Works.
We remind you of the provisions of Clause 2.29 to Clause 2.31 of SAA8 pertaining to Variations, in so far
as we are not to proceed with any Variation until a VO and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. It
is your obligation to issue this Time/Cost Record first if you wish to instigate change; but this is only after
the additional time and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.
Meanwhile, until such time as you take the action required of you in accordance with SAA8 Clause 2.29,
we are unable to proceed with implementing the changes noted herein. We trust this is clear.
Yours faithfully,
