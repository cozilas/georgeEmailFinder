Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to letter reference 1) whereby the Engineer proposed for the Contractor's
consideration and agreement the Employer's entitlement to cost savings in relation to the Variation of
the Employer's Requirements in respect of tunnel cross passageway spacing.

The Contractor acknowledges receipt of the Engineer's proposal pursuant to Sub-Clause 3.5 of the
General Conditions of Contract.

In this respect, the Contractor confirms that the Engineer's considerations that the cost savings should
be based on the tendered schedule of rates for the provision of cross passageways.

However, further to the review of the Engineer's proposal, the Contractor has identified a Contractor
originated calculation error which must be corrected. This calculation error is related to item "Any
testing and commissioning as deemed necessary in accordance with Employer's requirements (C8)
(Revised Design)".

In its submission under reference M006-GDB-COM-LTR-02821 dated 05 January 2016, the Contractor
adjusted the value of this item only by reference to the revised total length of the cross passages and did
not consider at all the total tunnel length per section. This error has now been corrected and the revised
calculation is enclosed herewith for the Engineer's ratification.

In addition to the above, the Contractor hereby records its disagreement with the following Engineer's
considerations:

1.
"Entitlement to time-based cost savings or savings associated with a reduction in construction
risk have not been considered at this stage. " The Contractor avers that since the cost savings are based
on the tendered schedule of rates for the provision of cross passageways, such savings are included
therein.
-2:-The-contractoravers-thatihe Engineer's-calculation of he-abortive-design is erroneous:-The
weighting of work associated to the cross passageways design cannot be calculated by reference to the
length of the cross passageways. This way of calculation might be computationally correct, however, it is
completely wrong from an engineering perspective.
3. The Contractor notes the Engineer's adjustment to the cost of the Engineering Analysis Report to
reflect the Contractor's valuation of ATKINS' rates. However, ATKINS has disputed the Contractor's

valuation of rates. In the event that ATKINS receives an arbitration award confirming their rates, the
Contractor reserves the right to claim the full amount from the Employer.
Further to the above, the Engineer is kindly requested to taking into consideration the Contractor's
arguments presented herein and revise its proposal pursuant to Sub-Clause 3.5 of the General
Conditions of Contract accordingly.

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.
Yours faithfully,
