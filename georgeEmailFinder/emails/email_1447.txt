Dear Sir,
The Engineer's Assistant judges actual progress of Mock-up fit-out works, 1:1 concourse and shelter as
being too slow and not in accordance with the attached Contractor's Mock-up Programme. The
Contractor has failed to meet the programmed date for commencement of the Fit-out of the Concourse
and commencement of work for the 1:1 Shelter mockup on the 11January and 9 January 2016
respectively.

The above failure and subsequent impact on completion of the Mock-ups, will clearly incur significant
delay in final inspection and selection of the materials and in addition introduces a significant risk of
delaying the overall project completion.

It is noted that the Contractor has failed to develop and procure key materials for indusion within the
Mock- up despite having given an undertaking to do so as far back as November 2015. The Contractor
has yet to fulfill this undertaking.

Repeated requests have been made on numerous occasions for a detailed Procurement Schedule, which
again the Contractor has failed to deliver.

This is an instruction under Sub-Clause 8.5.1 that the Contractor must submit, under Sub-Clause 8.3
(Programme), a revised Programme and supporting report describing the revised methods which the
Contractor proposes to adopt in order to expedite progress and complete the Mock-up Works within the
time for completion.

The revised programme and report is required to be submitted within seven (7) days from receipt of this
instruction.

The Contr ctor's failure to address the above will leave the Employer and the Engineer's Assistant no
alternative ut to consider additional remedies under the Contract.

Yours faithfully,
