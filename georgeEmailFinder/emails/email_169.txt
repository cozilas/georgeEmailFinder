Subject Notice to Correct- Shortage of Manpower ANEL
Dear Sir,
Further to correspondence (1) and (2) wherein the Engineer issued a Notice to Correct pursuant to
Clause 12.9.6 of the Conditions of Contract regarding the Contractor's Subcontractors shortage in
manpower (ANEL, PCEJV (NAFFCO), Jangho, Mosart, Bond and Chadwick) .
We record that the Contractor has failed to implement any measures or take any actions in order to
rectify the manpower shortages. We note with concern that ANEL's resources have decreased in the
past two weeks and as a result Testing and Commissioning has been adversely affected. From 2400
planned direct resources the actual resources on site are 1184 i.e. a shortage of 1216 resources.
In light of the above, the Notice pursuant to Clause 12.9.6 of the Conditions of Contract remains and
we reserve the Employer's rights pursuant to Clause 12.10.3 of the Conditions of Contract and request
that the Contractor implements immediate measures to rectify th is issue.
Yours faithfully,
