Subject:Request for Broken Glass Schedule – Reminder I
Dear Sir,
The Contractor writes with reference to the request for a detailed broken glass schedule made in its
letter (1) which remains unanswered to date.
Although the Contractor has repeatedly reminded the Subcontractor of the criticality of a reliable
tracker for further coordination with both the Employer and other trades, the Subcontractor persists in
ignoring the Contractor’s demands and the requested schedule has not yet been provided. Evidence of
the Subcontractor’s inaction is attached herewith.
The Contractor reiterates its request that the Subcontractor submits the required tracker which shall
include, at least, the following information:
Reference/coding for each of the defective glass items which are allegedly damaged and require
replacement.
The observation/incident report associated to each damaged glass panel clearly identifying
when and how such damage occurred.
A detailed schedule clearly depicting the procurement, delivery and installation dates for each
and every glass panel.
The Contractor must have a clear picture of the status of these remedial works and therefore requests
the Subcontractor to make good its failure and provide this information within three Days from this
notice.
MTB/TCA/JANGHO/L/001638
The Contractor reminds that its rights under the provisions of Clause 10.3 [Contractor’s Claims] and
Clause 16.6 [Delay Damages] of the Conditions of Subcontract are reserved.
Yours faithfully,
