Clearance of Landscaping Parcels

Dear Sir,
Please find attached the Engineer’s letter reference (1) which notifies of the requirement to clear the
landscaping areas shown in the enclosed layout. Please note that these parcels are to be vacated in
accordance with the access dates required by the Landscape Contractor(s).
The Contractor has identified that the Subcontractor is currently using Parcel No. 11 as laydown area
and/or welfare facility. Please be informed that access to this area shall be granted to the Landscape
Contractor(s) by 09 December 2018.
Consequently, the Contractor serves the Subcontractor this notification that all its stored materials shall
be removed from this parcel before this date. Should the Subcontractor fail to proceed in accordance
with this instruction and vacate the area by the given date, please be notified that the Subcontractor will
be held responsible for any claim made by the Employer vis-à-vis any delays to the landscaping works.
If the Subcontractor still requires shifting its materials to a different location within the Site boundaries,
please be kindly requested to coordinate the location with Mr. Mahmoud Said (Utilities & Interface
Manager) on 056 163 7337.
Yours faithfully,
