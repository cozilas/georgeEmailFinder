Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to letter references 1) and 2) whereby the Engineer's Assistant requested a
programme for the design and construction of a pedestrian Underpass between Joaan station and the Al
Sadd mall complex.

Further to the quotation provided under letter reference 3), the Contractor encloses herewith the
additional subway works programme based on the following assumptions:

The Contractor receives the Engineer's Instruction to vary pursuant to Sub-Clauses 3.1.4, 3.3, 13.1.1 and
13.1.2 of the Contract no later than 30 April2016;

The enabling works (such as the demolition of the existing building) are completed and the handing-over
of the necessary land to the Contractor takes place no later 30 September 2016;
The Contractor's Master Programme is not impacted by the issuing of additional l;ngineer's Instructions
that affect the subways and/or entrances; if the CMP is impacted, this will have an impact on the 08
June 2017 date for the start of the construction Works.

In addition, the Engineer's Assistant is hereby informed that that these additional works will require no
extension to the Time for Completion only if the cumulative criteria described above and included as
constraints in the enclosed programme are met.

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification. Yours faithfully,
