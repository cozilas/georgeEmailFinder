Subject:Outstanding Payment to Sub-Subcontractor
Dear Sir,
We write in response to your letter reference MTB/TCA/MOSART/L/000534 dated 28th February
2018 received on 4th March 2018.
Mosart Marble & Mosaic International S.A.L have suffered additional costs and damages as a result
of the poor performance of M/S Plus Pa inting (Screed Works Subcontractor). We enclose a copy of
our letter reference MMM/16/PPW/007 dated 27th March 2016 in support of this statement.
We shall furnish the detailed particulars of our counter claim to M/S Plus Paint for their
agreement/settlement, failing which we shall pursue our full contractual and legal rights pursuant
to the Subcontract Agreement we have with M/S Plus Paints. In the meantime any failure to settle
amounts due on our account as a result of the poor performance of M/S Plus Paints will also be
levied against the Subcontractor as further damages arising directly from their breach of our
Subcontract Agreement with M/S Plus Paints.
You are reminded that withholding a valid payment entitlement for works done under our contract
constitutes a breach of contract, giving rise to a cause of action for damages and other remedies. In
the event that we suffer such damages and additional costs as a result of the failure of the TCAJV to
make payment with respect to this issue, and such sums are not recoverable from our
Subcontractor, we shall seek to recover the same, plus interest and damages from the TCAJV.
Yours faithfully,
