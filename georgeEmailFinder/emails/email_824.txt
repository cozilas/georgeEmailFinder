Reply â€“ Renewed Workmen Compensation Insurance

Dear Sir,
We acknowledge receipt of your letter referenced in (5) above and we reiterate our position made vide
our letter referenced in (4), wherein we stated that the limit of liability for the Workmen Compensation
Policy should be unlimited in the aggregate.
Please be advised that the previously policy that was accepted as confirmed in our letter
MTB/TCA/SEELE/L/000092 dated 17th July 2017, was erroneously approved by our Finance department.
Therefore, you are kindly requested to correct and amend your policy as per our comments made herein
in order to close this matter and avoid delays to any future payments.

This is for your information and necessary action.
Yours faithfully,
