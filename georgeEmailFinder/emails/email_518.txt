Delays to Gatehouses 3 & 4 due to MTA Contractor Works and Sewer Collapse

Dear Sir,
We refer to our e-Notice 0038 and to the fact that our works in the area of gatehouses 3 and 4 are being
delayed by the ongoing works by Other Contractors and the lack of instruction in respect of the
rectification of the failed sewer and storm water installations.
Your letter noted above in (1) seems to have been written in isolation from the fact that for reasons for
which we have demonstrated we are not responsible, the sewer and storm water installations have
subsided and we are awaiting instruction in respect of the method by which you require this subsidence
to be rectified.
We therefore counter your reference to rights under Clause 10.3 of the Contract as being inappropriate
to the current situation and in reference to the second paragraph and to the closing sentence of your
letter, we request your clear instruction as to how we are to ‘complete the sewer installation and
backfilling works’, ‘immediately’.
Yours faithfully,
