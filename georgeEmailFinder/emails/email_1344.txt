Dear Sir,

Further to the Contractor's formal Claim Nr 001 November 2014 update interim submission issued
under cover of reference 14 and subsequent monthly updates, the Contractor now confirms, in
accordance with SubÂ¬ Clause 20.1.6(b) of the General Conditions of the Contract (Volume 3), the
following updated costs in relation to the incorrect/late rejection of Gulf Prefab House Factory LLC for
the provision of the Contractor's offices.

The Contractor has now revised the costs to Sections 8.3, 8.4, 8.5 and Section 9 of Claim Nr 001
November 2014 update interim submission and additionally now provides financing costs so incurred.

Section 8.3 - Gulf Prefab Abortive Design Costs

Gulf Prefab has now provided the Contractor with revised costs of QAR 400,500 .00 regarding its claim
for its abortive design. Details of Gulf Prefab's claim are attached to this letter.

Section 8.4 - Contractor 's Additional Temporary Office Lease Costs

Gulf Prefab's programme estimated that the Contractor's site office would be complete by 16 December
2014.

The estimated completion date for Spacemaker to provide the Contractor's site office was the end of
January 2015 .Consequently , the Contractor was initially forced to extend the lease on its rented office
space on Airport Road, Doha until 31 January 2015.

However, it was only the Employer/Engineer/Engineer's Assistant site office that was scheduled to be
complete by 31 January 2015, the completion date for the Contractor's site office was 10 March 2015 .
The Contractor therefore further extended its Airport Road Office leases from 31 January 2015 until 31
March 2015, thereby incurring total additional office rental costs from 17 December 2014 until 31
March 2015, a sum of 105 days.

The Contractor can confirm that the monthly rental for the total temporary office space is OAR 533,874
.00. In the month of December 2014, the Contractor extended the lease by 15 days (from 17 December
2014 up to and including 31 December 2014), the additional cost incurred is calculated as follows:
QAR 533,874.00 (monthly rental) I 31 days (calendar month) x 15 days (period of extension) = QAR
258,326.00

The Contractor has incurred a full month lease/rentalcost for the month of January, February and March
2015 that equates to OAR 1,601,622.00.

Thus, the total additional office lease/rental cost incurred by the Contractor is QAR 258,326.00 + QAR
1,601,622.00 = OAR 1,859,948.00.
Section 8.5 - Contractor 's Overheads & Profit

The Contractor's Overheads and Profit (OHP) accrued on the costs incurred is 13%.The table below
computes the OHP for each cost section.
