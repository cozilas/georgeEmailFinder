Dear Sir,

The Contractor request’s the Engineer’s Assistant to confirm that, the deduction of QAR 7,400,000 made
for the removal of the demolition works as per Contract Vol 2, part 2, Cl.9.1.1.4 and the subsequent
reduction in the Contract Price shall not be repeated at the end of the project due to the duplication of
QAR 7,400,000 deduction made in the monthly Payment Certificate.

The Contractor has raised concerns to the Engineer’s Assistant in several Commercial discussions
regarding the double negative effect which will be caused at the end of the project due to the
duplication of QAR 7,400,000 deduction made in the monthly Payment Certificate in the committed cost
section as “Adjustments to Accepted Contract Amount” and also in the deductions section of payment
details as “Other Deductions” against the agreed deduction for the removal of the demolition works.

Contract Vol 2, part 2, Cl.9.1.1.4, (c) reads as below:

“The Contractor shall ensure that the first Interim Payment Certificate issued includes the agreed
deduction of QAR 7,400,000 for the removal of the demolition works and the Contract Price will be
reduced accordingly.”

On this basis, the Contractor requests the Engineer’s Assistant to confirm that, the deduction of QAR
7,400,000 from the Contract value shall not be repeated at the end of the project due to the duplication
of QAR 7,400,000 deduction made in the monthly Payment Certificate.

Yours faithfully,
