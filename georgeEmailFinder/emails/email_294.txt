Subject: Contractor's Claim: Compensation for the Employer's breach of Contract
Dear Sir,
The Contractor, pursuant to Sub-Clause 27.1.1 [Contractor's Claims] of the Conditions of Contract,
hereby submits a Contractor's claim for compensation due to a breach of Contract by the Employer.
The event or circumstance giving rise to the claim is as follows:
The Contractor refers to the Specification Section 013115 [Coordination with Tenant Areas] Article
1.5.(C), which states that: "To keep continuity within the MTB Construction Phase, the Tenant
Contractors shall use the Contractor's major subcontractors including but not limited to; all Systems {IT,
PA, Security and etc.}, Electrical, Plumbing, HVAC, and Waterproofing as based on unit rates from the
BOQ. These various subcontractors shall be directly contracted to the respective Tenant Contractors"
(emphasis added).
The Contractor has been notified by our Electrical Subcontractor, through its letter reference: (1) above,
that the electrical installation in the arcade retail circulation area was NOT carried out by our Electrical
Subcontractor. We consider this as a breach of Specification Section 013115, and as such a clear breach
of Contract by the Employer.
In view of this breach, the Contractor hereby submits our claim for compensation, which is based on the
Contractor's lost profits and lost overhead, which has been calculated based on unit rates in the BOQ
and the quantities as per our Electrical Subcontractor's proposal to carry out the electrical installation in
the arcade retail circulation area.
Yours faithfully,
