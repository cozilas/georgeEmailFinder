Notice to Correct – Lack of Material Procurement and Progress

Dear Sir,
We write with reference to our letter referenced in (2) above and further to our reminders through
emails, telecommunications whereby you have been repeatedly notified of your failure to adequately
procure materials for your Subcontract works, we hereby formally place on record our concern
regarding your ability to progress the Subcontract works expeditiously.
We take this opportunity to remind you of your obligations as set out under the Subcontract - Clause
8.1.2 [Subcontractors Obligations]. Moreover, Subcontract Clause 16.1.1 [Commencement of
Subcontract Works] provides that you are obliged to progress the Subcontract Works with due
expedition and without delay, and should neither delay nor adversely affect the performance of TCAJV
or other subcontractors.
In view of the above, you are hereby instructed pursuant to Clause 11.3 [Instructions of the Contractor]
to submit an action plan within three (3) days from the receipt of this letter, detailing your proposed
mitigation measures concerning your lack of materials on site and progress of works. It is advised that
you liaise with our Construction Team for each respective area ahead of submitting your action plan,
thus understanding all available work fronts and necessary materials and resources required.

Moreover, we bring it to your attention that, your lack of progress and materials on site has forced us to
give you this Notice to Correct, which entitles us to issue a “Seven (7) Days’ Notice to Terminate”,
according to Clause 22.2 Termination by Contractor for Subcontractor Default – sub-clauses (d), (g), (h),
(i) and (j).
22.2.2 The Contractor may, upon giving the Subcontractor seven (7) Days’ notice, terminate the
Subcontract if the Subcontractor:
(d) without reasonable excuse, fails to proceed with the Subcontract Works in accordance with clause 16
(Commencement, Delays and Suspension);
(g) persistently fails to execute the Subcontract Works in accordance with the requirements of the
Subcontract or persistently neglects to carry out and/or fulfil its obligations and/or responsibilities under
the Subcontract without due cause and the Contractor has given seven (7) Days' notice of its intention
to terminate the Subcontract unless the Subcontractor is able to satisfy the Contractor that appropriate
steps are being taken to ensure that there is no reoccurrence of such default;
(h) is in breach of any material obligation that it has under the Subcontract and the Contractor has given
seven (7) Days' notice of its intention to terminate the Subcontract unless the Subcontractor remedies
such breach to the satisfaction of the Contractor, and the Subcontractor fails or is unable to remedy
such breach to the satisfaction of the Contractor prior to the expiry of such notice;
(i) having commenced the Subcontract Works on Site is unable or fails to proceed with the Subcontract
Works with due expedition (other than as a result of Force Majeure or Contractor breach);
(j) fails to progress the Subcontract Works such that, in the opinion of the Contractor, the Subcontractor
will be unable to achieve Taking Over of the Subcontract Works in accordance with clause 18.1 (Taking
Over of the Subcontract Works and Milestones) prior to accruing delay damages (including delay
damages payable for a failure to complete a Milestone as required by the Subcontract) which would
exceed 10% of the Subcontract Price.
We also highlight that, any delays, costs, losses and/or expenses and the like incurred by us and/or
Other Sub-Contractors arising out of your lack of progress shall be solely your responsibility as per SubContract Agreement Clause 16.6.1.
We therefore issue this Notice to Correct as per Clause 22.1 and expect your positive response on the
matter within 7 (seven) days of receipt of this letter before we start taking action as per the Subcontract
clauses stated above.
This is for your immediate action and attention.
Yours faithfully,
