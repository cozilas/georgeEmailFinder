variation. The nature and extent of the variation is provided below.

To delete the requirement to provide at each switch box and crossover cavern, the smoke relief shaft
and surface structure;
•

Amend the Employer's Requirements: Volume 6, Sub-Clause 14.3.6.3 {e) as below:

"Isolation dampers {ISO}: M otorized dampers allow defining the required air-path up and downstream
of fans and inside draught relief shafts"
•
Delete the Employer's Requirements: Volume 6, Sub-Clauses 14.3.6.7 c{i), 14.3.6.7 c{ii) and
