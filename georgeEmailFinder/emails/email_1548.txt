Dear Sirs,

Further to the Contractor's initial interim Claim Nr 040 submission issued under cover of reference 2, the
Contractor confirms within this February 2016 monthly update (in accordance with General Condition
("GC")
20.1.6(b) of Volume 3 of the Contract), that no additionalinformation has been received by the
Contractor over the past month concerning the subject matter of Claim Nr 040.

However, to date, the Contractor has received no payment from the Employer with respect to Claim Nr
040. Accordingly, the Contractor provides this February 2016 Financial monthly update for Claim Nr 040
as follows.

(QAR 2,991,596.00 (Lead/Civil & MEP Designer's Direct Variation Costs) + OAR 402,615.00 (Architectura l
FOH Finishes Designer's Direct Variation Costs) = QAR 3,394,211.00.

OAR 3,394,211.00 x 13% Contractor's Overheads & Profit ("OHP") = QAR 441 ,247.00.

Finance costs to 29 February 2016 are therefore calculated as follows:
(QAR 3,394,211.00 + QAR 441,247 .00) x 6 months (27 August 2015/start of Claim Event to 29 February
2016)/ 12 months x 4.25% p.a. (Finance rate) = OAR 81,503.00.

OHP upon Finance costs = OAR 81,503 .00 x 13% (OHP rate) = OAR 10,595.00.

Therefore, total Finance Costs including OHP upon same = OAR 81,503.00 + OAR 10,595.00 = OAR
92,098.00.

This provides a February 2016 updated Financial Summary for Claim 040 as follows: FINANCIAL
