Subject:Notice of Dissatisfaction
Dear Sir,
With reference to the above subject and the enclosed email correspondences, we write to put on record
your unreasonable decision that occurred recently concerning the withholding of your services due to
payment issues for a minor amount. Please be informed that even though the issue has been resolved,
however, this is to express our dissatisfaction in how this matter has been handled by you.
Specifically, as seen in the enclosed emails you have refused to provide services due to an outstanding
amount of AED 7,180.00. For the record, please note that the amount was concerning an invoice to M/S
Bosphorus which is not related to the TCAJV and the other invoice, at the time of the enclosed
correspondence, was never received by us.
You are reminded that you have been providing your services in this project since 2013. The average
monthly payments which are being released to you, is at the value of AED 226,000.00 and the
cumulative payments to date are at the value of AED 14,079,621.00. Therefore, the fact that you have
chosen to withhold your services for the minor amount of AED 7,180.00, is totally inappropriate and
unacceptable.
In view of the above, you are kindly requested that such actions are avoided in the future to ensure the
smooth progression of the works/services. At this juncture, we reserve all of our rights derived under
the Subcontract and inform you that all necessary measures would be taken to protect our rights, in
case any similar future events occur which may lead to delays and/or costs.
This is for your information and records.
Yours faithfully,
