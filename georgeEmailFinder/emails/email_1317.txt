Moreover, regardless of the acceptance of both parties on this variation, we would like to implicate that
this does not relieve the subcontractor to all his responsibilities and obligations under the subcontract
as well as fulfilling the terms and conditions of the agreement {LOA).
Dear sir

We hereby write pursuant to the above for "Design (If any), Supply, Installation and the Rectification of
defects therein of the Duty Free Canopy Work Package" and with regards to the above mentioned
subject matter in response to your letter referenced 2) above requesting to descope GLZ-37 as well as
PPE Sockets. We hereby inform you that the request has been rejected and you are to proceed with the
execution of your Subcontract works in line with your obligations.
We further remind you of your responsibility to implement. all items priced within the Bill of Quantities
and thus forming your Scope of Works as agreed during the Tender Stage and therefore included within
the Subcontract Agreement. Additionally, it is not beneficial for us to descope certain items and source
them elsewhere as this requires time and results in additional abortive costs.
This is for your information, record and further necessary action.
Yours faithfully,
