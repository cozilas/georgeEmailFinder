Subject: Change Management Hourly Rates Breakdown & Substantiation
Dear Sir,
We write pursuant to the Subcontract and the correspondences referenced above and with rega rds to
the "Change Management Hourly Rates" subject matter. We have requested in our earlier letter
referenced (2) above to provide detailed breakdown of the rates together with adequate substantiation
indicating how they were calculated in order to prevent any delay or rejection of your invoice for
payment, but till date we have not received.
In reference to the above, now the Engineer has given us a time line for submitting all outstanding rate
breakdown with complete substantiation/supporting documents for the submitted change management
hourly rates.
To help you in resolving the above issue we are enclosing the Change Management hourly rate build-up
guideline that can be adjusted to suit your requirements. Also, please note that all pages of the
documents shall be stamped with company seal.
Please ensure that all hourly rates and substantiations are submitted within two (2) days of you
receiving this letter and failure to do so will result in AECOM determining the evaluation as zero cost.
This is for your information, record and further urgent action.
Yours faithfully,
