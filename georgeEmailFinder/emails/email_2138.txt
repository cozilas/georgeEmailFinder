2) Engineer's Assistant's Letter - M006-LBE-COM-LTR-01257.;(ated 01 September 2015

We refer to your letter reference 2) whereby you have requested the Contractor to submit a quotation
for a proposed reduction of th minimum width of the passenger walkways. Subsequent to this request
the Engineer's Instruction No. 89, reference item 1), was received to initiate and execute the reduction
as a variation.

Instructions have been issued to the designers to initiate this revision to the Employer's Requirements
and the Contractor awaits the final approved designs in order to accurately calculate any possible
variation to the Contract price.
We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification. Yours faithfully,
