Dear Sir,

The Contractor is in receipt of the Engineer’s Assistant’s letter reference 1) in response to its request in
letter reference 2) regarding the payment of outstanding amounts of Overheads, Management and
Attendance (OMA) Costs.

The Contractor cannot accept the Engineer’s Assistant’s statement that “the balance for [OMA]
following payment of all instructed pro-rata amounts, will be made at the time of completion of the
project” as this would be devastating to the Contractor’s Cashflow and, the Contractor believes, is a
misinterpretation of the Contract. The Engineer’s Assistant’s attention is drawn to the relevant excerpt
from Volume 2 sub clause 9.1.2.9 m) i) reproduced here:

“The lump sums entered for Contractor's Overheads, Management Costs and Attendances on
Provisional Sums shall be paid on a prorata basis with expenditure of the Provisional Sum. The
Contractor will receive full value of the lump sums entered regardless of any increase or decrease of the
Provisional Sum.”

The Contractor’s understanding of the foregoing is that a proportion of the fixed lump sums for OMA
shall be paid in the same proportion as the Provisional Sum is expended; in other words, the Contractor
should be receiving, for example, 25% of the lump sum for OMA related to MEP works (D.2.a, D.2.b and
D.2.c in the Volume 2 Schedules) when 25% of the MEP works corresponding to the Provisional Sum
have been executed.

Contrasting this is the fact that the although the Utility Diversions have been largely completed as
excavations draw to a close, the corresponding OMA (D.3.a, D.3.b and D.3.c) has been paid to the tune

of only QAR 3.09 Million of a total of QAR 68.36 Million, equaling only 4.5% of the total to be expended.
This is clearly not in accordance with the principle of a pro-rata expenditure of a lump sum.

The Contractor hereby makes a proposal to settle the differential amount of Overheads, Management
and Attendance (OMA) for all the Provisional Sum (PS) works progress which is certified up to IPA 32.
For the all the PS works progress till IPA 32, the Contractor has claimed 8% for OMA which is not
comparable to the OMA costs incurred by the Contractor on the PS works.

The Contractor therefore requests the Engineer’s Assistant to kindly certify the differential amount of
Overheads, Management and Attendance (OMA) for all the Provisional Sum works progress which is

certified up to IPA 32. This is conservatively estimated by the Contractor at being QAR 50.16 Million and
included in IPA 33.

Yours faithfully,
