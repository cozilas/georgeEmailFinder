Dear Sir,
The Engineer's Assistant refers to letter reference 1), wherein the Contractor was instructed to submit a
quotation for any cost or time impact. Subsequent reminders were issued, reference 2) and 3), the most
recent of which was due for reply on 14 September 2016.

The Engineer's Assistant must now conclude that the Contractor is unwilling to provide the Instructed
quotation, given that a total period of 113 days have lapsed without response or submission of the
quotation.

Due to the Contractor's failure to comply with an Engineer's instruction, the Engineer is now compelled
to procee with completing the assessment of the Variation without input from the Contractor.
Yours faithfully,
