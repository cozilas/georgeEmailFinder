Dear Sir

The Contractor has serious concerns that Mushaireb station will not be ready for the arrival and removal
back through the tunnel of the TBM.

The Contractor hereby gives notice under General Conditions, (“GC”) clause 8.3.7, an early warning of
delay. The current circumstances if not resolved urgently will adversely affect the programme and
Contract Requirements.

Yours faithfully,
