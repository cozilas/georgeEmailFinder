Subject: Notice of Delay – Completion of Hotel Building
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to the aforesaid subject matter and hereby remind you that you must complete
all your associated works in the Hotel Building by 30th May 2018. However, as per the current Progress
Report you are highly unlikely to achieve the aforesaid completion date.
In light of the above, you are hereby reminded of your obligations as set out under the Subcontract
Clause 16.6.1 which provides that:
•
“If the Subcontractor fails to comply with the approved Subcontract Programme, the
Subcontractor shall without limitation indemnify and hold the Contractor harmless against and from the
costs, losses and expenses (...) incurred by the Contractor in connection with the Subcontractor’s delays
("Contractor Delay Costs"). Contractor Delay Costs incurred by the Contractor shall be quantified by the
Contractor at the time of such losses and claimed under clause 10.3 (Subcontractor's Claims). These
costs and losses shall be recoverable by the Contractor against the Subcontractor as compensation for
the losses suffered by the Contractor as a result of the Subcontractor's delay or non-compliance with the
approved Subcontract Programme and irrespective of whether or not the Subcontractor's delay or noncompliance results in the Contractor incurring liability for delay damages to the Employer under the
Contract."
It is noted that any delays, costs, loses and/or expenses incurred by us and/or Other Subcontractor/s
arising as a result of the above delays shall be at your risk and recovered from your account in
accordance with the Subcontract clauses 10.3, 16.6.1 and other relevant clauses.
Yours faithfully,
