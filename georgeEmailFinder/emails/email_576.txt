Dispute Notice pursuant to Clause 27.3.1

Dear Sir,
In response to your letter dated 17 December 2018, we would like to comment as below.
We are very surprised to receive a formal ‘Dispute Notice’ pursuant to Clause 27.3.1 of the Conditions of
Subcontract, given the fact we have been in constant contact (in one form or another) regarding your
submitted claims, and have continued to offer support and advice against the significant shortfalls in
such claims.
In particular, during the joint workshop held at our site offices on 11 October 2018, we expressed in
detail both the discrepancies and shortcomings of your delay and disruption analyses, and your
associated costs submissions. These were acknowledged by your representatives at the time and
consequently it was agreed that you would make revised submissions. You acknowledged the

requirement to revise your claim submissions in your letters reference (2) and (3). As a result some of
those extension of time claims have only just been received by TCA JV and areis currently still under
review.
In light of this we cannot understand both the timing of and the reason for this Notice of Dispute given
the fact that you have not adequately demonstrated (from the submissions reviewed by ourselves to
date) an entitlement to an extension of Time for Completion, disruption and associated costs under the
Sub-Contract Agreement. Nevertheless, we take this Dispute Notice very seriously and would therefore
like to invite your representatives to our site office in an effort to discuss and resolve this dispute. With
this in mind we suggest the meeting takes place during week commencing 6 January 2019. Please
confirm by reply to this letter a number of available dates and times during that the proposed week, so
we can ensure the appropriate representatives from both sides are available to attend.
We look forward to your prompt response.

Yours faithfully,
