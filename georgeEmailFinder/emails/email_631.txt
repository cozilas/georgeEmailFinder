Dear Sir,

Re: Gatehouse 20 - Dismantling of buried cable duct

We are in receipt of your letter referenced (1) above where you have informed us about the excavation
works by the Employerâ€™s other Subcontractor, which are allegedly hindering your works. Please be
informed that, your letter has been forwarded to the Engineer for its review, comments and further
action.
In view of the above and in the interim you are requested to liaise with our construction team to
coordinate your works as per your Subcontract Obligations Clause 12.12 [Other Contractors and Other
Subcontractors] to work on other available work-fronts to avoid any delays.
This is for your information and further action.
Yours faithfully,
