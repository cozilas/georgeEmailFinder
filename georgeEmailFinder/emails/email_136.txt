Subject:Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic – Request for Immediate Guidance
Dear Sirs,
We refer to the rapidly developing situation regarding the Coronavirus (‘COVID-19’) that was declared a
pandemic on 11 March 2020 by the World Health Organization (‘WHO’), and which is affecting
numerous countries around the World including the UAE.
We are doing our utmost to try to cope with the pandemic in terms of the impact on this Project and
shared with you on 15 March 2020 our Infection Control Plan. For reasons beyond our control we have
no alternative other than to work in an environment that is contrary to the guidelines laid down by the
UAE Authorities and WHO. Specifically, in the case of the majority of our labour force (circa 8,000
number including subcontractors), operatives are working, eating, performing their ablutions, attending
mosques, and sleeping in close proximity to each other and are unable to maintain a ‘social distance’
(defined by WHO as 1 metre) from one another.
Furthermore, our circa 8000 labourers live in various camps in Abu Dhabi shared with another circa
140,000 labourers who work on projects all over the UAE and are not under our control. We fear that in
the event that any of these 140,000 labourers is unfortunate enough to contract the COVID-19 disease,
individual labourers from our own labour force will be exposed to the effects of the COVID-19 disease.

We fully appreciate this is an unprecedented situation, the circumstances of which are completely fluid,
largely unknown and changing daily. Whilst we are content that we took the best advice and gave due
consideration to all known circumstances in the compilation of our Infection Control Plan, we feel that it
is incumbent upon us to seek your further and immediate guidance to ensure that we are following best
practice and have not missed any opportunity to minimise the risk to the labour force, all staff working
on this Project, and to the general population of the UAE.
Members of TCAJV’s Board are ready and willing to meet with you at short notice in relation to this
urgent and critical matter and look forward to the opportunity of discussing this critical matter with you
as a matter of urgency
Yours faithfully,
