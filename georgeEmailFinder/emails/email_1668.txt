Dear Sir,

The Contractor hereby acknowledges receipt of the Engineer's Instruction No. 49 pursuant to Sub-Clause
3.3.1 of the General Conditions of the Main Contract, as received under reference 1).

It is noted that the Engineer instructed the Contractor "to implement the change of station names
required by Qatar Rail ..."

However, document lm-301-MA0 1 Rev 6.0, 12/4/ 12 which is attached to the Engineer's Instruction is a
revision of the Codification Manual containing numerous changes which are not limited to the station
names.

In this respect, the Contractor kindly requests the Engineer's confirmation as to whether the Instruction
is limited to the implementation of the station names only or to all changes contained within the
revised Codification Manual. In addition, the Engineer's confirmation is required with regards to the
applicability of the changes as of the date of the Instruction or retrospectively.

Accordingly, upon receiving this notice, the Engineer is kindly requested to cancel, confirm or vary the
Instruction.

Yours faithfully,
