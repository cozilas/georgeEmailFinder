Subject:Clause 27.1.1: Notice of Claim – Delay Notice No. 231 [post-SAA8]
Delays due to CXA request to stop the Cause & Effect testing at Pier 2 due to alleged low
standard of cleanliness issues
Dear Sirs,

It has come to our attention that on 12 March 2020, you / ADAC / Profire has requested the works
currently being carried out for the Cause & Effect (C&E) testing at Pier 2, to be stopped due to the
purported reasons explains below.
Specifically, the Employer’s Commissioning Consultant (CXA) M/s Profire, has notified us to stop and put
on hold, the C&E testing works currently being carried-out at Pier 2, due to an allegedly low standard of
cleanliness of the Fire Command Centre (FCC) and has requested that in order to restart the C&E testing
works, the following actions must be taken:
•
Cleaning of the room and Furniture;
•
Disinfectant mopping of FCC furniture;
•
Fix a Sanitizer dispenser in FCC; and
•
Fix Tissue dispenser in FCC.
In view of the above and the fact that your / Profire’s request to stop the C&E testing works and
implement the aforementioned actions, is most likely a result of the CONVID-19 (Coronavirus) impact on
the MTB Project, we therefore notify you in accordance with Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2,
and 27.1.1, of our entitlement to claim:
(i)
An extension of the Time for Completion of the Works pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.9.1(a)
‘Consequence of Suspension’, or alternatively, Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c) ‘act of prevention’;
(ii)
An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.2 pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.9
‘Consequence of Suspension’, or in the alternative, damages for breach of Contract.
In the alternative, we hereby give this notice of delay pursuant to the Clauses under 26.2 [Notice of
Force Majeure] of the General Conditions of Contract, of our entitlement to an extension of the Time for
Completion in accordance with Clause 26.1.1 (a), (b) and (c) pursuant to Clause 16.5.1 (b) (vii)
(‘Consequences of Force Majeure’).
In light of the foregoing, we kindly request you to issue an Engineer’s Instruction (EI) in respect of the
way forward to the completion of this Project, taking into consideration the actions recommended by
Profire above and also the overall impact that Coronavirus has on the Project.
Accordingly, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses
16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to the Time
for Completion and any associated costs due to the acts of prevention described herein.
Interim and/or final details of the time impacts and adjustment to the Contract Price will be provided in
due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27 .1.5{a), (b) and (c).
Meanwhile, we reiterate that we remain fully committed to you / ADAC, the Project and to completing
our obligations within the shortest possible time, without compromising on safety and quality, but will
not be held responsible for such factors as those outlined above for which we are not culpable.
Yours faithfully,
