Subject: Confirmation of Settlement for Non-Compliance of Remote Annunciator
Dear Sir
We write with reference to the above subject for your attention.
Further to our numerous discussions and meetings, we wish to record that both parties have finally
achieved an amicable settlement, whereby M/S Cummins has agreed to compensate to TCA JV with a
Lump Sum amount of AED 350,000.00 (Dirham: Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Only) towards the cost of
cabling works due to non-compliance of remote annunciator requirement, as an alternative solution in
lieu of LAN connections as per Contract Specification.
Further to your request via Email dated 17 January 2018, we hereby confirm the said amount shall be
settled against your final payment via a formal negative Variation Order which shall be issued
separately.
We hope the above clarifies the situation.
Yours faithfully,
