Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer's Assistant's letter referenced 1 above, the Contractor notes your response to
item 1 and would like to draw a distinction between requirements of Volume 4 item 12.13.2 and the
requirements of Volume 7 items 7.1.3 and 9.2. The requirements identified in Volume 7 relate solely to
the Lump Sum contract works for formwork and structural concrete and are not relevant to the issue in
question .

Volume 4 item 12.13'.2 requirements are however appropriate and relate to the production of in-situ
mock ups after the working drawing/shop drawing process has taken place, to establish workmanship
benchmarks - not as a vehicle for the approval of materials.

To facilitate progress on the issue of materials and mock up provision, the Contractor is attaching a
revised strategy document along with a narrative outlining the sequence for Material Approvalfor the
Provisional Sums front of House materials, with the addition of a section covering the expected in-situ

back of House samples and mock-ups. These documents are produced in order to start the dialogue in
regards to the provision of mock-ups for provisional sums works and agree with the Engineer/QR the
basis for further development of the mock-ups and the programme for such works. Upon agreement of
the extent of the mock-ups to be provided the Contractor will be better placed to provide a detailed
programme for each of the items required.

The Contractor would note that in the meeting held on the 171h June 2015 that the Underground
Station Mock- up Scope issued by Qatar Rail under letter reference 5 is now cancelled and as such we
are no longer required to submit a proposal for the implementation of this scope of work.
Yours faithfully,
