Subject:Clause 27.1.1: Notice of Claim – Delay Notice No. 231 [post-SAA8]
Delays due to ADAC / Profire Ordering the ‘Hold’ of Cause & Effect Testing at Pier 2 due to
cleanliness issues consequent on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic
Dear Sirs,
We refer to our letter ref: (1) notifying you the ramification of the epidemic levels of the Coronavirus
(COVID-19) which has rapidly become a pandemic effecting numerous countries around the World.
On or about 12 March 2020, ADAC / CMA / Profire ordered us to stop the Cause & Effect (C&E) Testing
at Pier 2, due to purported cleanliness issues of the Fire Command Centre (FCC) which we know to be
fuelled by the prevailing Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We have been advised that in order for the
stop order to be lifted and in order to restart the C&E testing works, the following actions must be
taken:
•
Cleaning of the room and Furniture;
•
Disinfectant mopping of FCC furniture;
•
Fix a Sanitizer dispenser in FCC; and
•
Fix Tissue dispenser in FCC.
In view of the above and the fact that ADAC / CMA / Profire’s request to ‘stop’ the C&E Testing is for all
intents tantamount to a ‘Suspension Notice, then we hereby notify you in accordance with Conditions of
Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2, and 27.1.1, of our entitlement to claim:
(i)
An extension of the Time for Completion of the Works pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.9.1(a)
‘Consequence of Suspension’, or alternatively, Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c) ‘act of prevention’; and
(ii)
An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.2 pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.9
‘Consequence of Suspension’, or in the alternative, damages for breach of Contract.
In the alternative, on this basis this is an epidemic, we hereby notify you pursuant to Conditions of
Contract Sub-Clause 26.2 of our entitlement to an extension of the Time for Completion in accordance
with Clause 26.1.1 (a), (b) and (c) pursuant to Clause 16.5.1 (b) (vii) (‘Consequences of Force Majeure’).
In light of the prevailing situation in the UAE, we kindly request you to issue us an instruction on the way
forward taking into consideration the actions recommended by Profire above and more significantly the
overall impact that the ramifications of COVID-19 is likely to have to the completion of the Project.
Meanwhile, we reiterate that we remain fully committed to you / ADAC, the Project and to completing
our obligations within the shortest possible time, without compromising on safety and quality, but will
not be held responsible for such factors as those outlined above for which we are not culpable.
Accordingly, interim and/or final details of the associated time impacts and adjustment to the Contract
Price will be provided in due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.5 (a), (b) and (c).
Yours faithfully,
