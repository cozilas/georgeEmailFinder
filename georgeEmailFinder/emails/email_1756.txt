Dear Sir,

The Contractor has raised concerns to the Engineer’s Assistant in several Commercial discussions
regarding the double negative effect which is caused on the Contract price due to the duplication of
QAR 7,400,000 deduction made in the monthly Payment Certificate in the committed cost section as
“Adjustments to Accepted Contract Amount” and also in the deductions section of payment details as
“Other Deductions” against the agreed deduction for the removal of the demolition works from the
Contract Price.

Contract Vol 2, part 2, Clause.9.1.1.4, (c) reads as below:

“The Contractor shall ensure that the first Interim Payment Certificate issued includes the agreed
deduction of QAR 7,400,000 for the removal of the demolition works and the Contract Price will be
reduced accordingly.”

With reference to Contract Vol 2, part 2, Clause.9.1.1.4, (c), the Contractor understands that, the
deduction of QAR 7,400,000 shall be made from the Contract Price against the removal of the
demolition works as these works were carried out by some other Subcontractor.

The Contractor fails to understand the reduction QAR 7,400,000 in the Contract Price as well as the
deduction of QAR 7,400,000 from payment certificate no.3 made by the Engineer’s Assistant.

The Contractor believes that QAR 7,400,000 against the removal of the demolition works are wrongly
deducted from the Payment Amount and requests the Engineer’s Assistant to revert back the same in
the forthcoming payment certificate.

Yours faithfully,
