Subject: Alleged Disrupted MV Cable Pulling Works
Dear Sir,

We acknowledge receipt of your Letter Reference MTB-ANEL-TCA-L-1897 dated 91h July 2015 on the
subject matter and would respond as follows to the allegations made within.
We have carried out an internal review of your allegations I version of events with our on-site HSE Team
and would clarify for the record that we do not agree with your bias I inaccurate record of the same.
We confirm that preparation works associated with the MV Cabling Works commenced shortly after
6.00am on the morning of 9th July 2015. Our Site Safety Representative was contacted by your MV
Cabling
Subcontractor (RANYA) at 7.20am and promptly arrived at the required location at 7.30am. We were
requested to authorise the permit to work documentation and after checking the content of the same
and obtaining clarification as to the requirement of ADDC approved certification the document was
signed off. The entire procedure was carried out within a 30 minute timeframe.
We refute in its entirety your spurious allegation I claim that circa 2 Y2 hrs were lost due to downtime I
idle time in this regard. Your claim is completely baseless and without substantiation I credence in any
shape or form. We would respectively request that you concentrate your efforts on more pertinent
issues on the project as correspondences on such menial matters are not conclusive to that of a pro
active approach.
If you seek further clarification to any of the points raised within, please do not hesitate to contact the
undersigned.
Yours faithfully,
