Subject: Risk Committee Meetings - notes
Dear Sirs,
We refer to your ongoing issuing of observations made from the above meetings under the title
'Minutes of Meeting'. We also refer to the closing 'Note' on these documents that assumes passive
acceptance these observations if there are no 'adverse comments' received within 48 hours of the
issue of the observations.
Given the document is normally issued either late on a Thursday or during the weekend it is not
possible for us to correct any incomplete or as we see it incorrect statement within your deadline.
Whilst it cannot be said to be minutes of the meeting we are content to treat this document as a
record of agreed action points but require that any corrections raised by us at are recorded in the

document issued in respect of the next meeting.
As discussed at today's meeting we request that the following amendments are made to the
document issued in respect of the meeting dated 21 April 2019:
Item 4- Action is by Aecom. We have provided further substantiation of our position in respect of
AI Ghurair;
Item 5- Action is by ADAC & Aecom.
Item 6- Action is by Aecom. This is a Variation for which we are awaiting a fully detailed Engineer's
Instruction that we can then treat under Clause 2.29 of SAA8.
Yours faithfully
