Subject FWD: Non-Conformance Report reference MTC-CMA-0401-CM-NCR-00845
Dear Sir,
Further to letter reference (1) which set forth the Contractor's objection to the Engineer's refusal to
close out
Non-Objection Report No. 845 (NCR-845), please find attached letter reference (2) wherein the
specialist
cladding Subcontractor Chadwick Technology LLC also responds to the comments made by the Engineer
on
NCR-845.
The Subcontractor concurs with the Contractor that the Engineer shall neither withhold nor refuse to
close
out a non-conformance on the basis of a separate material submittal. The Engineer shall proceed to
close out
the non-conformance upon identification of the root cause of failure and subsequent confirmation of
the
proposed remedial measures.
The Engineer is therefore politely requested to take into consideration the comments made by the
Subcontractor in its letter (2) and proceed with the closure of NCR-845.
Yours faithfully,
