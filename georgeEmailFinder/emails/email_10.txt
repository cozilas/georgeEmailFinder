Contra-charges for Surveyorâ€™s Incorrect Setting-out

Dear Sir,
With reference to the report received from our SWRO Plant Project in Jebel Ali, it was reported by our
management team on-site, that incorrect marks have been provided for the opening on the parapet wall
GL 1-1 by your surveyor.

As a consequence of the incorrect setting-out by your surveyor, we are now forced to take rectification
measures to break and re-construct the wall and the opening of the parapet wall GL 1-1, as indicated in
Figure 1 below.

Please note that this has also greatly delayed our site progress and productivity which will require the
equivalent time and effort to correct the damages that has been done.
Therefore, please be informed that the cost for all rectification works such as breaking the concrete,
cutting the reinforcement and placing a new one, and repairing the broken edges, shall be recorded and
deducted from your monthly invoice.
We trust you find the aforementioned self-explanatory, and appropriate steps will be taken, in order to
avoid reoccurrence of such events in the future.
Yours faithfully,
