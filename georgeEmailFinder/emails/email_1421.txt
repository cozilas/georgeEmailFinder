Dear Sir,

We refer to discussions held during the meeting referenced 1 above regarding the proposed increase in
depth of the emergency exit shaft at Al Sharq.

This proposed increase in depth and the associated design development is the most recent event
affecting the design and construction of the emergency exit shaft; detailed particulars of the preceding
event (Traction Power Supply) can be found in the Contractor's Interim Claim Submission No. 021 (the
"Claim"), dated 27 May 2015, which is currently under review by the Engineer's Assistant.

The Contractor asserts that, as a consequence of the delay event included in the Claim, Key Interface
Date No. 7 ("STKID.07") due for completion on 31 August 2015 cannot be achieved. The proposed
increase in depth would further impact STKID.07.

The Contractor wishes to advise that a revised date for the completion of STKID.07 cannot be
ascertained until the design has been finalised, which is only possible once all the Employer 's
requirements are known and incorporated into the design.

In consideration of the above, the Contractor proposes that STKID.07 be suspended until such time as a
revised date can be established. Alternatively, the Contractor proposes that an interim extension to the
STKID.07 Time for Completion of 217 calendar days be awarded , revising the Time for Completion to 4
April 2016, on the basis of the detailed particulars included in the Claim.

The Contractor welcomes the opportunity to discuss this matter further .
Yours faithfully,
