Dear Sir,

The Engineer's Assistant refers to letter reference 6), wherein the Contractor's final paragraph notes the
quotation to be 'The interim adjustment of the Contract Price...', where the Contractor further notes
'The Contractor reserves its right to recover any time related costs in connection to this Variation which
shall be addressed under separate cover'.
The Engineer's direction under letter reference 1) and indeed Sub-Clause 13.2 'Proposed Variations'
does not contemplate submission of 'interim adjustment to the Contract Price' as provided in Contractor
letter reference 6).
The Contractor is required to provide the complete Variation quotation as directed under letter
reference 1), to include any time related costs the Contractor considers relevant.

The Con ractor is also required to confirm that the quotation under Sub-Clause 13.2.2 is comprehensive,
such that upon the Engineer's agreement , the Contractor's claim number 40 will be withdrawn.
Yours faithfully,
