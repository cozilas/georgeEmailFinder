FWD: Recording of Material Submittal – Aluminium Composite Panel Skin

Dear Sir,
Please find attached letter reference (1) wherein the specialist cladding Subcontractor Chadwick
Technology LLC records its objection to the Engineer’s recent action, where the material submittal

reference (3), previously granted a status code 2 on 20 June 2017, was being downgraded to code 3 on
18 December 2017 citing failure to provide the required certificates/tests on time.
The Contractor endorses the Subcontractor’s disapproval and requests the Engineer reviews and
approves the re-submission of the material submittal (2) which includes all relevant certifications.
Yours faithfully,
