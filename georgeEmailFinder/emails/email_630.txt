Service Provider’s General Obligations - Progress Report

Dear Sir,
With reference to the above subject, this is to inform you that to date we have not received any
progress reports as per the Service Provider’s General Obligations, required under the Service
Agreement.
You are therefore instructed pursuant to your Scope of Works defined in the Service Agreement

This is for your information and further immediate action.
Yours faithfully,
