Subject:Reply – VO Proposal for Bal-01 change in the thickness of Aluminium panel from 4mm to 5mm
Dear Sir,
We acknowledge receipt of your letter referenced in (4) above regarding the aforementioned subject.
Unfortunately, we hereby confirm that BAL-01 is fully a performance item therefore any change/
increase in the elements dimensions/thickness to achieve the structural performance is under the
Subcontractor’s responsibility, who is a specialist in this area.
Therefore, kindly refer to the enclosed Specification 055213 which state:
•
Clause 1.: Contractor is responsible for the design of metal railings and related elements,
including interfaces and coordination with work of adjoining trades, to satisfy the aesthetic effects
and performance requirements in accordance with the Contract Documents.
•
Clause 2: The Specification together with the Drawings establish requirements for aesthetic
effects and performance requirements. As scope and performance documents, the Drawings and
Specifications do not necessarily indicate or describe in detail all work required for the full performance
and completion of the Works. Contractor is responsible for developing and completing the design in
accordance with the Contract Documents, and shall provide all items required for proper completion of
the Works without adjustment to the Contract price.
In light of the above, you are kindly informed of our rejection of your VO Proposal and inform you to
refrain from submitting such notifications in the future.
This is for your information and record.
Yours faithfully,
