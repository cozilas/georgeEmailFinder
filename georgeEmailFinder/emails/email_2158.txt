Dear Sir,

Engineer's Assistant refers to letter referenced above wherein Contractor was requested to
submit a quotation for any cost and time impact. Contractor's response was due by 7 April 2016.
Contractor has failed to submit the quotation. This is a reminder of the obligation pursuant to SubClause
13.2.1 to submit the quotation within time specified.

Failure to respond within five (5) days of receipt of this reminder will lead the Engineer's Assistant to
consider further
tion.

Yours faithfully,
