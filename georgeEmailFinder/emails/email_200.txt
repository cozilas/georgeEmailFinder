Subject:Post SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0208
Late & Unreasonable Status Code 3 Comments on Shop Drawing Introducing Additional Aircraft Contact
Detectors to Passenger Boarding Bridges (PBBs)
Dear Sirs,
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
The matters described in Annex A concern delays to the Works due to the late and unreasonable Status
Code 3 comments issued in response to Shop Drawing No: 401-TH-S-03-10-0.00-GA-SD-010 Rev 02,
introducing additional Aircraft Contact Detectors to the PBBs (i.e. representing a change in design and
scope); requiring a valid EI and VO in order for us to integrate the same into the Works.
Potential Impact
Delays and disruption due to the events and circumstances outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
likely to impact on the achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delays and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned immediately upon receipt of this e-notice.

Nevertheless, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
On 12 December 2019 we submitted Shop Drawing Submittal No. SDS/0401/S/1306-05 requesting the
final approval of Shop Drawing No: 401-TH-S-03-10-0.00-GA-SD-010 Rev. 02, for the Passenger
Boarding/Link Bridge (PBB) ‘General Drawing’, in the manner shown in Table 1 below.

Article 1.3 of Specification Section 013300 ‘Submittal Procedures’ governs the processing time by which
you are contractually obligated to respond to our Submittals. On the basis that our Submittal is at Rev.
05, then this ought to have been responded to by you 7 calendar days later, i.e. on 19 December 2019.
However, Table 1 shows that you exceeded the contract review periods by 32 calendar days. Any delay
to our submittals, is unacceptable, particularly at this stage of the Project.
Notwithstanding, we further records that you returned the attached Shop Drawing classified as Status
Code 3; the primary basis of which is reflected by the following [unreasonable] comments:
“Note: When will the PBB stop? After the first detector hits the aircraft fuselage or when the second
detector does? If possible provide 3 detectors. The PBB will stop when 2 of 3 detectors will touch
fuselage. Otherwise fuselage damage will be possible!” [Refer to Figure 1]
Figure 1
In light of the fact that the entire PBB bridge together with all its parts and components including the
Aircraft Contact Detectors (ACD), are factory-made and assembled by the manufacturer in Spain as a
single composite unit and are delivered to the site ready and are fit for purpose and moreover satisfy
the performance requirements for which they are intended in the Contract, and more significantly, have
already been approved, we consider your Code 3 comments unreasonable and without merit.
Therefore, for the reasons outlined above and further explained below, it is our contention that these
comments [and hence the Status Code 3 rejection of Shopdrawing ref: 401-TH-S-03-10-0.00-GA-SD-010Rev 02] is not only unreasonable but totally unfounded. This is despite the PBBs (and the ACDs) being
compliant with the Contract, their intended purpose and are up to the industry’s codes and standards,
after having been assembled, tested, delivered and handed over to you through the Work Inspection
Requests (WIR) and Commissioning Inspection Requests (CIR) processes.
Notably, the previous revision to Shop Drawing No: 401-TH-S-03-10-0.00-GA-SD-010, i.e. Rev. 01 had
already been approved by you with Code 2 comments via your response to SDS/0401/S/1306-03
received by us on 29 January 2014 (Figure 2 refers). Nevertheless, the shopdrawing was resubmitted
after correcting a drafting error thereupon, in regards to the ‘Autoleveler Buzzer’ on the Passenger
Boarding Bridge cabin. Accordingly, our Shop Drawing was re-submitted for information purposes and
not necessarily to seek any approval or recoding, since it had already been approved with Code 2.

No: 401-TH-S-03-10-0.00-GA-SD-010-Rev01 (issued vide SDS/0401/S/1306-03)

We further record that not only did you return our Shop Drawing No: 401-TH-S-03-10-0.00-GA-SD-010Rev 01 with Status Code 2 [“Exemptions as Noted, Revise and Resubmit for Record”] as stated above,
but it is also worth mentioning that no reference is made nor any comments are annotated thereupon
concerning the ACDs installed on PBBs. For clarity and the avoidance of doubt your comments to
SDS/0401/S/1306-03 received on 29 January 2014, are reproduced in Figure 3 below.
Figure 3
This demonstrates to us that you had every opportunity to raise any concerns you might have had on
Aircraft Contact Detectors six years ago, i.e. in 2014; but you failed to do so. It is also noteworthy that
your team had also undertaken numerous inspections and conducted functional tests on a mock-up PBB
unit, prior to manufacturing in Spain, and no comments were made during any of the inspections either
in relation to the requirement for additional ACDs. We further record the Contract Documents including
without limitation the PBB Specification do not provide any information or any references whatsoever in
support of any requirement to install 3 Nos of ACDs to the PBBs as per your Code 3 comments issued in
response to the Shop Drawing submitted via SDS/0401/S/1306-05.
Consequently, if you had any concern on the number of ACDs, or you wished to instigate changes to the
ACDs and the PBBs, then you had every opportunity in advising us prior to releasing and approving (with
Code 2), your response to SDS/0401/S/1306-03 on 24 January 2014 and most importantly prior to the
manufacturing and delivery of the PBBs from the manufacturer/supplier.
In light of the foregoing, we are appreciably perturbed to now be informed – albeit surreptitiously
through comments annotated on a Shop Drawing – that you require changes to the ACDs installed on
the PBBs; rather than formally, as is normally the case, by issuing us revised IFC Drawings and an EI.
In view of the circumstances summarised above, your comments are not only mistimed, but
unreasonable and without merit. You have also failed to take cognisance of the ramifications on the
project if you insist on instigating any changes – particularly at such a late stage of the Project.
Consequently, we record that your comments affect all PBBs installed in the Project. This is
notwithstanding the immense amount of disruption that would be caused to the completed works.
Therefore, in order for us to undertake and instigate changes such as those noted herein, we will require
fully coordinated revised IFC Drawings encapsulating the changes introduced in your SDS response
before we consider acting on any proposed changes. In which respect, we remind you yet again that
SAA8 laid down mandatory procedures to be followed if additional works are required, in so far as an EI
and VO are required first for us to proceed with any of the aforementioned changes.
The provisions of Clauses 2.29 to 2.31 of SAA8’ pertaining to Variations are clear; we are not to proceed
with any Variation unless a Variation Order and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. In which
respect, it is your obligation to issue this Record first if you wish to instigate change; this is only after the
additional time and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.
Therefore, until such time as you take the action required of you in accordance with SAA8 Clause 2.29,
we are unable to proceed with implementing the changes noted above and will continue to proceed in
accordance with the existing IFC design to the extent we are able to.
Meanwhile, given the unreasonable nature of your Status Code 3 comments issued in response to
SDS/0401/S/1306-05, we request that you immediately re-code it to a minimum of Status Code 2.
Yours faithfully,
