Dear Sir,

The Contractor acknowledges receipt of Document Review Sheet (DRS) reference 1) on the 191h of April
2015. The (DRS) purports that, per Contract Volume 2 (Form of Proposal) Sub Clause 9.1.2.5 (f) ii D, the
design of the utility diversions falls under the scope of Lump Sum.

Per Contract Volume 5 (Employer's Requirements), Sub Clause 7.5.1 (Provisional Sums for Utility
Diversions) the design of the utility diversion falls under the scope of Provisional Sums.

Per Contract Volume 3 (Conditions of Contract), Sub Clause 1.6 (Priority of Documents), Volume 5
(Employer's Requirements) prevails over Volume 2 (Form of Proposal).

Accordingly, it is the Contractor's position that this and any future design work related to utility
diversions are to henceforth be considered forming part of the Provisional Sums' scope.

Yours faithfully,
