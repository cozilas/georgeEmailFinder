Subject: Briefing Packs Change Management Team
Dear Sir,
The Contractor confirms receipt of Engineer's letter ref (1) and once again records its disappointment
with
the contents therein.
The Engineer has stated in letter ref (1) that "The Engineers position remains that only the personnel
instructed through the relevant Engineer's Instructions are compensable by way of timesheet approval."
In
response to this statement, the Contractor directs the Engineer to Engineer's Instruction (EI) no 323
which
only states that "You are hereby instructed, pursuant to Clause 20.1.1 (a) of the Conditions of Contract_
to
appoint and implement competent and sufficient resources to address the completion of all design
items .... . " (emphasis added).
The Engineer's instruction does not clearly define which personnel are instructed to be utilised but
merely
states that competent and sufficient resources are to be implemented. Following receipt of El no 323,
the
Contractor complied with the instruction and ensured that competent and sufficient resources were
deployed to assist the Employer's Design Consultants in concluding the design.
Furthermore, the Engineer will acknowledge that usually during any design development process (which
the briefing pack process ultimately was); the presence of commercial and planning resources would
always be required . The Engineer issued the agreed briefing pack I design information development
process via letter ref (7) which stated that "Commercial team[s] to be involved [n the Change Team
Management reviews." Therefore, it is clearly evident from this statement that the Engineer understood
and acknowledged that, commercial and planning resources would be required, as part of the briefing
pack process.
Therefore based on the foregoing, the Contractor once again asserts that the Contractor having
complied
with the instruction of the Engineer is now being deprived of its entitlement under the Contract. The
Contractor, pursuant to clause 11.4, therefore insists that the Engineer assess the final value of the
Variation Order in a fair manner, taking into account all relevant circumstances but paying particular
regard to the non-obligation of the Contractor under the Contract in relation to assisting the Employer
to
complete its design.
