Dear Sir,

Further to the letter of reference 3) and the Engineer’s Instructions of references 8) and 9) issued
pursuant to General Condition (“GC”) 13.1.1 of Volume 3 of the Contract, the Contractor encloses
herewith full particulars in relation to the abortive and / or additional design works pursuant to its GC
13.2.2 obligations.

The evaluation of abortive design costs of attachment 1) enclosed herewith supersedes the Contractor’s
previous submissions for the same. Importantly, the Contractor no longer relies upon the actual costs
brought forward by M/s Atkins and its respective determinations but on the same principle put forward
by the Engineer’s Assistant via letter reference 6) in quantifying the abortive design costs in relation to
the cross-passages.

Similarly to the change in cross passage spacing requirements, fact is that prior to the receipt of the
Engineer’s Instructions of letter references 8) and 9) the Contractor had already progressed with its
passageways DD1 and DD2 design submissions pursuant to the Employer’s Requirements of Volume 6 of
the Main Contract.

The Contractor has enclosed in attachment 2) all relevant proof (in the manner requested by the
Engineer’s Assistant via letter reference 3) comprising of the relevant design transmittals that were
submitted to the DVE prior to the receipt of the Engineer’s Instructions of letter references 8) and 9), in
effect, a comprehensive ‘list of deliverables’ which form the basis of the Contractor’s entitlement.

On the basis of the Engineer’s Assistant pricing methodology therefore, the Contractor has evaluated in
attachment 1) to this letter the abortive design costs which have been summarized in table 1) below.
The relevant head of claims by Atkins (FCN 071) have also been included for information only, so as to
enable a direct comparison of the amounts involved.
