Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to the Engineer's Assistant's ("EA") letter at reference 1 (received by the
Contractor on 04 February 2016) in which the EA insists, contrary to the Contractor's opinion stated
within reference 2, that the Contractor's contractual obligations preclude the provision of MEP plant
rooms within the Entrance Shelters at ground level and that such rooms should be relocated below
ground.

Moreover, the EA has not issued/arranged for the issue of a formal Engineer's Variation Instruction
covering the required relocation of the said MEP plant rooms contrary to the Contractor's request within
reference 2.

The Contractor is therefore of the opinion that the EA's aforementioned insistence within reference 1 to
relocate the MEP plant rooms below ground, which has been made with the Employer's full knowledge
and lack of objection to same, is an Engineer's Instruction issued pursuant to General Condition ("GC")
3.3.1 of Volume 3 of the Contract, with the Employer's Authority pursuant to GC 3.1.4(b). The
Contractor is also of the view that this Engineer's Instruction constitutes a Variation under GC 13.

The Contractor is of the opinion that this Engineer's Instruction may provide the Contractor with
entitlement for additional payment for the resulting varied Works as an addition to the Contract Price
pursuant to GC 13.6.1 and may provide the Contractor with entitlement to receive extension(s) to the
affected Time(s) for Completion pursuant to GC 8.4.1(a) for any delays consequently incurred due to
executing the varied Works.

Accordingly, the Contractor hereby notifies the Engineer's Assistant of the Contractor's intention to
claim for its entitlement (1) for additional payment due to the aforementioned Engineer's Instruction
(notification pursuant to GC 3.3.4 and GC 20.1.2) and, (2) for any extensions to the affected Time(s) for
Completion for any delays that may be incurred due to the aforementioned Engineer's Instruction
(notification pursuant to GC 3.3.4, GC 8.4.2 and GC 20.1.2).

Please rest assured however that notwithstanding the above, the Contractor will endeavour, in
accordance with its contractual obligations, to mitigate any delays and additional costs incurred due to
the alleged Engineer's Instruction.

Yours faithfully,
