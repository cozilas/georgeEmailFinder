Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer’s Instruction Nr.78 of reference 9) issued pursuant to General Condition (“GC”)
13.1.1 of Volume 3 of the Contract, the Contractor encloses herewith full particulars of its actual design
costs incurred to this date in relation to the integration of pop-ups within the urban environment
adjacent to the Joaan Station.

As a direct consequence of the aforesaid instruction to vary the works, the Contractor instructed Atkins
to perform additional work and has received a notice for additional payment by Atkins on account of the
additional design works entailed. Those can be summarized as per the following table:

FCN 114

Table 1) FCN114: Amounts claimed by Atkins, ALYSJ JV Determination for the same and payments to
date

As detailed herein, the Contractor estimates that QAR 244,211.18 is a fair and reasonable compensation
to Atkins against the originally claimed value of QAR 699,681.00 which was, at the Contractor’s opinion,
overstated both in terms of the applicable staff rates and the respective time spent.

The Contractor has enclosed as attachments 1) and 2) to this letter respectively both its determination
of FCN 114 and the respective notice for additional payment as received by Atkins.

Whilst noting that none of its aforementioned determination amounts have been agreed with Atkins as
full and sole compensation with the entire balance being the subject of an ongoing dispute, the

Contractor has nevertheless paid the amount of QAR 244,211.18 already, for which, proof of payment in
the form of electronic payment (wire transfer) documents has been enclosed as attachment 3).

It is further noted that the said FCN along with its respective determination and the design changes
themselves occurred circa six (6) months prior to the receipt of the Engineer’s subsequent instructions
of letter references 2) and 3) on the same subject, which were only received by the Contractor few
weeks ago.

Further re-design costs on account of the Joaan station pop-ups should therefore be reasonably
expected by the Engineer. The Contractor shall notify the Engineer following receipt of the relevant
particulars from its design consultants and its subsequent determination of a fair and reasonable
compensation for the same.

In any event, and whilst noting that the FCN 114 determination amount may be subject to further
change, the Contractor kindly requests the Employer to proceed with an interim, on-account payment of
its actual design costs incurred plus 12% for profits and overheads, in the net amount of QAR
273,516.52.

Such payment would be of invaluable assistance to the continued financing of the Project.

Yours faithfully,
