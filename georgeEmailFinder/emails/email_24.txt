Dear Sir,
We acknowledge receipt of your letter referenced in (3) above regarding the subject matter.
We have observed that you failed to specifically identify the party who damaged your purported
completed works. However as per your evidence provided, it clearly indicates that the works were
inadequately protected or even not protected at all.

In light of the above, you are hereby reminded of your obligation under the Subcontract to protect your
works until such a time as ownership of the same transfers to the Employer upon TOC and below are the
applicable relevant clauses;
•
Clause 15.6.2 - 'the Subcontractor shall remain responsible for the care, custody, safekeeping
and protection of each part of the Subcontract Works until such time as the Contractor issues the Taking
over Certificate at Substantial Completion.
Additionally, the provisions of clause 24.2 (Subcontractor's Care of the Subcontract Works) shall apply;
•
Clause 24.2.1 - ‘Schedule 22 (General Requirements and Attendances), the Subcontractor shall
take full responsibility for the care of the Subcontract Works and Goods from the Commencement Date
until the Taking over Certificate in respect of Substantial Completion is issued, when responsibility for
the care of the whole of the Subcontract Works shall pass to the Contractor.... '
•
Clause 24.2.2 - 'Subcontractor is responsible for their care, from any cause not listed in clause
24.3 (Contractor's Risks), the Subcontractor shall rectify the loss or damage at the Subcontractor's risk
and cost. So that the Subcontract Works, Goods and Subcontractor's Documents conform with the
Subcontract.... '
In case you wish to pursue a claim against another Subcontractor, the onus is on you to provide correct
particulars in the form of substantiation/ evidence of the damage for our assessment and to inform the
parties involved accordingly.
Yours faithfully,
