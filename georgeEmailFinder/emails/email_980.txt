Subject: Payment for Commissioning Works- TCA JV's Comment
Dear Sir,
We acknowledge receipt of the above Invoice and we would comment as follows.
Please be informed we have certified your payment in relation to Commissioning Works for Room 7 to
10
with a total of 395 hours (see enclosed email). Subsequently, the Supervision for Installation works have
been agreed to be excluded as per our meeting dated 09 January 2018 accordingly.
Nevertheless, we have received additional Invoice from you with ref: DB 900150 dated 27 Jan 2018 (see
enclosed Invoice) claiming for extra cost on top of the abovementioned 395 hours (see enclosed
Invoice).
We would remind you that the daily rate for Commissioning Works of AED 4,400/Day (see enclosed
Agreement) is subject to a limit as indicated in the LPO (see enclosed LPO), whereby we have allowed a

limit of approximate 10 hours for you to complete the commissioning works in each room, we consider
M/S Cummins, as a specialist in the industry has the ability to plan and achieve the said target
accordingly.
Consequently, we regret to inform you that we are unable to accept any claim beyond this limit and the
above Invoice with the amount of AED 36,960 is hereby rejected.
Whilst writing, we would request you to obtain an access card from our HR Department for each of your
Commissioning staff in order to enable our assessment inline with your daily rate claim as per our
Agreement. We believe this shall benefit both parties to avoid any future dispute in this regard.
Should you have queries, please do not hesitate to discuss further.
Yours faithfully,
