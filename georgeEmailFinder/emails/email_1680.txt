Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer’s Instruction Nr.96 of reference 2) issued pursuant to General Condition (“GC”)
13.1.1 of Volume 3 of the Contract, the Contractor encloses herewith full particulars of its actual design
costs related to the amendment of the remote entry at Doha Zoo Station.

As a direct consequence of this instruction to vary the works, the Contractor instructed Atkins to
perform additional work and has received a notice for additional payment by Atkins on account of the
additional design works entailed. Those can be summarized as per the following table:

FCN 101

Amount claimed by Atkins

Table 1) FCN101: Amounts claimed by Atkins, ALYSJ JV Determination for the same and payments to
date

As detailed herein, the Contractor estimates that QAR 148,872.33 is a fair and reasonable compensation
to Atkins against the originally claimed value of QAR 317,047.28 which was, at the Contractor’s opinion,
overstated both in terms of the applicable staff rates and the respective time spent.

The Contractor has enclosed as attachment 1) to this letter its determination of FCN 101.

Whilst noting that none of its aforementioned determination amounts have been agreed with Atkins as
full and sole compensation with the entire balance being the subject of an ongoing dispute, the
Contractor has nevertheless paid the amount of QAR 148,872.33 already, for which, proof of payment in
the form of electronic payment (wire transfer) documents has been enclosed as attachment 2).

In any event, and whilst noting that the FCN 101 determination amount may be subject to further
change, the Contractor kindly requests the Employer to proceed with an interim, on-account payment of
its actual design costs incurred plus 12% for profits and overheads, in the net amount of QAR
166,737.01.

Such payment would be of invaluable assistance to the continued financing of the Project.

Yours faithfully,
