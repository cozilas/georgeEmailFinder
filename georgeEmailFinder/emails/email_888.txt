Re: Delay Notice – Delaying the MEP 3rd Fix

Dear Sir,
With reference to the above subject and in continuation to our letter referenced (1) above we hereby
respond to your letter reference (2) above regarding the delays in the MEP 3rd fix.
Please note that we acknowledge the fact that the ceiling painting works is under our scope, however, it
is your failure to complete the taping and jointing of the ceiling that has caused the delays. This is due to
the fact that in order for us to proceed with the ceiling coating, it requires the aforementioned activities
to be completed. Therefore, since the taping and jointing of the ceiling have not been completed we
have been unable to proceed with the ceiling coating and subsequent fixing of the MEP 3rd fix.
Moreover, in regards to your statement that “MEP did not give M/s Cloisall the required clearances to
close the ceiling”, please be informed that you have an obligation under the Subcontract to follow our
instructions respectively, hence when you receive a confirmation/instruction to proceed with ceiling
closure, you have a duty to comply correspondingly, which will subsequently enable us to complete the
MEP works above the ceiling, accordingly.
In response to your statement that you are holding the works in the absence of the issuance of the
pending Variation Order for the GYB-04 Fire rated ceilings, your refusal and failure to proceed with the
works as per our instruction is unacceptable. Please be informed that it is your contractual obligation to
proceed with the Contractor’s Instruction expeditiously and without delay, pursuant to Clause 11.3
[Instructions of the Contract] of the Subcontract Agreement.
This is for your information and necessary urgent action.

Yours faithfully,
