Table 1) Summary of Valuation

The deletion of smoke shafts is a result of MSl's TVS design development. Along with the deletion of the
smoke shafts MSI introduced new jet fan niche requirements for the Al Sudan and Sport City
switchboxes and

ALYSJ
joint venture

relocated one set of jet fans in the Bin Mahmoud switchbox. This design development is clearly shown in
the revision 1 of the respective ICD's when compared to their revision 0, all enclosed to this letter in
attachment 4).

At the time of the Instruction reference 4) the construction of the smoke shaft at the Bin Mahmoud
switchbox had no option but to continue as the late design change would have directly impacted the
programme. Therefore no cost saving has been considered in relation to the aforement ioned smoke
shaft. This smoke shaft forms an integral part of the emergency exit structure and its final design is
currently being developed.

The interim adjustment of the Contract Price is of the net amount of QAR 1,981,405.54 . The Contractor
reserves its rights to recover any time related costs in connectio n to this Variation which shall be
addressed under a separate cover.

Yours faithfully,
