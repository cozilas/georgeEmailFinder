Dear Sir,
Further to the Engineer’s Instructions references 1) and 2) issued under GC 13.1.1 the Contractor
herewith provides full particulars of the time and cost impact under his GC 13.2.1 obligations, relating to
the change to the Employer’s Requirements concerning the Environmental Design Criteria and the
Drainage Design Specifications.

The impact on the design of the Entrances is summarized in a presentation to the Engineer held in April
2016 and enclosed in attachment 1) to this letter.

The Designer has therefore has raised FCN 103 to cover his additional design efforts related to
Instruction reference 2), enclosed as attachment 2) to this later. The determination of FCN 103 by the
Contractor is enclosed as attachment 3) to this letter.

The design cost is summarized in the table below:
FCN 103 + 12% (OH&P) Determination by Contractor +12 % (OH&P)

Total

QAR 94,590.72 QAR 58,783

Table 1: Design Costs issue of EI’s reference 1) and 2)

The Engineer’s decision on the Contractor’s proposed mitigation measures is outstanding since April
2016 and appears as a recurring element in the weekly civil design meetings as per e.g. M006-LBE-ENGMOM-01033 item 16.2.

Until the Engineer decides on this matter, the Contractor cannot proceed with the relevant design, nor
with the evaluation of any potential additional costs.

The Engineer is therefore kindly requested to clarify the issue and revert back to the Contractor.

Yours faithfully,
