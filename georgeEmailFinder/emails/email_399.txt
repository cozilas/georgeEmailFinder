Subject: MS 6A- Room Completion Delays
Dear Sir,
We refer to your letter reference (1) above, in which, with reference to your earlier letter ref: (2),
you inform us of alleged lack of progress and a purported failure to achieve Milestone MS06A.
For the reasons set out in our letter ref {3), we refute that we are in any way culpable for such
delays and the delays to the Employer's fit-out contractors. We do not believe it necessary to
repeat that refutation herein on the ground it has already been comprehensively addressed in
our letter ref: {2).
That said, we do however reiterate that any on-going activities on our part associated with
snagging are not impacting ADAC as there are not only are the rooms complete [bar minor
snagging] and there are more than sufficient work fronts available to the Other Contractors, but
again - for the reasons set out in letter ref: {3) - the rooms are substantially complete. Our
position on this is therefore final.
Yours faithfully,
