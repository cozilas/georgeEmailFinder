, Dear Sir,
We refer to your letter dated 14 December 2014 ref: MTC-CMA-TCA-0401-LTR-02840 including Variation
Order No. 31 for the omission of liquified Petroleum Gas {LPG) included in BoQ items 4/P/5 items I, J, K
&L.
Taking the above into consideration we would like to highlight the following:
1.) Wording in Time Cost Record
We do not accept the wording of the Time&Cost Record. Please refer to our letter
MTB/TCA/ AECOM/L/001915 dated 15 July 2014. Kindly revise wording.
2.) Confirmation that items are omitted in its entire scope
All elements included in Defined Provisional Sums are part of our scope and hence th~
Engineer/Employer may not omit it simply in order to instruct a different Contractor to'
undertake the same package. We request your confirmation that you have fully omitted the LPG
system and that it has not been contracted to Others.
In case you wish to instruct Others with the scope for the LPG system we suggest Â·that
compensation of the identified 7% Overheads and Profits identified in t~e Contract, in this case
56,000 AED, be made to us.
3.) Functionality responsibility
It is the Employers responsibility to ensure functionality of the Project is still provided despite
the omission of the DPS scope of LPG works. We shall have no liability in this respect.
We await your confirmation of the above and re-issuance of the Variation Order in accordance
therewith.
Yours faithfully,
