Dear Sir,

The Contractor hereby submits a proposal to revise the milestone payment schedules as detailed in
Volume 2 Part 7 Clause 9.2.1 of the Commercial Proposal. The primary focus is to split the milestones
percentages which improve the Cash Flow of the Project.

The Contractor has revised Section No. 11 (Bin Mahmoud Station) for approval (see attached). All other
Stations will be revised in accordance with the same principles after acceptance of the Client.

The revised schedule is prepared by considering the following principles:

•

Construction Milestone Progress Payments

The Contractor has proposed 5% split for all Construction Milestone Progress Payments.

•

Final Payment of 100% for Construction Milestone Progress

The Contractor has proposed final 2.5% being withheld against quality compliance for the Construction
works which are 100% completed.

Since, Bin Mahmoud Station doesn’t have Passenger Access Walkway Milestone, the Contractor has
attached Passenger Access Walkway Milestone Splits for Ras Bu Abboud Station.

The Contractor requests that this proposal is given urgent consideration (In upcoming monthly
application – App 22) to help with the Project's Cash Flow.

We are available to attend meetings and provide any further clarification required.
Yours faithfully,
