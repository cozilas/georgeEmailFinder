Dear Sir,
We refer to your letter referenced (1) above, where you have made comments regarding the VAT
calculation for the payment certificates and hereby inform you the following:
With reference to Article 26 of the Decree-Law and to the Real estate Guide VATGRE1 (Clause 12.3
Retention Payment Pages 28-29, enclosed herewith), the date of supply for retention shall be triggered
at the earliest of:
•
•
•

The time the retention payment has been made;
The issuance of a tax invoice in relation to the retention; or
12 months from the date the work has been signed off as complete (e.g. certified).

In view of the above, the calculation for the VAT in the Payment Certificate must be as follows:
Total Value Of work done
Less-Retention @ 5%
Total Amount Excluding VAT
