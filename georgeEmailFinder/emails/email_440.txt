Subject:Post SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0088
Delays to Installation of BLTS Portals and Recheck Stations to Level L0.0 due Inaction by the
Employer / Employer’s Other Contractor (Fit-Out Works)
Dear Sir
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and / or circumstances described herein
may cause delay [and/or disruption] to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same
The Event(s):
On 30 April 2019, we received a letter from the Security Systems package subcontractor (‘ATLAS
Security’); ref: MTB-ATLAS-TCA-L-0395, notifying us of a series of factors affecting the installation of the
Baggage Labelling and Tracking System (BLTS) portals and re-check stations; including amongst other

things, the effect that the delays to commencement and completion of the Employer’s Fit-out Works to
Level L0.0 Sectors 5.12C and 5.22D is having on their works (refer to Table 1 below and the two marked
up Shop Drawings appended hereto).

Potential Impact:
It is evidently clear that our ability to complete the BLTS and associated works to the areas indicated in
Table 1 and reflected in the two marked up Shop Drawings appended hereto, have been and by all
accounts continue to be delayed by acts of prevention on the part of the Employer and / or the
Employer’s Other [Fit-Out] Contractor. If matters are allowed to continue, the delayed installation of
the BLTS Works will have far wider ramifications and not only impact Testing and Commissioning but will
invariably knock on and impact upon our ability to achieve Milestone MS09B. Similarly, this has the
potential to prevent us from achieving Substantial Completion (i.e. Milestone MS09C).
Action Required:
We therefore request your prompt action, decision or further instruction as may be applicable to resolve
the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works. Kindly
ensure that such matters are resolved within ten (10) days from the date of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve our rights under the provisions of Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses
16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [that have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to the Time for
Completion and any associated costs due to the event(s) and circumstances described herein.
Yours faithfully,
