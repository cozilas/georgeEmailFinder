Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer's Assistant letter reference 1) the Contractor notes that the under-platform
projector requirements contained within ABM2 form part of the Provisional Sum Architectural Works
package which is currently in the process of tender.

Prior to the receipt of Engineer's letter reference 2) which requested a price quotation pursuant to SubClauses
13.2.1 and 13.2.2 the Contractor was led to believe that the decision to omit the under-platform
projectors from the upcoming tender had already been made (see letter reference 3).

The Contractor does not accept therefore that the Contractor's quotation is a pre-requisite to a decision
that had already been taken in response to a request to resolve a potential doubling-up of display
systems.

In any event and under the current circumstances , the Engineer's Assistant is kindly requested to advise
whether the Contractor should include the under-platform projectors requirement as an optional item
in its invitation for tender on account of the Provisional Sum Architectural Works package.

Yours faithfully,
