Total Claim to Date
7,892,738.20

Accordingly, the total Claim Nr 011 value to date is QAR 7,892,738.20.

As the event giving rise to this Claim has a continuing effect, the Contractor shall be submitting further
interim Claim submissions with respect to the event giving rise to Claim Nr 011 pursuant to SubClause/General Condition 20.1.6(b) of the General Conditions of Contract.

The Contractor also reiterates its statement within reference 2 that it rejects the Engineer's Assistant's
("EA") disapproval of Claim 011 contained within reference 5 (and reiterated by the EA within references
1 and 3). The Contractor's detailed response to the EA's disapproval and detailed comments will be
submitted to the EA in due course.

Accordingly, the Contractor also disagrees with the EA's incorrect statement within reference 1 that
"The Engineer's Assistant considers that the effects resulting from the event or circumstance have
ended." This is incorrect because the event or circumstance, i.e.payment for DVE works upon Provisional
Sums,will continue up to completion of the Provisional Sum Works .

Yours faithfully,
