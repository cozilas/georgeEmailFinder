Dear Sir,

M006-QRC-PMT-LTR-00078 dated 24 March 2015
MOOG-GDB-COM-LTR-02102 dated 17 August 2015
M006-GDB-COM-LTR-02821 dated 5 January 2016

Refer to the Instruction issued under reference M006-QRC-PMT -LTR-00078 dated 24 March 2015,
which relates to the Variation of Employer's Requirements (ER) in respect of tunnel cross-passageway
spacing.

Pursuant to Sub-Clauses 3.5 and 13.6.1, the Engineer will now proceed to agree or determine
adjustments to the Contract Price and the Schedule of Payments resulting from this Variation.

With reference to your letters M006-GDB-COM-LTR-02102 and M006-GDB-COM-LTR-02821 dated 17
August 2015 and 5 January 2016 respectively, I propose for your consideration and agreement the
Employer's entitlement to cost savings as set out in Appendix A

Entitlement to time-based cost savings or savings associated with a reduction in construction risk have
not been considered at this stage.
In arriving at the proposed Employer's entitlement, the following points were among those considered:

1.
Any entitlement to cost savings should be based on the tendered schedule of rates for the
provision of cross-passageways.

2.
The implementation of the 'Singapore Solution' was an Employer initiative instructed via the
Engineer's letter of 24 March 2015. The instruction for the amendment of the ER relating to the spacing
of cross- passageways constitutes a variation from your original submitted design solution and is not
construed as Value Engineering under the Contract.
3.
The implementation of the 'Singapore Solution is predicated by a waiver from the Qatar Civil
Defence
(QCD) which was obtained by the Employer subsequent to your tender submission.

No later than 14 days from receipt of this letter, please inform us whether or not the Contractor agrees
with the assessment set out in Appendix A.

Yours faithfully,
