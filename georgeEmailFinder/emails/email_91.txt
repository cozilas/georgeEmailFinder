Subject Overdue Payment
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence (1) wherein the Contractor alleged that the Employer is in
breach of his obligations with regard to overdue payments
â€¢ We refute this and advise the Contractor as follows:
The Contractor is well aware that since the Effective Date of the Settlement Agreement and
Amendment No.8 {SAA8) and until today, they have failed to adhere to the prerequisites for payment.
The Contractor remains non-compliant with Clause 2.21.1 of SAA8 according to which the Contractor
should have demonstrated within sixty {60) Days from the date of the execution of SAA8 that they
have either reached settlement of all the Subcontractors' claims referred in Appendix A of the
Agreement or that it has issued a determination. Notwithstanding the above, and following various
Employer's concessions in order to assist the Contractor's cash flow the Engineer has been certifying
payments accordingly.
In addition, and according to Sub-Clause 6.4 of Schedule 11 of the Conditions of Contract, the
Minimum Payable Amount is identified as AED 20,000,000. The Contractor has been advised that the
assessed value from November 2019 and to date fell under this Minimum Payable Amount. The
Engineer's Payment Certificates referred to in correspondence (1) have been certified as a result of
further concessions from the Employer.
In light of the above, it is evident that the Employer is not in breach of Contract, and we advise that
the Employer has the right to reconsider these previous concessions in future payments until such
time that the Contractor fully complies with their contractual obligations which they are in breach of.
Yours faithfully,
