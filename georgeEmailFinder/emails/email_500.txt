Subject:Leak Re-Test Schedule - Notice of Claim
Dear Sir,

Further to the Contractor’s notifications listed above in (3) to (9) issued in respect of the leaks observed
during the site hose testing at piers 1 and 4, please find attached letter reference (1) sent by the
specialist roofing subcontractor Chadwick Technology LLC (Chadwick) which is self-explanatory.
Chadwick advises that, during a number of third party tests, water ingress was found as a result of the
Subcontractor’s defective workmanship. Consequently, Chadwick is being required to re-employ the
services of the third party testing agency to verify the integrity of the system once the remedial works
have been undertaken by the Subcontractor.
In its letter (1), Chadwick confirms that pier 4 was re-tested on 18 - 19 December 2018 and pier 1 will be
re-tested on 10 January 2018.
Please further note that Chadwick has requested an instruction, followed by a variation order, to
proceed with procurement of these additional tests. The Contractor confirms that all additional costs
incurred in relation to the Subcontractor’s defective workmanship will be back-charged to the
Subcontractor’s account.
MTB/TCA/JANGHO/L/001643
The Contractor reminds that its rights under the provisions of Clause 10.3 [Contractor’s Claims], Clause
12.12 [Other Contractors and Other Subcontractors] and Clause 16.6 [Delay Damages] of the Conditions
of Subcontract are reserved.

Yours faithfully,
