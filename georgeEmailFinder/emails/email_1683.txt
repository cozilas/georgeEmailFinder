Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer’s Instruction Nr.78 of reference 6) issued pursuant to General Condition (“GC”)
13.1.1 of Volume 3 of the Contract, the Contractor encloses herewith full particulars of part of its actual
design costs incurred to this date in relation to the urban integration of Pop-Ups.

As a direct consequence of the aforesaid instruction to vary the works and the ongoing coordination
process with the stakeholders, the Contractor instructed Atkins to proceed with the 3D Pop-Up study
and has received a notice for additional payment for the same.

The respective amounts in relation to FCN117 can be summarized as per the following table:
FCN 117

Amount claimed by Atkins

Table 1) FCN117: Amounts claimed by Atkins, ALYSJ JV Determination for the same and payments to
date

As detailed herein, the Contractor estimates that QAR 118,599.80 is a fair and reasonable compensation
to Atkins against the originally claimed value of QAR 190,842.00 which was, at the Contractor’s opinion,
overstated both in terms of the applicable staff rates and the respective time spent.

The Contractor has enclosed as attachments 1) and 2) to this letter respectively both its determination
of FCN 117 and the respective notice for additional payment as received by Atkins.

Whilst noting that none of its aforementioned determination amounts have been agreed with Atkins as
full and sole compensation with the entire balance being the subject of an ongoing dispute, the
Contractor has nevertheless paid the amount of QAR 118,599.80 already, for which, proof of payment in
the form of electronic payment (wire transfer) documents has been enclosed as attachment 3).

In any event, and whilst noting that the FCN 117 determination amount may be subject to further
change, the Contractor kindly requests the Employer to proceed with an interim, on-account payment of
its actual design costs incurred plus 12% for profits and overheads, in the net amount of QAR
132,831.80.

Such payment would be of invaluable assistance to the continued financing of the Project.

Yours faithfully
