Dear Sir,
We acknowledge receipt of the above referenced Request for Variation Order (RFVO) for providing
Access
for MEP Works.
Given that the event against which the claim is raised has occurred, you should be able to provide
substantiation of the actual costs incurred. Documents that should be available would include
timesheets
and invoices from your suppliers to support the hours claimed. Furthermore, we request you to provide
records of the Works undertaken. We highlight that pursuant to Conditions of the Subcontract
Agreement
clause 8.1.2 "The Subcontractor, without additional compensation, shall vary the sequence of its Works
as
the Contractor may reasonably instruct. The Subcontractor shall conform to the Contractor's hours of
work. The Subcontractor shall promptly increase its work force or other resources, accelerate its
performance, work overtime, Fridays and holidays, all without additional compensation, as necessary to
maintain progress of the Subcontract Works."

Upon receipt of the above information we shall undertake a detailed review of the claim and issue our
determination accordingly.

The delay notice is not in accordance with clause 27.1.1 of the condition of contract as it was not
provided within the required 28 days drom the date the contractor became aware of the alleged delay.

In addition, the contractor shall provide evidence that it took all reasonable steps to avoid or mitigate
the alleged delays as required under clause 16.5.3.
Yours faithfully
