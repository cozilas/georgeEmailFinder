Dear sir
Please find attached letter reference (1) sent by the Other Subcontractor J&H Emirates LLC (Jangho) who
is currently executing the glazing works of the car park link bridges.
Jangho claims that the precast concrete slab edge executed by the Subcontractor is outside the
allowable
tolerance, which in turn is impacting the execution of Jangho's glass panels. Jangho further requires that
the precast concrete surface line is rectified thus enabling it to proceed with the fabrication and
installation of the last bottom glass panel.
Whilst notifying the Subcontractor of a possible event giving rise to a claim under the provisions of
Clause
10.3.1 of the Conditions of Subcontract, the Contractor requests the Subcontractor provides its
comments
(if any) in relation to this event.
Yours faithfully,
