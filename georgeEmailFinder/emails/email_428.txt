Subject: Pipework and other infrastructure subsidence, earthworks: unsuitable backfill

Dear Sirs,
We refer to various meetings, discussions and e-mails concerning the results of the tests conducted on
the fill material you have indicated should be used for the subsidence remedials and other earthworks.
We are of the opinion that the test results clearly show that this material is inappropriate for the
intended
use and remind you of the statement made by our technical expert from Robert Bird Group that can be
summarised as follows:
"Stockpile 2 material used on site to backfill excavations is found to have high fines content, although in
compliance with the earthworks specification which allows up to 50% fines. Backfill material with high
fines content is more likely to experience higher movements than a material with a very low fines
content,
particularly when the material exhibits high plasticity index. In addition, the material also contains
gypsum, which is a soluble salt. Laboratory test results of material taken from the stockpile 2,
compacted
to 95%MDD, have shown potential risk of collapse when inundated with water. We therefore do not
recommend the use of this material as fill in order to minimize risk of ground movement."
Whilst we still await your written Instruction in regard to backfill material we confirm that given the
subsidence that has occurred in infrastructure works that has incorporated materials from this source,
we cannot agree to the use material from Stockpile 2 in remedial or other earthworks on this Project.
Yours faithfully
