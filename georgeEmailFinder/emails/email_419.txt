Subject:Clause 27.1.1: Notice of Claim – Delay Notice No. 0030 [Post SAA8]
Material Submittals Pending with AECOM [30 October 2018] - Update
Dear Sir
This letter serves as an update to E-Notice No. 0030 issued by way of our e-mail ref: (1).
By way of reminder: In the period between 22 April 2018 and 22 October 2018, we submitted twenty
four (24) Material Submittals requesting your review and approval of various MEP and Architectural
materials referenced therein. Details of each of these material submittals and the specific dates and
manner in which they were issued to you, and that were reflected in the list attached to our E-Notice
No. 0030 issued via ref: (1), have been reproduced in the summary attached at Annex A hereto.
The information recorded in Annex A hereto, indicates that at the date of preparing E-Notice No. 0030
(ref: 1), i.e. 30 October 2018 you exceeded the review periods for the majority of the material submittals
expressly stipulated in Article 1.3 of Specification Section 013300 ‘Submittal Procedures’; hence the
issuance of our E-Notice. Notably the responses to 4 out of those 24 Material Submittals were
incorrectly shown to be ‘pending’ when in fact they were not (items 14, 18, 19 and 23). Out of these,
two Submittals were in fact received on time (items 14 and 19). This has now been corrected.
We have since reviewed the same Material Submittals that were subject to E-Notice No. 0030 and
herewith attach an update of the same schedule at Annex B, reflecting the position as at 9 June 2019.
However, this indicates that in respect of the 20 Material Submittals that were in fact overdue at the
time, you continued to exceed the review periods expressly stated in the Contract for 19 of those for
periods of up to 137 calendar days; albeit your response to item 20 is still shown to be outstanding.
We further record that although some of the Material Submittals listed in Annex A were submitted and
responded to prior to the ‘Effective Date’ included in SAA8 (i.e. before 4 September 2018), there were
some Submittals (i.e. MS/0401/C/0861 [item 9], MS/0401/A/1679 [item 21], MS/0401/S/0418 [item 24])
which despite being issued prior to SAA8, failed to be responded to until afterwards. This cannot
possibly be construed as forming part of or ‘Included Circumstances’ (per Clause 1.7.4 of SAA8) and will
be included within any forthcoming Time Impact Analysis, albeit in recognition of the Effective Date
included in SAA8, any delays will be analysed from 4 September 2018 onwards.

In the meantime, it is clear that any ‘lateness’ in responding to the Material Submittals subject to our
earlier E-Notice constitutes an act of prevention and/or breach of Contract and accordingly, we give you
notice pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 of our right to claim:
(i)
An extension to the Time for Completion pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c); and
(ii)
An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.1 pursuant to Clause 9.10, or,
in the alternative, damages for breach of contract.
Interim and/or final details of the time impacts and adjustments to the Contract Price relating to this
event will be provided in due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.5(a), (b) and (c).
Yours faithfully,
