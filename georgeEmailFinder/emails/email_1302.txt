Dear Sir,
Further to the above references and our recent discussions wherein we have requested you to provide
the outstanding Cost substantiation for prolongation Costs for EOT 1 for the period: from Nov-14 to
March-15, it is recorded that, as at the date of this letter, you have failed to do so.
You are hereby requested to submit within five (5) days of receipt of this letter the outstanding Cost
substantiation. We note that should you fail to provide the requested substantiation it would prejudice
the outcome of your entitlement (if any) for prolongation Costs for EOT 1.
Furthermore, if we do not receive the requested substantiation within five (5) days of receipt of this
letter, we shall assume that you have waived any and all entitlement during the periods that you had
failed to provide either the requested detailed substantiation or satisfactory substantiation.
For the avoidance of doubt, the request for the outstanding Cost substantiation is not, of itself, to be
considered as an admission of any entitlement to an extension of the Time for Completion and/or
payment of additional Costs, nor does it constitute a waiver of any of the terms of the Subcontract.
Yours faithfully,
