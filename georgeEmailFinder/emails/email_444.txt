Subject:Clause 27.1.1: Notice of Claim – Delay Notice No. 0005 [Post SAA8]
Overdue As-Built Drawing Submittals [at 3 November 2018] - Update
Dear Sir
This letter serves as an update to E-Notice No. 0005 issued by way of our letter ref: (1).
By way of reminder: Between 19 November 2017 and 17 October 2018 we submitted 32 As-Built
Drawing submittals containing 208 As-Built Drawings in relation to 11 different packages (including
amongst others MEP and Telecommunication) for your review and approval. These were submitted in
the manner recorded in the ‘Master Log’ included at Annex B and summarised in Annex A hereto.
However, the information recorded in Annexes A and B, indicates that at the cut-off date associated
with letter ref: 1, which is 3 November 2018, you exceeded the review periods expressly stipulated in
Article 1.3 of Specification Section 013300 ‘Submittal Procedures’; hence the issuance of our E-Notice.
We have since reviewed the same Submittals that were subject to letter ref: (1) and herewith attach an
update of the ‘Master Log’ and summary at Annexes C and D hereto, assessed to 22 April 2019. This

shows that you continued to exceed the review periods expressly stated in the Contract for the noted
Submittals by upwards of 144 calendar days; with one instance being 384 calendar days late.
In the case of the latter, we record that despite As-Built Submittal No. AD/0401/I/0020 Rev. 00 being
submitted to you on 19 November 2017, this was not responded to until 29 December 2018. This
cannot possibly be construed as forming part of ‘Included Circumstances’ (per Clause 1.7.4 of SAA8) and
therefore will be included within any forthcoming Time Impact Analysis, albeit in recognition of the
‘Effective Date’ included in SAA8, any delays will be analysed from 4 September 2018 onwards.
In the meantime, it is clear that any ‘lateness’ in responding to the As-Built Submittals subject to letter
ref: (1) constitutes an act of prevention and/or breach of Contract and accordingly, we give you notice
pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 of our right to claim:
(i)
An extension to the Time for Completion pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c); and
(ii)
An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.1 pursuant to Clause 9.10, or,
in the alternative, damages for breach of contract.
Interim and/or final details of the time impacts and adjustments to the Contract Price relating to this
event will be provided in due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.5(a), (b) and (c).
Yours faithfully,
