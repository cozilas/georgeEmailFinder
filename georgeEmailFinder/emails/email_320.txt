Subject:Post SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0158
Delays to Installation of Baggage Handling System (BHS) and Access Control (SACS) due to NonCompletion of Works by the Employer’s Fit-Out Contractor in VIP/First Class and Business Class Check-in
Areas
Dear Sirs,
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
The Employer’s fit out contractor is yet to complete its works sufficiently in the VIP/First Class and
Business Class Check-in Areas on L2.0 to allow the completion of the Baggage Handling System (BHS)
works and associated access control (SACS) equipment.
Potential Impact
Acts of prevention on the part of others such as that outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
increasingly likely to impact on achievement of Milestones MS07, MS9B and MS9C (Substantial
Completion).
Action Required

We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within seven (7) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
Presently, the Employer’s fit out contractor is yet to complete the finishes in the VIP/First Class and
Business Class Check-in Areas on L2.0.
As a result, we have been prevented from installing BHS control panels, SACS equipment and completing
the certification of the Weigh Scales at the areas stated. As a result, unless and until the
abovementioned fit out works are progressed sufficiently by others, we are unable to complete the BHS
Works as per the specified criteria.
Resultant Impact:
Our ability to complete the indicated BHS and SACS works to the areas indicated above, have been
delayed by acts of prevention on the part of the Employer and / or the Employer’s Other Contractor. If
such acts of prevention continue, then this will have wider ramifications; not only on installations but
will also impact upon Testing and Commissioning which will invariably knock on and impact upon our
ability to achieve Milestone MS07. Similarly, this has the potential to prevent us from achieving
Substantial Completion (i.e. Milestone MS09C).
Yours faithfully,
