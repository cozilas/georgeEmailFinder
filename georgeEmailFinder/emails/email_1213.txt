Subject: Substantiation of Contractor's Mark-Up for Variations
·-·
Dear Sir,
Further to our letter L/000931 above, we are pleased to attach hereto an original letter from Ernst &
Young dated 10 March 2014 for 'Agreed Upon Procedures' relating to " ... calculation of the mark-up
percentage on total costs ... " .
This independent engagement, carried out in terms of ISRS No 4400, determined that the mark-up on
total cost, being direct and indirect cost (excluding provisional sums and day-works), equated to 11.23%.
As we had in our referenced letter L/000931 supported justification for a mark-up on Cost of 11.11% for
Variation works, we consider that the determination from the independent financial authority of Ernst
and Young has supported our mark-up.
We trust that the above will be sufficient to demonstrate the mark-up included in the rates and prices
within the Contract Price for Works excluding Provisional Sums and that all Variations on hold pending
agreement of the mark-up can now be settled with an 11.11% mark-up on Cost.
We await your response.
Yours faithfully,
