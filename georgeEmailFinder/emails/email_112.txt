Subject:Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic â€“ Camp Lockdown Report
Dear Sirs,
We refer to our letters ref: (1) to (3) in relation to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic.
In particular, we refer to our e-mail ref: (4) in which we forwarded you a copy of an e-mail received on
27 March 2020, from our specialist geotechnical foundation company, BAUER, undertaking the
subsidence remediation and grouting works (further copy attached). In short:
BAUER advised were advised by ICAD Accommodation Management that Al Yass Building No. 1 would
be locked down whilst an investigation was carried out regarding a single worker who was displaying flu
like symptoms. Although the worker in question is not a BAUER employee nor sub-contractor nor does
he have any association with the BAUER business, the decision from the ICAD Accommodation
Management is that the whole building is to be quarantined for 14 days with temperature monitoring of
all workers on daily basis. Within this building are 31 workers who are currently assigned to the Airport
grouting works.
BAUER have informed us that arrangements have been made to replace the affected workers from
within the BAUER pool of labour to progress the grouting works without disruption. BAUER further
advises us that all of their workers are checked for good health and temperature daily prior to them
boarding the site buses, plus they have increased the number of busses as well as reduced the number
of workers on each bus, in accordance with guidelines, so that social distancing recommendations are
maintained.
We will continue to monitor the situation closely, both for this particular issue as well other Coronavirus
(COVID-19) Pandemic related matters generally, and keep you updated as and when matters develop.
Yours faithfully,
