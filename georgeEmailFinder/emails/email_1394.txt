Dear Sir,

Further to the Contractor's formal Notice of Claim No 011 issued under cover of reference 1 (in
accordance with Sub-Clause/General Condition 20.1.2 of the General Conditions of Contract) concerning

the above titled matter, the Contractor hereby encloses its Claim No 011 formal interim submission
(Revision O) in accordance with Sub-Clause/General Condition 20.1.6 of the General Conditions of
Contract.

As the event giving rise to this claim has a continuing effect, the attached Claim No 011 submission is to
be considered as interim in accordance with Sub-Clause/General Condition 20.1.6(a) of the General
Conditions of Contract. The Contractor shall therefore be submitting further interim claim submissions
with respect to the event giving rise to Claim No 011 at monthly intervals as required by SubClause/General Condition 20.1.6(b) of the General Conditions of Contract.

Yours faithfully,
