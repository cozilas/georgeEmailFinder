Subject:Notice to Correct – QA/QC Management
Dear Sir,
We write in regards to the above subject matter in order to reaffirm our concerns regarding your
performance and management of the Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) processes. Our
previous correspondences (3 and 4) highlight your failures in maintaining a reasonable rate of progress
in relation to the issuance and closing-out of WIR’s – as of today’s date we are yet to see a noticeable
improvement in your performance.
Moreover, our Construction Team have now raised concerns with regards to the accuracy of the reports
issued by your Project QA/QC Manager, Mr. Ronnel Leano. We enclose email correspondences detailing
the issues concerned. We take this opportunity to formally place on record that unless the performance
of Mr. Leano significantly improves we will have no option but to enact the mechanisms within the
contract under Sub-Clause 14.9.3 [Subcontractor’s Personnel].
In view of the above, we hereby instruct you under Subcontract Clause 22.1 [Notice to Correct] to
immediately remedy the above failures and take all necessary measures to improve your QA/QC
performance.
This is for your information and necessary action.

Yours faithfully,
