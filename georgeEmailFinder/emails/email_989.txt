Subject NAFFCO Continuous Ongoing Lack of Performance - Response to the Engineer's
Dear Sir,
In response to your letter {1) above, we hereby acknowledge receipt of the letter {2) confirming the
Contractor's commitment to achieving the 30 June 2019 substantial completion date in accordance
with the Target Programme to completion Rev 10.4. We reiterate that the Engineer has rejected the
Contractor's assertion that this programme is 'accelerated' in numerous previous correspondence.
The Contractor in the above correspondence (1) has stated "when assessed against the update of the
Rev 10.4 Programme as of 01 January 2018, there is no slippage in the final completion date of 30 June
2019, caused by the alleged delays in NAFFCO's performance."
We hereby record our observations against the planned progress of fire protection activities against
the Target Programme to Completion Rev 10.4.
As of 01 February 2018, the Contractor has failed to make any progress on several Fire Protection
System activities such as Fire Pipe Installation, Pressure Testing of Fire Pipes, Sprinklers Installation,
Fire Hose Cabinet Installation and Gaseous Suppression System Installation. We further observed that
many of the above delayed activities total float values have dropped below 30 Days as per the
Contractor critical activity definition in Rev 10.4.
We also record that the primary cause of these delays is the lack of coordination, delay in material
procurement and the shortage of resources from the Contractor and its Subcontractors as highlighted

during the weekly meetings.
Yours faithfully,
