Subject:

Roofing As-Built Drawings – Unfair Code 3

Dear Sir,
With reference to the above mentioned subject and the related correspondence the Contractor wishes
to respond as follow.
The Contractor reiterates its position as clarified in the letter reference (2) and refers to a meeting held
between the Contractor and the Engineer on the 19 August 2018 in which the Contractor explained our
objection. It was agreed that the Engineer will review the comments which are irrelevant and not
applicable and revert back to the Contractor with amended status of the drawings. (evidence of
scheduled meeting attached)
We have also disclosed our internal email exchange with our Sub-Contractor to the Engineer as basis for
discussions to be held in meeting dated 19 July 2018, and again discussed in the above mentioned
meeting dated 19 August 2018. (see attached email)
After discussions and agreeing to revise the drawing status, on the contrary the Contractor received the
Engineer’s letter reference (1) still insisting that the As-Built Drawings received the correct Code 3 status
and the Contractor to amend the drawings as necessary and resubmit.
With reference to IFC drawing MTC-A-31-TB_L_._0.00 00.354 Envelope Type PR Pier Roof ‘Bath Tub’
Gutter detail a note on the drawing reads as follow “Gutter to over top safely” and refers to a particular

detail/section on the drawing. However, the comments received from the Engineer for the As-Built
drawing reads “As per previous comment and IFC “Gutter to over top safely”.” refers to a completely
different section/detail of the drawing and thus cannot be construed as the Contractor not adequately
addressing comments previously raised rendering a Code 3 status. This is incorrect and misleading.
Roofing As-Built drawings will not be re-submitted until the Engineer and the Employer consult with
KPF/Arup to satisfactory resolve this issue.
Yours faithfully,
