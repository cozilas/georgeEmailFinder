Subject Damage to Live Fire Line on 15 September 2019
Dear Sir,
We refer to the incident that took place on 15 September 2019 whilst conducting drilling works for the
permeation grouting which clashed with a live fire water main and resulted in significant water loss
into the surrounding ground and we raise the following concerns:
1. The Contractor failed to adhere to their approved Method Statement, Risk Assessment and
Project Health and Safety requirements at all times.
2. The Contractor failed to submit an initial investigation and incident report indicating the root
cause of this event, within 24hrs of the incident.
3. To date, the Contractor has failed to report any water seepage I damage to adjacent areas
that may be impacted by the incident.
4. To date, the Contractor has failed to survey all existing and known monitoring points, in order
to determine if any noteworthy change has occurred.
5. Many of the current As-built Drawings have yet to achieve Code 1 status. The Contractor is
therefore unable to rely on this information and must exercise all caution at site to verify the
location of utilities, both permanent and temporary. This is not just limited to the MTB
Contract but other interfacing Contracts and temporary works installations that may have
been installed by others.
6. The Contractor has failed to evaluate at site the accuracy of their As-built Drawings I BIM
modelling with regard to permanent and temporary utilities I services, and provide a list of all
latest drawings being utilised at site. A permit to excavate I drill must be developed with an
adequate clearance form signed off by the Contractor and all relevant Subcontractors and the
respective HSE department, prior to commencing works.
7. Given the above failures, the Contractor is to demonstrate the integrity of their procedures

through identifying existing underground utilities and services via trial trenches, scanning
equipment, red-line marking, etc. and to establish necessary precautions, permits, and
incident response plans for drilling around live/existing utilities.
8. The Contractor is to consider submitting a setting-out survey report for the drilling location
and justify and verify any clashing between utilities and drilling points.
We advise that the Contractor will be held responsible for all costs associated with any remedial works
necessary and that may be required to the surrounding ground consequent to any damage as a result
of collapse due to the water accumulation within the open trenches.
We hereby reserve the Employers' rights under Clause 10.3 of the Conditions of Contract for any
delays and damages associated with the above.
Yours faithfully,
