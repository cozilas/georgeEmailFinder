Dear sir
We recently sent you a transmittal #1 carrying Engineers Instruction El No. 544 amongst other things. It
has come to our knowledge that TCAJV have disputed this El and we would like to recall this from you
until further instructions.
We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.
Yours faithfully,
