Dear Sirs,

Further to the Contractor's fully detailed initial interim Claim Nr 036 submission issued under cover of
reference 7 and, further to a subsequent December 2015 monthly Claim Nr 036 update issued under
cover of reference 3, the Contractor hereby provides its January 2016 monthly update of said Claim in
accordance with General Condition ("GC") 20.1.6(b) of Volume 3 of the Contract.

On 17 December 2015 the Contractor received the Engineer's/Engineer's Assistant's instruction , via
reference 4 "to resume design activity for Al Rayyan Station and for the associated Tunnel Sections,
effective the day after this letter is formally received by the Contractor via Aconex ." However, the letter
was received on Thursday 17 December 2015; therefore, the actual day after receipt was Friday 18
December 2015. Consequently, the next business day (pursuant to GC 1.4.2) within the Country/Qatar
following receipt of the 17 December 2015 letter , was Sunday 20 December 2015 . This is therefore the

effect ive date for the lifting of the suspension of the designs to the associated Tunnel Sections to Al
Rayyan Station. The Contractor has

therefore revised its Time Impact Analysis ("TIA") accordingly based upon the 20 December 2015
effective lifting of suspension date (the original TIA is included within Appendix B of the initial Claim
submission).

The revised TIA (hard and soft copies) is attached to this January 2016 update.

The Contractor apologises for not addressing the lifting of the suspension within its December 2015
update.

The quantum of the delay and the extension of time entitlement now claimed within this interim
January 2016 monthly update for Claim Nr 036 are contained within the below table:

Completion Milestone Contract "Time for Completion" (TND) Impacted I Delayed "Time for
Completion" Due to Claim/Delay Event (Delay Event ended upon effective date of
20.12.15).

Delay (Calendar Days) - Extension of Time Entitlement

TUNNEL SECTION:
Tunnel - Doha Zoo to Al Rayyan South (Design only) (Ref M006.YW.BB.ZOO)
31.07.16
09.01.17
162
Tunnel - Al Rayyan South to Muaither (Design only) (Ref M006.YW.BB.RYS)
31.07.16
09.01.17

162

This January 2016 Claim Nr 036 update therefore demonstrates that, due to the Claim EvenUDelay
EvenUSuspension, the Contractor is currently entitled to an extension of 162 days to the Time for
Completion for (1) the (Design of) Tunnel Section 'Doha Zoo to Al Rayyan South' (Section Ref
M006.YW.BB.ZOO) and,
(2) the (Design of) Tunnel Section 'Al Rayyan South to Muaither' (Section Ref M006.YW.BB.RYS),
pursuant to GC 8.4.1(b) and GC 8.9.1(a) of Volume 3 of the Contract and, pursuant to Article 172.1 (good
faith) and Article 220 (unjust enrichment) of the Qatar Civil Code (Law No 22 of 2004).

The Contractor also confirms that the following costs information in relation to Claim Nr 036 has been
received by the Contractor over the past month. Accordingly, the Contractor also provides this January
2016 Financial monthly update to Claim Nr 036.

On 21 January 2016, the Contractor received its Lead Designer's claim FCN 115 entitled "Resume Design
to Al Rayyan Station" (reference M006-ATK-COM-LTR-00928, dated 21 January 2016 which is attached
to this

update letter). FCN 115 is a combined claim for the resumption of design/remobilization costs for the
Lead Designer's design teams involved with (1) the suspended designs to Al Rayyan South Station
(Contractor's Claim Nr 029) and, (2) the suspended designs of the tunnels associated with Al Rayyan
South Station (Contractor's Claim Nr 036). It is difficult to currently separate these costs so, for the
present January 2016 updates of the aforementioned Contractor's Claims; the Contractor has
apportioned 50% of the FCN 115 claimed figure (i.e. 50% of OAR 1,753,360.00 = OAR 876,680.00) to
each of the Contractor's Claim Nrs 029 and 036.

The Contractor's overheads and profit "(OHP") upon same is therefore: OAR 876,680.00 x 13% (OHP
rate) = OAR 113,968.00.
This provides a January 2016 updated Financial Summary for Claim 036 as follows :

As the Claim Event giving rise to this Claim has a continuing effect and the Contractor is still collating
further particulars, the Contractor shall be submitting further interim Claim submissions with respect to
the Claim Event giving rise to Claim Nr 036 at monthly intervals as required by GC 20.1.6(b).

Yours faithfully,
