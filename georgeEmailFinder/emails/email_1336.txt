Dear Sir,
We acknowledged receipt of your letter pertaining to your accusations of our failure to coordinate with
civil works
during energization with local authorities and would respond as follows to the comments raised within.
To begin with, please be informed that clearance for civil department is given by your responsible
project engineer and
civil works started with the afore said permissions given by your selves. We therefore advise you that
before accusing
the main contractor with the lack of coordination between other parties, you must coordinate within
your organization

structure since it is abundantly clear that you deficiencies in your communication if you are wri'ting such
kind of letters
and accusing us without knowing the facts of the real site status.
Furthermore, regardless the fact that local authorities comes to inspect the substations as a group,
CM1A (room 90)
and CM1B (Room 97) in this case, room 97 was accessible all the time since civil works were impacting
only room 90 as
it can be seen in even in your letter reference MTB/ANEL/TCA/L/3205 dated OS May 2016.
As a result of the afore said and for the records, it has come to light that you were not able to
coordinate internally and deliberately choose to accuse main contractor with erroneous facts to cover
up or making excuses for your lack of coordination and delays for the works completion in the
concerned area.
We believe we made our position clear for your false accusations and shall this attitude of Anel
continues, will not be tolerated and we have no exercise to use our right to remove the responsible
accuser who deliberately relays misleading information with the official letters from the-project as per
the strict acGordance of conditions of contract 14.9.3.
Yours faithfully,
