Subject: Basement water leaks
Dear sir
We write with reference to the correspondence (1) regarding the basement water leaks. Assurance was
provided by the contractor that the leakage was a minor issue that could be easily treated and that the
waterproofing was performing and continues to be fit for purpose, however, the contractor did not
engage a third party as requested by the engineer to investigate and report on the cause, extent and
impact of the waterproofing defects.
The uncontrolled entry and leakage of groundwater through the basement slabs may adversely affect
the design service life of the structure, in light of the widespread leakage observed in CP LB1 and your
protracted and repeated efforts to control and remedy groundwater ingress into the building, the
contractor is again requested to employ a specialist third party to thoroughly investigate and report on
its findings and recommendations on the prolonged ingress of groundwater through the building
substructure.
The contractor is also required to reassess the current repair methodology and to confirm if it is still
considered to be the most practical repair solution, or whether a more effective leak rectification option
should now be considered to eliminate the recurrence of groundwater intrusion into the building.
Lastly, the contractor is requested to present its full and complete records of the mapping that has been
carried out for the leaks identification and repairs.
Yours faithfully,
