ANNEX A

Introduction
We write to notify you of our concern regarding your overdue response to our ‘Method Statement for

Notably, the PBBs and all associated works have been completed and in conjunction with the PBB
Subcontractor (M/s ThyssenKrupp) have been handed over to you vide the Work Inspection Requests
(WIR) process. However, having submitted Document Submittal No. DS/0401/15060 Rev. 00 on 10
December 2019 seeking your approval of the ‘Method Statement for Demobilisation Activities’, we note
that at the at the cut-off date of this Notice (7 April 2020), you failed to reply (see Table 1 below):

We remind you that Article 1.3 of Specification Section 013300 ‘Submittal Procedures’ governs the
processing time by which you are contractually obligated to respond to our Submittals. On the basis
that Document Submittal No DS/0401/15060 is at Rev. 00, then this ought to have been responded to by
you, 21 calendar days later, i.e. on 31 December 2019. However, the information shown in Table 1
shows that at the cut-off date associated with this Notice (i.e. 7 April 2020), you exceeded and at that
point continued to exceed the review period expressly stipulated in the Contract by 98 calendar days.
Any such delay, irrespective of duration, is wholly unacceptable, particularly at this stage of the Project.
We further record that the PBB Subcontractor (M/s ThyssenKrupp) has written on this delaying event
also via letter ref: (1), notifying us of their right to claim the time and/or cost impacts arising therefrom.
Your delay in review and approval of the abovementioned submittal will impact our ability to achieve
Substantial Completion.
Our entitlement to an extension of time and financial compensation resulting from the aforementioned
act(s) of prevention will apply irrespective of any alleged failure on our part [which is denied], to
transmit submittals to you in a timely manner.
Yours faithfully,
