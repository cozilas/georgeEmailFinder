Dear Sir,

The Engineer's Assistant refers to the above letter referenced at (1) and notes that ALYSJ are relying on
the Employer's Requirements and subsequent information received.

In order to alleviate concerns, various workshops that were attended by both the Systems PMC and
ALYSJ were conducted in order to assess the details of both 33kV cables and DC Traction Power Supply
cables within the Gold Line Stations. It was acknowledged by these attendees, that the needs in relation
to Systems Cables at the Al Sharq Emergency Exit were as for those within Gold Line Stations. In the
particular instance of EE Al Sharq a similar requirement is inferred for Blue Line Tunnel.

In particular, we note your reference to the meeting of 13 May 2015 at which all issues related to design
of the shaft were discussed and agreed allowing design to proceed.

We wish to clarify point 3 of your letter and record that the design of the cross passages was not agreed
in the meeting. The design of both shafts should cater for design of cross passages while acknowledging
that the cross passages to the Blue line will be constructed by others. In this regard it was discussed that
the best solution would be to have one single cross passage per tunnel which is wide enough to
accommodate pedestrians and the TPS cables. ALYSJ was requested to review their design based on this
discussion.

Therefore, Contractor is expected to provide a design in accordance with the Employer's Requirements
(ER) and consider information that was discussed in the workshops and meeting of 13 May 2015 to
ensure compliance with Employer's Requirements.

The ngineer's Assistant looks forward to Contractor's submission of its proposed schedule of design
deliverables and subsequent construction schedule.

Yours faithfully,
