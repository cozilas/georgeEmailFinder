In addition to the five (5) RFIs issued in respect of various design-related issues affecting the nine (9)
doors identified above, we also raised RFI/0401/16547 on 31 October 2018, seeking clarification of the
smoke rated separation under the escalators above the Bank Units to Level L0.1, sectors 5.16 and 5.21;
which you responded to on 21 November 2018 in the manner shown in Table 2 below:

The information listed in Tables 1 and 2, provides details as to the RFI reference numbers, the date each
RFI was raised, a description of the query and / or information required from you, the affected doors,
the date the reply to each RFI was required by us, and the date when you actually responded.
Firstly, we wish to record that all of six RFIs listed above, were not responded by you within the ‘reply
required’ by dates expressly required by us and stated on each RFI. At this stage of the Project, for you
to take upwards of 45 calendar days later than the ‘reply required’ by date to respond to the various
matters identified therein, is wholly unacceptable and will invariably knock-on and have a consequential
impact on our progress and delay us; such delay was otherwise wholly avoidable.
Secondly, we wish to put on record that your responses to all five (5) RFIs listed in Table 1 above,
introduced substantial changes to our original scope of Works to nine (9) doors, including but not
limited to changes to Door Type, Door Material, Handing, Doors Hardware and Fire Rating etc.
Moreover, such changes will result in us having to undertake the following activities or processes, which
will involve the coordination of numerous subcontractors and/or manufacturers:
•
Engineering and Shopdrawing approvals;
•
Procurement and installation of new doors hardware;
•
Procurement and installation of new doors;
•
Wiring and Installation of Door Control Units (DCUs) to comply with the SACS changes
introduced (if SACS is added);
•
Engineering and Shop Drawing to update SACS requirement with the reference SACS ID no. (if
SACS added)
•
Procurement and installation of new frames, steel supports and new glass;
•
Wiring installation for Fire Alarm (if Linked to Fire Alarm is added);

•
Wiring connections and Installation for power assist (if Power assist added); and
•
Changes to the Master Key Schedule.
At Annex B hereto, we attach a comprehensive schedule listing each of the 9 doors subject to the RFIs
listed in Table 1, which compares the design information/requirements prior to SAA8 and the changes
that you introduced through the responses to the RFIs. The changes between the two sets of data
(whether this be the door material door type, handing, fire rating, hardware set and any link to the fire
life safety system), is clearly highlighted in yellow for ease of identification and reference.
In order for us to undertake and instigate changes such as those noted above, we will require fully
coordinated revised IFC Drawings encapsulating the changes introduced in your RFI responses, and
further remind you that SAA8 laid down mandatory procedures to be followed if additional works are
required, in so far as an EI and VO are needed for us to proceed with the aforementioned changes.
The provisions of Clauses 2.29 to 2.31 of SAA8 pertaining to Variations are clear; we are not to proceed
with any Variation unless a Variation Order and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. In which
respect, it is your obligation to issue this Record first if you wish to instigate change; this is only after the
additional time and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.
We once again take this opportunity in reminding you that the responsibility under the Contract for the
design of doors and the integration of those parts of the Works which are intrinsically linked to the
doors, including hardware, fire rating and the like, lies with the Employer. Our responsibility is to follow
with due diligence the Drawings and Specifications, and it is our position that we have discharged, and
continue to discharge, this obligation with the necessary expertise, care and skill that could reasonably
be expected from an experienced contractor.
RFI/0401/15727
Meanwhile, we wish to comment on the relevance of including RFI/0401/15727 within this E-Notice No.
0138 on the basis it was raised and responded to in the period prior to SAA8; as follows:
On 19 February 2018, we raised RFI/0401/15727 seeking further clarification in relation to two doors
located within sectors 5.16 and 5.22 to Level L0.1 to the CP area (tag nos. L01-0015.01 and L01-0023.01)
[Room Nos. 0015 and 0023], owing to the fact that the doors had been recorded in an earlier workshop
meeting as having been placed “ON HOLD” and was “pending coordination among KPF/AL-GHURAIR”;
and requested you to advise and confirm the status of the doors.
You responded on 22 April 2018 as follows:
‘The door was put on hold due to discussions regarding how the wall will be supported between L0.1L2.0 slab which have considerable differential movement. It has been decided that the full height of the
wall would sit on L0.1 slab. The sketch drawing can be found in the attached ASK-3919 (RFI-0401-15727)
(1 Sheet). The door to be rebated. ADAC has stated the possibility of cancelling the access control in the
future. The hardware set has been changed to fail safe for an easy conversion. Refer to attached ASK3919 (RFI-0401 -15727) (1 Sheet) for the hardware configuration.’
A copy of sketch ASK-3919 (RFI-0401 -15727) (1 Sheet) and the accompanying hardware set attached to
your response, is shown in Figure 1 below:
Figure 1
However, as set out in our letter dated 25 September 2018, at reference (9), the specified hardware set
“is inappropriate and not constructible to the given sketch and profile of the door for 45 minutes Fire
Rated Door”; i.e. the hardware is unsuitable for \ fails to provide 45 minutes fire rating. We further
advised that these doors are part of the testing and commissioning at Level L0.1 with a Security Access
Control System (SACS) requirement and moreover, the information provided in your response to
RFI/0401/15727 is insufficient to enable us to proceed and construct / install the door.

Accordingly, we requested that you provide “proper and clear instruction[s] along with [appropriate] IFC
Drawings and Door Schedule” detailing how we are to proceed. We further recorded that in any event
to proceed with such a late design change including the resultant abortive works and the requirement to
fabricate a new door at this stage, would invariable cause a delay to the Works. As such our letter ref:
(8) also served as a formal request for an Engineer’s Instruction [RFEI/0401/0723].
However, rather than reply in a positive manner and address the fundamental problem identified by us
and issue the necessary design information, you informed us via letter ref: (10) that “The Contractor has
the required information and [was] clarified via the response of [sic] RFI/0401/15727.”
Consequently, the issue has not been addressed and therefore despite RFI/0401/15727 having been
raised and responded to by the Effective Date included in SAA8 (4 September 2018), the effects of delay
associated with this matter has not ceased but in fact has remained on-going since. This is why this
matter cannot possibly be construed as being deemed to be included within the ‘Contractor’s Settled
Claims’ (SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.7.2) and ‘Included Circumstances’ (per SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.7.4).
Yours faithfully,
