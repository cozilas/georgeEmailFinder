Subject Delay Notification - MTB External Works
Dear Sir,
We write to record the Contractor's failure to progress the MTB external works in order to meet the
target completion date of 28 Jun 2019 as per the baseline Programme Rev 11.2.
The Engineer has repetitively highlighted the MTB external works lack of progress, however, the
Contractor has not implemented any measures to mitigate their delays. The graph below
demonstrates the overall negative variance as of 25 May 2019.
The lack of management and coordination is evident as shown in the attached DAS external works KPI.
There has been no progress evidenced for over a month and no actions have been taken to recover
such delays.
The Contractor has been requested to submit their recovery plan, and detail how they intend to
complete the external works, and especially without interrupting ORAT trails. This plan was due on 02
June 2019.
We reserve the Employers' rights pursuant to Clause 10.3 of the Conditions of Contract for any delays
which may be caused to the operational trials (ORAT) and to the Project as a result of the Contractors'
inactions.
The Contractor is therefore requested to submit a recovery plan for the completion of the MTB
external works within one week upon receipt of this letter.
Yours faithfully,
