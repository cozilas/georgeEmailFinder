Dear Sir

Project: Subject:

Gold Line Underground
Sub-Clause 4.4 [Variation) - Prolongation of Services

Further to the design extending beyond the October 2015 end date specified within our Sub-Design
Contract, it was agreed that the prolongation of our services constitutes a Variation pursuant to SubClause
4.4
[Variations) of the Agreement and we were asked to submit our proposal for the adjustment of
our Fee.

In December 2015, after several meetings about the staff requirements for the review of the
outstanding design, we provided for your assessment our updated resource profile and additional fees
for the amount of QAR 9,569, 130.27 in relation to the extension of the Design review period up to the
end of June 2016.

In an endeavour to reach an agreement for the adjustment of our Fee, we had several discussions during
which we have addressed your concerns and provided all requested clarifications. In addition, we
accepted your argument that staff responsible for the review of the Lead Designer's Architectural BOH
design should not be included in this Variation since the same staff will also be used for the review of
the forthcoming DVE Contract for the verification of the Architectural FOH design.

Further to the above, we are writing to confirm that we agree with your proposal for the adjustment of
our Fee for the prolongation of our services up to the end of June 2016 for the amount of QAR
7,500,000.00.

The resource profile and additional fees are dependent on the following:
•
The extended period for Structural reviews is from the 1st November 2015 to the 24th June
2016,
•
The extended period for Tunnels reviews is from the 1st November 2015 to the 25th March
2016,
