Subject:Re: EOT & Prolongation Costs Assessment
Dear Sir,
Further to your letter referenced (6) above, which is in response to our letter reference (5), we hereby
set out our response accordingly.
We note your acknowledgment of our request to present audited accounts and your response that they
will be applied to the Emden Formula. We refer you to our letter reference (5) above, whereby we state
our position related to the calculation of head office overhead and add that the use of Emden Formula
in calculating head office overhead will not be considered by the Engineer and the Employer.
We also note your comment that Profit is recoverable as ‘any other costs’ or ‘damages’ and refer to SubClause 24.5.1 [Limitation of Liability] of the Subcontract in which it expressly states that neither party
shall be liable for any claims for loss of profit which maybe suffered by the other Party.
We are happy to discuss other issues related to your submission of Costs for EOT & prolongation but we
now consider the matters related to the calculation of head office overhead as closed.
Yours faithfully,
