Subject lack of Progress-Gatehouses
Dear Sir,
We write to express our concerns with regard to the lack of progress of the various trades in the Gate
houses and in particular the activities which have knock on effects on the substation energization and
Cause and Effect deadlines set for the Piers namely, Assa Abloy doors, Ceilings, Light Boxes and Fire
Hose Cabinets.
It is evident that the Contractor has not allocated the necessary supervisory resources to manage its
Subcontractors and coordinate the site activities.
We would like to remind you of the following milestones which are likely to be missed unless the
Contractor takes immediate action to resolve the site management issue and improve the
productivity and control on the Gate Houses:
Pier 4: Cause and Effect Start: 15 May 2018
• W3 Substation Zone - GHs 42, 43, 44 and 45 -Target Energization (Form 4 Submission) of EM
FOBs: 04 March 2018
• W2 Substation Zone - GHs 40 and 41 -Target Energization (Form 4 Submission) of EM FDBs:

• Wl Substation Zone - GHs 38 and 39 -Target Energization (Form 4 Submission) of EM FDBs:
13 March 2018
Pier 3: Cause and Effect Start: 06 July 2018
• 52 Substation Zone - GHs 22, 23, 33 and 34 -Target Energization (Form 4 Submission) of EM
FOBs: 28 Feb 2018 We request that you provide within 3 days from the date of receipt of this letter a
detailed plan for
the completion of all outstanding items in Piers 3 and 4 Gate Houses that are going to affect the
Energization Dates and Cause and Effect Milestones.
The Contractor is also requested to submit an organizational chart for the GH Management and
inform of the responsible Construction Manager for these works.
Yours faithfully,
