Subject:Clause 27.1.1: Notice of Claim – Delay Notice No. 236 [post-SAA8]
Suspension Notice: Training ‘On Hold’ – COVID-19
Dear Sirs,
On 24 March 2020 [12:24 PM] we received an e-mail from ADAC’s Training Operations Manager – ORAT,
informing us of the following:

‘Please be advised that the training programs for the 6.1 schedule and LSF, MTA, MTL and MTC carpark
are on hold effective from Wednesday, 25th of March 2020.
Due to the fluidity of the situation we are not a position to give a clear date on when training will recommence.’
Considering that ADAC’s instruction ordering a ‘hold’ to be placed on all training from 25 March 2020
until further notice is for all intents tantamount to a ‘Suspension Notice’, then we hereby notify you in
accordance with Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2, and 27.1.1, of our entitlement to claim:
(i)
An extension of the Time for Completion of the Works pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.9.1(a)
‘Consequence of Suspension’, or alternatively, Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c) ‘act of prevention’; and
(ii)
An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.2 pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.9
‘Consequence of Suspension’, or in the alternative, damages for breach of Contract.
Accordingly, interim and/or final details of the associated time impacts and adjustment to the Contract
Price will be provided in due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.5 (a), (b) and (c).
Yours faithfully,
