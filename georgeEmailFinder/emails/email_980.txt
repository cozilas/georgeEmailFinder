Subject RE: Additional Cost for Revision of Model Due to RC Wall Interface Detail &
Dear Sir,
Setting Out Issue Item-Planter (PS 24.1 & 24.2)
The Contractor confirms receipt of letter reference (1) wherein the Subcontractor requests an additional
payment of AED 8,400.00 in respect of the content of request for information {2). To be clear:
This request for information {RFI) was submitted in order to propose a solution to the constructability
issues being encountered by the Subcontractor to complete the planters' precast concrete cladding on
corners with small radius.
The Contractor notes that the Subcontractor's submission {1) does not provide any details in respect of
the level of development achieved on its BIM model when the RFI response was received. Neither does
this submission explain how the Subcontractor's BIM model was aborted considering that the precast
geometry of the planters remained unchanged.
Notwithstanding the above, please be reminded that the provisions of Clause 4.2.38 of Schedule 0
[Scope
of Subcontract Works] state that the Subcontractor 'is to allow for all design changes of a 'minor'
nature'.
The Contractor believes that the model update claimed by the Subcontractor derives from its request to
slightly update the detail of the corners to facilitate the constructabifity of the planters and, moreover, it
is of a minor nature. The Contractor is of the opinion that, unless demonstrated otherwise, the
Subcontractor should not be compensated for the model update included in its submission {1).
Yours faithfully,
