Executive Summary
Cloisall has submitted numerous revisions of their EOT & Prolongation Costs for the Ceilings and
Pavilions Package and a Claim for Disruption Events associated with the Ceilings package. Cloisall’s total
value of these Claims is in the amount of AED 80,940,007. Subsequently, after numerous meetings and
discussions, we have completed our assessment of the aforementioned Claims. TCA JV’s value ranges
between AED 46,210,378 and AED 53,160,575 of the said Claims depending on numerous variables
presented in detail below.
As an amicable settlement, Cloisall have verbally stated that they would accept AED 60m for EOT &
Prolongation Claims and Disruption events until 1st April 2018. It was also suggested by Cloisall, to deal
with all other events after 1st April 2018, on a pro-rata basis.
There is also an opportunity to settle a Claim from Cloisall for Rainwater Damages that is not included
within TCA JV’s above-mentioned assessment value. All details regarding the aforementioned are given
in detail, below.

Commercial Position

The Claims submitted by Cloisall for EOT & Prolongation are for events until 30th June 2017 and are
based on 100% costs compensated from 10th April 2018 until 31st December 2018. TCA JV’s assessment
is for events until 30 June 2017 and is based on 81.25% of costs compensated until 31st December 2018.

Cloisall says that in accordance with the Rev. 6.2 Programme the works were planned to be completed
by 11 March 2017 but at this date the works were only approximately 46% complete. During this period
therefore, Cloisall says that Staff was non-productive for 54% of this time (which Cloisall claims as the
percentage (%) of “Location” and “Task” Staff affected by the events causing delay to the critical path).
JV acknowledges that some portion of “Location” Staff (to be determined) may have been affected by
the events causing delay to the critical path but that “Task” Staff were not affected.
The 54% deficit claimed by Cloisall, assumes that Cloisall was 100% efficient during the period of 01
March 2015 to 11 March 2017 and that it was not liable for any of the shortfall in production. This is
unlikely to be true and so JV has to adduce evidence of how production may have negatively impacted
by events which are Cloisall’s risk e.g. availability of resources, efficiency of resources, mitigation
measures, weather etc. and propose an alternative percentage (%). In this regard it may be relevant to
note that if the ‘but-for’ method of delay analysis had been used in lieu of the ‘first-in-line’ method, then
the compensable delay for events occurring up to 30 June 2017 would have been 115 days i.e.
approximately 29% of the 394 days used in the valuation of Prolongation Cost. This implies that Cloisall
was culpable for 71% of the delay. If applied to the 54%, then the deficit for which JV may accept liability
would be 29% of 54% = 16%.
The two TCA JV options below are a minimum and a maximum liability, which depend on the percentage
(%) applied against the average daily rate for costs after 9th April 2018 until 31st December 2018 and
the value/percentage applied against the “Location” Staff. TCA JV’s assessment does not consider any
costs associated with “Task” Staff.
Ceilings - Disruption
Cloisall have submitted four (4) Disruption Claims totalling AED 28,769,980. TCA JV has responded to
each of Cloisall’s Claims requesting further substantiation and subsequently valuing the Claims as Nil.
TCA JV’s liability for this Claim is 15% of Cloisall’s submitted value in the amount of AED 4,311,197.
Rainwater Damage
Another Claim submitted by Cloisall that could be included as part of a financial settlement could be
Cloisall’s two (2) Rainwater Damage Claims in the amount of AED 4,862,230.99. TCA JV has responded
by email on numerous occasions requesting further substantiation in order to assess their submission.
TCA JV assessment is based on the removal of the existing ceiling and supply and installation of
replacement ceiling tiles including any necessary access equipment to be in the amount of AED
1,083,378.06
3.

Conclusion

Including our assessment of the Rainwater damage Claim, TCA JV’s maximum assessment value is in the
amount of AED 54,243,953.06. However, this is subject to recompensing only 15% of Cloisall’s claimed
value for Disruption events. Cloisall’s Claim is global in nature and is lacking the required substantiation
and does not provide enough information in order for us to complete a proper assessment at this stage.
The current value of our assessment is Nil based on the request to submit additional information;
nevertheless, we do not believe it would be Nil, if Cloisall were to submit a full and proper Claim based
on the requirements we have presented to them in our response letters.

Cloisall will also be unaware that the Rainwater damage Claims may form part of the amicable
settlement. The value of this, is subject to additional substantiation but if a financial settlement is being
introduced, then including this with a settlement figure could be worthwhile in order to settle another
Claim.
Yours faithfully,
