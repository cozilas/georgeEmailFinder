Dear Sir,

Further to its letter of reference 1) the Contractor encloses herewith all pending particulars forming the
basis of its conclusive valuation of 1:1 Mock-Up works as a whole.
Letter reference 1) had provided the Engineer’s Assistant with 1) a “Comprehensive Bill of Quantities of
all works involved”, “2) Evidence of all activities and related breakdown” and3) “Evidence of the
interrelation between the Bill of Quantities and the documents attached to the aforementioned
Contractor’s letter”.

Importantly, this submission enables a thorough audit of the Contractor’s expenditures to be
undertaken by the EA in the most effective and least time-consuming manner, namely, by means of
Appendix F – Proof of Payments – and it’s cross-referencing to all of the cost-summary appendices (save
from Appendix A – BoQ) whose valid copy is still to be found within letter reference 1)

The attachments to this letter further include the Contractor’s true and accurate representation of the
“total and certified costs to date” as requested by the EA. Those are to be found within Appendix F in
the following locations:

.

Overall Payment Summary

F / p.1

Summary of WO Payment status

F / p.2

Summary of PO Payment status F / p.176
Summary of HO Payment status F / p.245
Table 1: Index to Payment Summaries in Appendix F

In conclusion, the Contractor has gone over and above the EA’s valuation requirements of letter
reference 2) in an effort to facilitate conclusive review for the same. The Contractor can further be

called upon at any time should the EA so requires for the purpose of complying with its open-book
obligations under General Condition (“GC”) 13.7.2 of Volume 3 of the Contract.

Yours faithfully,
