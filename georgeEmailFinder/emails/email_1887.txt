Dear Sir,

We refer to letter reference 1) whereby you have provided details of the PEO Pedestrian Underpass
located near Souq Waqif Station for our information and reference, and requested us to assess the
potential impact to the Gold Line tunneling works.

We kindly inform you that the information provided is currently under assessment. Our detailed findings
will be submitted for your appraisal upon completion thereof. In any event, we would like to inform you
that the proposed PEO Pedestrian Underpass is intruding into the exclusion zone of the Gold Line
tunnel.

In accordance with the provisions of Volume 6 - Employer's Requirements - Design Specification, SubClause
4.4.1.4 [Definition of exclusion zones], "a) For third parties no structures shall be closer than 5 m
horizontally, 6 m vertically from the top and 3 m from the bottom of the outlined construction tolerance
zone. For planned structures intruding into this zone approvals from the Employer must be obtained."
[Emphasis added]

In this respect, you are kindly requested to liaise with the Employer and inform us whether approval for
the PEO Pedestrian Underpass intrusion into the exclusion zone can be obtained. If such approval will
not be obtained, the Engineer is kindly requested to issue the necessary instruction in accordance with
the provisions of the Contract.

Until we receive a clear direction with respect to the above, we will not be in the position to conclude
this interface as per the provisions of Volume 4 - Employer's Requirements - General, Clause 24
[Interface Management].

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.
Yours faithfully,
