Subject:Cracking of Block Walls to Basement Level LB1 between GH19 and GH20
Dear Sirs,
We write to inform you that cracks have been observed in inner blockwork walls to Basement Level LB1
between Gatehouse GH19 and GH20. While we cannot be sure as to the cause of the cracking at
present, we will nevertheless continue to closely monitor the situation on site and undertake further
investigations as appropriate and will advise you of our observations and findings in due course.
In a possibly connected matter, we have observed a significant rise in the groundwater level in the
vicinity of this basement area and have installed some monitoring equipment to allow us to assess the
situation for our own purposes.
Yours faithfully,
