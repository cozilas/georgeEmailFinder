Subject Clause 27.1.5(a) - Interim Particulars for the Basis of Claim Delay Notice No. 979 - Delays to AOS
- Scheduled, Non-Scheduled and Ad-Hoc Flights Workshop Stakeholders not in Agreement or Absent
from Workshop
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to the above correspondence (1) wherein the Contractor submitted the Interim
Particulars in relation to Delay Notice No. 979 issued via (3).
We record that the Contractor in correspondence (1) has not evidenced the impact of the alleged delay
to its programme and furthermore has not stated the implemented mitigation measures for the
avoidance of the alleged delay in accordance with the Programme Project Control Requirements (Clause
1.3.6). Furthermore, the Contractor has failed to submit a Time Impact Analysis as required under Clause
27 .2.1 of the Conditions of Contract.
The Engineer also records that the Contractor has failed to comply with the provisions of Clause 27.1.5
of the Conditions of Contract to submit full supporting particulars of the basis of the claim.
In light of the above, we consider that the Contractor has not substantiated any entitlement to an
Extension to the Time for Completion and we await for the full and final particulars to be submitted in
accordance with the Contract.
Yours faithfully,
