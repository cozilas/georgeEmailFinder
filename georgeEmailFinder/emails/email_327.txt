Subject: Cancellation of VO 380 (VEP-0401-066 Rev 01) Contractor's Value
Dear Sir,
Engineering Proposal-Inti II Roof Gutter Grating Omission
We refer to the above mentioned letter (1} informing us that " ... the Employer will no longer proceed
with the proposed Value Engineering and therefore the associated VO No. 380 is hereby rejected').
In this respect, we wish to clarify the following:
The Value Engineering proposal (VEP} was discussed in August 2018 with the representatives of
both Engineer and Employer. As these discussions pre-dated the effective date of Settlement
Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (SAA8}, the cost saving associated to this VEP was contemplated
for inclusion in SAA8 and captured under Clauses 1.7.2 and 1.7.4.
However, during the commercial meetings in October/November 2019 TCAJV was informed that
Engineer disagreed with TCAJV position and as no cost saving proposal was submitted before 4th
Sept 2018,we had to submit the VEP and provide the cost saving. Following these discussions) we
agreed to submit the VEP in November 20181
. Later, TCAJV and Engineer commercial teams had
subsequent meetings to reconcile the quantities and cost saving amount of AED 701,609.49 was
agreed in May 2019.
Following the VEP sign-off with the Engineer, TCAJV received the Variation order No. 380 via letter
(3} signed and stamped by the Engineer on 2nd June 2019, i.e seven months from the initial
submission. VO 380 was duly signed by a TCAJV Representative and returned via letter (2). Please
TCAJV complied and proceeded with immediate effect with the works instructed under the
Variation.
Subsequently, we issued a contractors instruction to TCAJV roofing Subcontractor Chadwick
Technology LLC.( Chadwick) to proceed with the works related to this Variation Order. Chadwick
immediately cancelled the procurement of remaining aluminium walkway gratings (not delivered to
site), placed the order of the safety life line and demobilised the skilled workers involved in the
installation of grating works and supporting staff.
In view of the above, Chadwick will need to initiate the procurement of aluminium walkway grating

by placing the order for raw material, fabrication and delivery that will take several months. Later,
mobilisation of skilled workers and staff will be required to start the installation works on site. This
will further have impact on the final WIR, as-built drawings and close-out document submissions.
Cancellation of the V0.380 at this stage of the project will have significant cost and time implication
on the completion of overall Project, for which we will of course seek to be compensated financially
and with an Extension of Time. We therefore request you to reconsider your position and avoid any
further cost and time delays.
Yours faithfully,
