Dear Sir,
Engineer's Assistant's letter reference 4) specifically reminded the Contractor to advise of the effect (if
any) of the proposed Variation on the Time for Completion and the programme, pursuant to Sub-Clause
13.2.2
(c) of the General Conditions of Contract. The Contractor has repeatedly failed to submit the required
information.

This direction is considered critical, therefore the Contractor shall submit the outstanding information
no later than five (5) days from receipt of this letter.

Contractor's failure to respond by the revised date will be construed by the Engineer's Assistant as
confirm tion by the Contractor that there is no time impact associated with this direction.

Yours faithfully,
