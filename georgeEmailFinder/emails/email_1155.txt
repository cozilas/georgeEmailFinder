Subject: Notice to Improve Subcontractors Performance
Dear Sir,
We hereby write to raise our concerns at your current performance in carrying out the Works. In
particular we highlight the following issues.
• Lack of onsite Site Management- We have raised this issue with you on numerous occasions and again
raise our concern that the Works are being managed remotely.
• Inexperienced Site Staff - The present site engineers are failing to supervise the works in accordance
with the current requirements. Your site labour force is reliant on the Contractor's guidance.
• Lack of Planning- Despite previously requesting the Subcontractor in late 2017, as yet you have failed
to provide a clear and trackable completion plan which can be followed.
• QA/QC- WIR progress is insufficient due to the lack of QA/QC management
Therefore, we hereby serve notice on the Subcontractor to rectify its performance with immediate
effect.
You are hereby instructed to submit your action plan to address the above concerns within seven (7)
days of receipt of this letter.

Yours faithfully,
