Subject:Subsidence Rectification Programme â€“ CIPP Lining to Sewer Pipeline
Delayed Receipt of Instructions for Pier 4 Scope of Works
Dear Sir,
We refer to your letter ref: (1) the content of your subsequent e-mail ref: (2) and letter ref: (3).
Your letter ref: (1) instructed is to procure the CIPP relining system and on the basis of this instruction
we directed Applusvelosi to order the material. This has a very limited shelf life of six months. Your
letter also directed us to undertake the re-lining to Pier 4 yet the full scope of works including grouting,
together with the preferred sequence of works, at that point (i.e. 8 May 2019) had yet to finalized and
agreed
We have since agreed between us to grout under the pipes before lining despite your earlier e-mail (ref:
2) suggesting otherwise. However, you have only just issued letter ref: (3) enclosing EI No. 773B that

instructs the full scope of sewer and storm water rectification works, albeit again limited to Pier 4, which
is ten weeks after we were first instructed to order the CIPP lining system for the Project.
Not only are we concerned about the delay in issuing instructions and the effect this will have on the
sewer rectification works to Pier 4, but we are also concerned that if you similarly delay issuing us
instructions defining the scope of rectification works for the remaining piers, then not only will this
further prolong the rectification works generally, but we run the risk that the CIPP materials ordered for
Piers 1 to 3 will become scrap given their limited shelf life. As explained to you during the Risk
Management Meeting on 14 July 2019, we are also concerned about the sequence in which the work is
required to be undertaken and maintain that it is better to reline the pipeline first and then grout as the
unlined pipe is more prone to damage due to an upheave in pressure because of the grouting. Hence we
will not accept any responsibility for any resultant damage caused to the sewer pipeline.
Yours faithfully,
