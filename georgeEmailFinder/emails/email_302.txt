Subject Wet Weather Plan for Subsidence Works
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence (1), pertaining to the above mentioned subject. The
Engineer notes the lack of detail in the Contractor's assessment and mitigation strategy and hereby
provides the following points in response to the Contractor's proposal:
• The Contractor shall clearly identify and indicate where all of the MTB roof water will safely
discharge without impacting the open excavations. Many of the flexible hoses installed to date
have been damaged and/or badly jointed, which could result in water discharging to the
excavation/ground level;
• The Contractor shall identify how the existing and forthcoming excavations will be
safeguarded against potential collapse in the event of water ingress;
• The Contractor shall clearly specify and highlight what measures will be taken to prevent
surface water from entering the open excavations;
• The Contractor shall assess the risk to undermining temporary works installed in terms of
slippage/collapse and consequential damage to live utilities;
• The Contractor shall indicate their strategy for pumping out/dewatering in the event that
water enters excavated zones;
• The Contractor shall close off all open interfaces into the building to avoid water ingress;
• All temporary electrical installations are to be protected to safeguard against
damage/electrical safety hazards;
• The Contractor shall ensure that there are no any blocked discharge outlets from the building

that could accumulate water and back into the building;
• The Contractor is also aware of the impact that water inundation can impact on the
collapsibility of the soil matrix, and will be held culpable for any/all damages consequent to
their failure to adequately protect their Works.
We trust that the Contractor will provide its urgent attention to all of the above points in order to
adequately safeguard against any negative impacts that may result from potential future rainfall for
the duration of the subsidence rectification works.
Yours faithfully,
