Dear Sir,
Engineer's Assistant refers to letter reference 2), where in the Contractor was directed to submit a
quotation for any cost and time impact. The Contractor's response was due by 23 August 2016, but to
date the Contractor has not responded.

Further to letter reference 1). the Contractor's delay in providing the quotation is preventing the
Engineer from making an informed decision under the Sub-Clause 13.2.3.

The Contractor is directed to provide the quotation without any further delay.
Yours faithfully,
