ANNEX A
Description of the Event
We write to notify you of our concerns in relation to the receipt on 22 October 2019 of the following
comments detailed within Non-Conformance Report (NCR) No: MTC-CMA-0401-CM-NCR-01462 (ref: 1),
associated with a purported non-conformance, namely: ‘Gaps between Type-3 Glass Down Stand and
GRC Ceiling’ located below the RCP Artwork void at CP Level 2 (refer to Figure 1 below).
Figure 1
It is alleged that the gaps between Type-3 Glass Down-Stand and GRC Ceiling do not comply with
approved Shop Drawings and that the brackets within the gaps are visible from below. Attached to NCR01462 were a series of photos. A further photo [not attached] is reproduced in Figure 2 below;
Figure 2
The issue subject to NCR-01462 was originally detailed in Site Memo No: MTC-CMA-0401-QC-MEM02713 received on 17 January 2018, but as noted your subsequent comments issued to us on 18 January
2019, “This Site Memo is converted to NCR (MTC-CMA-0401-CM-NCR-01462).” We note that NCR-01462
formalising the alleged non-conformance was not issued to us until 22 October 2019.
Attached to NCR-01462 is the following:
•
A series of seven (7) photos showing the gaps between Type-3 glass and GRC ceiling located
below the RCP Artwork void at CP Level 2 (refer to Figure 3 for indicative examples);
•
Extracts from Shop Drawing No: 401-AG-A-03-20-5.17C-GS-SD-001-Rev 03 ‘Type 3 Glass Down
Stand Partial Plan & Section Level 2.0 Sector 5.17C’, classified Code 2 ‘Exemptions As Noted Revise &
Resubmit For Record’ of Details 3, 4 and 5 (Figure 4 refers); and
•
Extract of Details 1 and 2 from Shop Drawing No: 401-AG-A-08-00-0.00-GS-SD-054-Rev 01 ‘Type
3 Glass Down-Stand Vertical Details’, which was approved Code 2 (Figure 5 refers).

(Type 3 Glass Down Stand)
Figure 5 – Shop Drawing No: 401-AG-A-08-00-0.00-GS-SD-054-Rev 01
(Type 3 Glass Down Stand Vertical Details)
We note that in NCR-01462 you advise us of “the gap between glass Type-3 Down stand (GLZ-11)” and
at the same time you state that the “GRC ceiling does not comply with approved shopdrawing”.
However, what you failed to state is that the particular “Shop Drawing” you are referring to, is the two
Shop Drawings mentioned above, which relate to the Composite Cladding and Internal Glazing only
(executed by M/s Al Ghurair) and not the GRC ceiling works (executed by M/s Gulf Pre-Cast).
This is evident from Details 3, 4 and 5 of Shop Drawing No: 401-AG-A-03-20-5.17C-GS-SD-001-Rev 03
(Figure 4), enlarged extracts of which are reproduced in Figure 6 below, where each of the typical

sections state that “GRC PANELS BY OTHERS/TCAJV”. Consequently, the works related to GRC ceiling
panels, do not form part of the two Shop Drawings referenced in NCR-01462 (Figure 4 and Figure 5).
Figure 6
In which case, your comment alleging that the “GRC ceiling does not comply with approved
shopdrawing”, is misleading since the GRC Ceiling Shop Drawings are prepared separately and the
related works associated with the actual GRC ceiling panels subject to the NCR [executed by M/s Gulf
Precast] are subject to other Shop Drawings. Accordingly, the GRC ceiling panels have actually been
constructed as per GRC Ceiling Shop Drawing No: 401-GP-A-06-TP-5.00-PRB-SD-1866-Rev 02 (Figure 7
refers), which has been prepared, submitted and approved with Status Code 2 via email (attached to
Annex B hereto), dated 22 November 2015 [Sunday 2:32 PM].
Figure 7 – Shop Drawing No: 401-GP-A-06-TP-5.00-PRB-SD-1866-Rev 02
(GRC Ceiling Panels)
In this regard, it is worth noting that the GRC Ceiling Panel Shop Drawing (Figure 7 refers) has been
prepared based upon and adheres to IFC Drawing No: MTC-A-51-TB-L_._-_._-00.118-V00, ‘GLASSSCREEN-ART-WORK-VOID-SET-OUT,-TYPE-3’ (Figure 8 refers).
Figure 8 – IFC Drawing No: MTC-A-51-TB-L_._-_._-00.118-V00
(Glass Screen Art Work Void Set Out)
In addition, the Section Details (‘Section Detail 2 & 3’) in IFC Drawing No: MTC-A-51-TB-L_._-_._-00.118V00 (Figure 8), in fact specify voids between the suspended Type 3 glass Down Stand and GRC ceiling
panels. The void indicated in Section Details 2 & 3 of the said IFC Drawing, can be clearly seen and is
highlighted in Figure 9 below. Essentially, the IFC Design indicates that that such voids or gaps will in
fact exist between the suspended Type 3 glass down stand and GRC ceiling panels, due to the geometry
and the distribution of each element installed as per the Design. Simply, some locations between the
Type 3 glass down stand and GRC ceiling will consist of voids and some will not, and this is a result of the
Design provided by you. Accordingly, this addresses and responds to your NCR ref: (1) comments
wherein you stated that “The size of the gap is varying from no gap to a large gap.”
Moreover, the GRC ceiling panel width is at 775mm and does not change throughout the perimeter of
the GRC ceiling panels placed around and under the L10 RCP artwork, which are installed next to the
suspended glass down-stand below the highest point of the GRC. As a result shopdrawing ref: 401-GP-A06-TP-5.00-PRB-SD-1866-Rev 02 for the GRC ceiling panels (Figure 7 refers), has been prepared in the
same manner keeping the width of the GRC ceiling panels at 775mm as shown in Figure 10 below.
Moreover, as per ‘Section Detail 2’ (Figure 9 refers) of the IFC Drawing, the brackets are exposed and
visible and no additional closure is indicated to be installed thereto.

Sections 1-1 & 2-2,
Moreover, the approved Shop Drawing No: 401-GP-A-06-TP-5.00-PRB-SD-1866-Rev 02 Section AA & BB,
provides the scallops’ details, with the levels, i.e. levels’ differences from edge point to the middle point,
the dimensions to each point of the sloped scallops respectively, the scallops’ geometry etc. as shown in
Figure 11 below.

Sections A-A & B-B

In effect, when combining all the information provided in the IFC Drawings and the approved Shop
Drawings, considering the specified size of the glass down stands and the GRC ceiling panels, together
with the geometry and the level differences of the scallops, then after combining all these elements
together, it results in various gaps between the suspended glazing and the GRC ceiling panels.
In summary therefore, based on the foregoing analysis, it is evidently clear that the gaps mentioned in
your NCR comments, are a result of combining all these dimensions, sizes and geometries as indicated in
the Design Intent, the Design, IFC Drawings and Shop Drawings, as outlined above.
On this basis, we consider your comments annotated upon in NCR-01462 to be both unreasonable and
misleading; and therefore in consideration that the said Works have been constructed as per the
approved Design, then we kindly request you to close out NCR-01462 as soon as possible.
We note at present it remains unclear from the NCR comments whether or not you wish to instigate any
changes to the existing design and our Work scope. If this is indeed the case, and you wish to modify the
design, this will require a valid Engineer’s Instruction (EI) and a Variation Order (VO).
In which case, as you know, SAA8 laid down strict guidelines to follow if additional works are required
and this appears to have been ignored. We therefore take this opportunity in reminding you of the
provisions of Clauses 2.29 to 2.31 of SAA8 pertaining to Variations, in so far as we are not to proceed
with any Variation unless a Variation Order and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. In which
respect, it is your obligation to issue this Record first if you wish to instigate any change; and this is only
after the additional time and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.
Despite this event having it origins in 2018 [as noted above], we wish to make it clear that its cannot
possibly be construed as forming part of or ‘Included Circumstances’ (per Clause 1.7.4 of SAA8) and will
be included within any forthcoming Time Impact Analysis, albeit in recognition of the Effective Date
included in SAA8, any delays will be analysed from 4 September 2018 onwards. SAA8 cannot reasonably
be interpreted as requiring the Contractor to absorb delays of unknown (possibly unlimited) duration
occurring pre/post 4 September 2018, particularly where the resolution of the matter causing the delay
lies with the Employer. We contend therefore that under the circumstances the responsibility, under
the Contract (as amended by SAA8), for such delays lies with the Employer.
Yours faithfully,
