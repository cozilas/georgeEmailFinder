Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to letter reference 1) whereby the Engineer's Assistant has requested a quotation
for recalculation of metro chainage in accordance with the new alignment baseline for incorporation in
the as-built drawings. The Contractor has assessed the information provided by the Engineer's Assistant
and hereby confirms that the incorporation of the changes in the as-built drawings shall have no cost
and time impact to the Employer. However if the recalculation are to be incorporated before the as-built
stage such as shop drawings, Issued for construction drawings, etc, then the Contractor reserves its
rights under the Contract.

Yours faithfully,
