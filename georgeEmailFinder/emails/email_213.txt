Subject MTB Chilled Water Piping Rectification Works Due to Settlement of External CHW
Piping-Request for an Engineer's Instruction
Dear Sir,

We write with reference to correspondence (1) in relation to the above subject and we note that an
Engineer's Instruction is not required to be issued as according to Clause 3.1 C of Section 017700 of
the Specification it is the Contractor's responsibility to rectify any defect in the system and ensure that
all the systems and equipment are maintained properly.
Further, we highlight that the Contractor has neither investigated the root cause nor provided any
substantial evidence to prove that the leakage was caused due to subsidence around the external pipe
installed by the Other Contractor as stated in correspondence (1). The Engineer has previously
requested the Contractor to excavate the external area where the thrust block has been installed and
to carry out a survey to assess any possible settlement in the installed external CHW network,
however, the Contractor has not proceeded accordingly.
With regard to the lay-up chemical, and as you are aware, this had to be added based on the
recommendation of the specialist water treatment company employed by ADAC/DCP as a preventive
measure. This was introduced to avoid any possible contamination of the entire MTB/DCP CHW
network that would lead to a full system flushing and indirectly impacting the cooling to the MTB
building. Until such time the Contractor evidences that they are not responsible for the defect, the
Contractor shall be responsible for the cost associated with the rectification. The quantity of chemical
to be added has been reduced based on the several discussions ADAC/CMA/CxA and the DCP
Contractor had with M/s. Cooltech.
Currently, the rectifi cation works for the leaking BTU meters have been completed successfully;
however should any subsequent defects manifest as a result of exte rnal subsidence, the Cont ract or
remains responsible to address any defective ground and infrastructure supported thereon and at
their own cost.
Yours faithfully,
