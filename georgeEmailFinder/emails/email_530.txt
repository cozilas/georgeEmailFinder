Subject Recovery of Overhead, Profit and Attendance due to the Omission of Defined
Provisional Sum for Hotel Fit Out
Cross Ref.
Dear Sir,
(1} MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/011852 dated OS November 2017
(2) MTC-CMA-TCA-0401-LTR-08073 dated 22 October 2017
We write with reference to correspondence (1} regarding the recovery of Overhead, Profit and
Attendance due to the Omission of the Defined Provisional Sum for Hotel Fit Out.
The Engineer reiterates its contractual position conveyed to the Contractor vide correspondence (2).
Furthermore the Contractor is referred to Clause 9.5 (Schedule 1, Contract Particula rs) wherein is
provided that the Contract shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
Emirate of Abu Dhabi and the federa l laws of the United Arab Emirates.
We note the Contractor's request for a meeting to discuss "the dispute" and we record that the
Contractor has not submitted a Claim in accordance with the Contract regarding this matter and also, in
the last paragraph of correspondence (1), the Contractor erroneously refers to letter (ref.
MTB/TCA/ AECOM/L/011503) which is not related to the Omission of the Defined Provisional Sum for
the
Hotel Fit Out.
In light of the above, the Engineer believes the requirements of the Contract are explicit.
Yours faithfully,
