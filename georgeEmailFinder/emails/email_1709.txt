Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to the Engineer’s letter reference 1) wherein the Engineer requested the
Contractor to provide further substantiation for the 80:20 split proposed via letter reference 2) for
backfilling the sides and top of the Stations.

The Contractor has therefore analyzed the productivities of the backfilling on the sides and the top of
the Stations on the basis of actual progress recorded for Sport City Switchbox.

The analysis is based on the activities 092G1070A1, -A2, -B1, -B2 and -C1 which correspond to the
backfilling up to the roof level. The combined productivity of aforementioned activities is then
compared to the activity 092G4070- which reflects the backfilling above roof level. The relevant extract
from the CMP dated 13 April 2017 is enclosed in attachment 1) to this letter.

The results of the productivity analysis are summarized in the table below, the details of the calculation
are enclosed in attachment 2) to this letter:

Backfilling level Productivity (m3/d)
Up to Roof

110

87%

Above Roof

728

13%

Cost Distribution

With an 87:13 weighting based on actual productivities the above analysis yields a split of the backfilling
milestones in excess of the 80:20 split proposed by the Contractor via letter reference 2).

The Contractor kindly requests the Engineer to review the Contractor’s proposal of reference 2) and
provide comments at the earliest.

Yours faithfully,
