Dear Sir,
We hereby enclosed an updated list of back charges along with the supporting documents on CD for
your review.
In pursuant to the Conditions of Subcontract Agreement Clause 10.3 (Contractorâ€™s Claims), we hereby
confirm our entitlement to deduct such amounts but not limited to enclosed, from your interim
payments accordingly. The basis of these charges are mainly derived either from your request, or we

have supplied materials and services on your behalf in connection with your Subcontract Works which
form part of your obligations and responsibilities. In addition, we shall back charge any amount that falls
under your responsibility in accordance to Clause 12.12.4 (Other Contractors and Other Subcontractors),
whereby you are liable to the Contractor for any claim by the Employer, other Contractors or other
Subcontractors for the costs arising out of your failure to perform the obligations under the Subcontract.
This is for your information and record.
Yours faithfully,
