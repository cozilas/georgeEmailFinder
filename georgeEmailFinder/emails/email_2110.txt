Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer's Assistant's letters referenced 1 and 2 above concerning the change to the
requirement for travelators (moving walkways), the Contractor would like to confirm that there will be
no cost or time savings associated with civil works. This is due to the requirement to allow for the
structure to include for the installation of travelators by others, at a later date. This requirement will
also require the Contractor to make provision for items such as electricity supply through the Provisional
Sums.

There will however be a reduction in the scope of works through the Provisional Sums associated with
the actual supply and installation of travelators, with 4nr no longer being required due to the new
requirements. As the travelators are being centrally procured by Qatar Rail as part of package 1O
"Elevators, Escalators & Travelators", the Contractor does not have visibility as to what the cost (and
therefore saving) of these travelators would be.

Yours faithfully,
