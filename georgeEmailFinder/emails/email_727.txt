Material Delivery Schedule

Dear Sir,
We hereby request you provide a detailed procurement schedule for all outstanding material deliveries.
The schedule should detail quantities of current materials on site (MOS), the current status of the
material orders and their anticipated delivery to site. It is advised that you liaise with the Construction
Team ahead of submission in order to determine prioritised areas for the forthcoming 6-8 weeks. This
will enable ASP and TCAJV to take a proactive approach to tracking and updating the status of your
procurement, fabrication and delivery of materials.
Please submit your schedule within 3 days after receipt of this request.

This is for your information, records and further necessary action.
Yours faithfully,
