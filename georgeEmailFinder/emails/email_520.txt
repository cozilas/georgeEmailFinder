CP L0.1 Mezzanine Expansion joint profile

Dear Sir,
We are in receipt of your letter referenced (1) wherein you alleged that the expansion joint EXP-02 at CP
level 0.1 is additional to your scope of works and requested a Contractor’s Instruction.
Please note that detail 3 in IFC A-81-702 and detail A1 in A-81-502 show in sections the expansion joint
cover assembly in the exact same location where it occurs in the cross referenced part plans IFC A-81413 and A-81-415. Also, IFC A-81-413 defines the subject expansion joint cover as “Interior-Floor
expansion joint cover assembly type*EXP”. The aforementioned part plans do not provide the expansion
join type, however, in accordance with the IFC design Specification section 079500 [Expansion Control],
throughout the project in Front of House (public) areas, wherever an expansion join cover in Floor to
Floor connections occurs, the expansion joint cover is type EXP-02.
In addition to the above, the fact that the expansion joint cover type was not given in the IFC, although it
was defined as an expansion joint in IFC-A81-413, is covered by the Specification section 079500
[Expansion Control] Paragraph 1.4 A2 (PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS) “As scope and performance
documents, the Drawings and Specifications do not necessarily indicate or describe in detail all work
required for the full performance and completion of the Works. Contractor is responsible for developing
and completing the design in accordance with the Contract Documents, and shall provide all items
required for proper completion of the Works without adjustment to the Contract price”.
In view of the above, it is clear that the mentioned works do not introduce any design change, neither a
new type of expansion joint, hence are not considered to be additional to your scope of works.

You are hereby reminded that any delays, costs, claims, losses and/or expenses and the like incurred by
us arising as a result of your failure to complete the aforementioned activities in a timely manner, will be
solely your responsibility as per the Subcontract Agreement Clauses including but not limited to 10.3
[Contractor’s Claims], 12.12.4 [Other Contractors and Other Subcontractors] and 16.6 [Delay Damages]
We consider the matter closed and instruct you to proceed with the works without any further delay.
Yours faithfully,
