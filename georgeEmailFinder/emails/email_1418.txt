Dear Sir,

Reference is made to the Engineer's Instruction No. 53 at reference 1 above.
The Contractor considers that this Engineer's Instruction constitutes a Variation under Clause 13 of the
General Conditions of Contract.

This letter therefore serves as the Contractor 's notice under Sub-Clauses 3.3.3, 8.4.2 and 20 .1.2 of the
General Conditions of Volume 3 of the Contract that due to said Engineer's Instruction the Contractor
considers itself to be entitled to:

(1)
an extension to the Time for Completion pursuant to, inter alia, Sub-Clauses 8.4.1(a), {b) and (c)
of the General Conditions, and
(2)
to additional payment pursuant to, inter alia, Sub-Clause 13.6.1 of the General Conditions. Such
Entitlement is also provided by the Qatar Civil Code (Law No 22 of 2004).
The Contractor is currently investigating the impact that the said Instruction may have on the Time for
Completion. Should there be an impact to same, the Contractor will, in accordance with Sub-Clause
20.1.6 of the General Conditions of Contract, endeavour to provide within 28 days of this claim notice,
its fully detailed claim including full supporting particulars of the basis of the claim for the claimed
extension to the Time for Completion and additional payment. The fully detailed claim will also include
the Contractor's Time Impact Analysis for the adjustment to the Time for Completion pursuant to SubClause 8.4.4 of the General Conditions of Contract.
Yours faithfully,
