Subject: Concurrent Delays of Fire Sealant in L0.1
Dear Sir,

You are instructed to expedite the process with due expectation.

mitigation measures necessary to remedy I rectify this situation caused by your reluctance to comply
with
your contractual obligations of which we find you completely culpable.

completely culpable for all costs and/or delays incurred and the same will be levied against your account

raised within this letter, please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned.
