Subject: Engineers Instruction No. 662 – Omission of Stone Floor Tile Installation at L3.0 Hotel Building
Terrace
Dear Sir,

With regards to the above subject, we acknowledge receipt of your letter reference (1) requesting us to
confirm whether the re-instatement of these works will have neutral Time and Cost Impacts.
Please be informed that in our submitted letter reference (3) for the Stone Floor Finish, the changes
seen on the Quantities of the revised BoQ rates, have been quantified up to Bulletin 103.1 and the rates
have been adjusted accordingly but are subject to agreement/approval.
Upon reviewing the stone floor tile requirements at L3.0, we confirm the following:
•
Cost - Included in the revised BoQ but subject to agreement/approval;
•
Time – We confirm that there will be no time impact, as long as the Engineer provides the
formal instruction to reinstate the works by the end of June 2018.
We trust the above meets your approval and clarifies the matter; however, should you require any
further information, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Yours faithfully,
