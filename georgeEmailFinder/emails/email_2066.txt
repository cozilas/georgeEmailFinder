Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to the minutes of meeting of reference 1) attended by representatives from the
Systems Contractor, the Engineer’s Assistant, the Employer and the Contractor in connection to
telecommunication interface matters such as telecom equipment integration to architectural finishes

and access control system requirements. In particular, the Contractor refers to the post meeting note of
item no.1 “Telecom Equipment Integration to Architectural Finishes” which states: “The provision of the
totem is neither in ALYSJ’s or MSI’s scope. An instruction will be required from the Employer [sic] for
providing the totem”. Irrespective of whether the Engineer issues the aforementioned instruction to the
Contractor or the System’s Contractor, the Contractor has nevertheless identified yet another scope gap
which unless addressed by the Engineer’s Assistant in a timely manner may classify as a probable future
event or circumstance pursuant to the provisions of Clause 8.3.7 of Volume 3 of the Contract.

Yours faithfully,
