Dear Sir,

With reference to Engineer’s Assistant’s Letter Ref (1) above, the Contractor hereby submits a proposal
to revise the milestone payment schedules as detailed in Volume 2 Part 7 Clause 9.2.1 of the
Commercial Proposal.

This proposal is only for Passenger Access Walkway Milestones and is in line with the agreed method to
split these Milestones.

The Contractor requests that this proposal is given urgent consideration (In IPA 23) to help with the
Project's Cash Flow.

We are available to attend meetings and provide any further clarification required.

Yours faithfully
