RE: Amendment Agreement No.3-For On Account Monthly Advance Payment

Dear Sir,
We are in receipt of your letter reference (2) above, whereby you appear to show a disapproval of our
“Monthly Advance Payment” forwarded to you via our letter reference (1) above. After reviewing your
mentioned letter, we would like to express our regret to the content thereunder.
As a gesture of goodwill, we have proceeded with the said “Monthly Advance Payments”, in an effort to
assist you financially. At this juncture, we must emphasize that these payments have no correlation with
your prolongation cost submissions and these two things should be dealt independently.
Taking this opportunity, you are reminded that we have audited your prolongation cost submissions and
have forwarded the same to the Engineer for their determination, in line with the Subcontract
Agreement. Please be informed that the Contractors Determination you seek related to the
Prolongation Cost and Extension of Time is subject to the Engineer’s Assessment and Determination
pursuant to Clauses 11.4.3 and 11.4.4 [Determinations] of the Subcontract.
In regards to your comment about a potential dispute, it is your prerogative to issue a dispute notice
and follow the arbitration route. The Subcontract Agreement is clear as to the procedures in place which
need to be adhered to and implemented prior to any issuance of a Dispute Notice and under which
circumstances it can be issued. Thus, in the event of any potential dispute in relation to the foregoing,

resolution of the same will be in strict accordance with that of Clause 27.3 [Dispute Resolution] which
forms an integral part of the Subcontract Agreement between us.
We hope that the above clarifies our position in the matter.
Yours faithfully,
