Subject:Post SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0117
Additional Works associated with the Installation of Antennas to Piers 1 to 4 by an Other Contractor –
Request for Engineer’s Instruction / Variation Order
Dear Sir
We refer to your letter ref (2) issued in response to our letter ref: (1).
We note your comment where on the one hand you state the Employer’s Other Contractor (COMBA
Telecom) “has confirmed that there are no additional cuttings / openings required” yet on the other
hand you direct us to “proceed with the additional works instructed under EI 748” but at the same time,
inform us that “there is no entitlement for a Variation Order” and that the E-Notice is “closed”.
For the reasons comprehensively set out in E-Notice No 0117 issued by way of our letter ref: (1), “the
additional works” we are expected to undertake to provide purported ‘logistical support’ to COMBA

Telecom is grossly in excess of that originally promulgated in EI No. 748 and constitutes work that is
indeed “additional” to our existing scope. Hence we requested an EI / VO in order for us to proceed.
Since our letter ref: (1) was issued, which was on 5 August 2019, and absent receipt of an EI / VO, we
have demobilised the resources that would have otherwise been available, and are now no longer in a
position to undertake the additional works for the Employer’s Other Contractor (COMBA Telecom).
We take this further opportunity in reminding you that if in the event you require additional works to be
undertaken by us, then there is a mechanism under the provisions of Clause 2.29 to Clause 2.31 of SAA8
available to you if you so wish; we are not obligated to act otherwise unless you instruct us.
Yours faithfully,
