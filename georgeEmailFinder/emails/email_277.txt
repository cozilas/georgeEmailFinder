Typical Conduit Installations for Electrical and Telecom Rooms - Unreasonable Response RFI/0401/17292
and SDS/0401/E/1141 (Rev. 00 and Rev. 01)
Dear Sirs,
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview

The matters described in Annex A concern delays to the Works due to your unreasonable comments in
response to RFI/0401/17292 and SDS/0401/E/1141 (both Rev. 00 and Rev. 01), associated with the
installation of Electric Metallic Tube Conduits installed below 2400mm not subject to severe damage.
Potential Impact
Delays and disruption due to the events and circumstances outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
likely to impact on the achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delays and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned immediately upon receipt of this e-notice.
Nevertheless, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
On 14 July 2019, we submitted RFI/0401/17292 Rev. 00, entitled ‘FMR Conduits in Areas Not Exposed to
Mechanical Damage’, seeking confirmation from you as to our intended use of Electrical Metallic Tubing
(EMT) conduit that would not be exposed to physical damage below 2400mm from finished floor level
(FFL), to electrical and telecom rooms; namely: Electrical Closet Rooms (ECR), Data Centres (DC), Main
Communication Rooms (MCR), Satellite Communication Rooms (SCR), and Telecommunication Rooms.
Specifically, within RFI/0401/17292 Rev. 00 we advised you of the following:
“With reference to specification 260533 clauses 4.a through 4.e, the exposed conduits subject to severe
physical damage below 2400mm from FFL are required to be Rigid Steel for the below listed areas:
a. Loading dock.
b. Corridors used for traffic of mechanized carts, fork lifts and pallet handling units.
c. Mechanical rooms.
d. Utilidors.
e. Corridors, areaways for luggage carts...”
In light of the above, contractor provided normal EMT conduits for the electrical and telecom rooms as
they are not list [sic] in above spec clause. See attached sketch …”
Specification Section 260533 governs ‘Raceways and Boxes for Electrical Systems’ and in particular,
Clause 3.1 identifies the ‘Execution’ of ‘Raceway Application’, where item B in particular sets out the
conduit requirements for indoor conditions and the specific type of conduit required in situations where
they are exposed to inter alia severe physical damage or not (Figure 1 below refers);
Figure 1 – Extract from Specification Section 260533
Clause 3.1.B [‘Execution’ of ‘Raceway Application’]
In other words, in RFI/0401/17292 Rev. 00 we advised you that for the electrical and telecom rooms that
would not be subject to severe physical damage below 2400mm from FFL, we had provided ‘normal’
EMT conduits (thus complying with the requirements of Specification Section 260533 Clause 3.1.B.3 (see
Figure 1 above) and simply asked for your confirmation that this was acceptable.
In addition to attaching an extract of Specification Section 260533 Clause 3.1.B to RFI/0401/17292 Rev.
00, we also attached the following sketch (Figure 2 refers). However, the manner in which the sketch
was structured / worded gave the impression that this sketch represented a typical conduit [EMT]
installation scenario in situations where the conduits are ‘Exposed and subject to severe physical
damage below 2400mm’, despite us mentioning rigid steel conduit immediately thereafter. What we
meant to state was that this was representative of situations where the conduits are not ‘Exposed and

subject to severe physical damage below 2400mm’ and that EMT conduits would be used, and in
situations where the conduits are ‘Exposed and subject to severe physical damage below 2400mm’, then
rigid steel conduit would be installed [all as per Specification 260533 Clause 3.1.B].

[Note misleading wording circled in red]
In the event however, despite us requesting a response to RFI/0401/17292 Rev. 00 by 22 July 2019, you
failed to reply until 15 calendar days later i.e. on 6 August 2019. However, irrespective of the foregoing,
the Employer’s Design Consultant’s comments reflected a fundamental misunderstanding of what was
being asked / requested by us [these comments are reproduced in Figure 3 below]:
Figure 3 – Response to RFI/0401/17292 Rev. 00
Employer’s Design Consultant’s Comments
As the Employer’s Design Consultant had correctly pointed out, the approved Shop Drawing No. 401-ANE-07-GE-0.00-SP-SD-003 Rev. 00 [submitted on 16 February 2014 under SDS/0401/E/0214 Rev. 00, and
returned Status Code 2 on 26 February 2014] was for Rigid Steel Conduit (RSC) for areas that are
exposed and subject to damage below 2400mm.
We wish to make it clear that we were not requesting any modifications to remedy an alleged “defects”
nor were we deviating from approved shop drawings, as alleged. As noted, we advised you we had
installed EMT conduit in the electrical and telecom rooms – in accordance with Specification Section
260533 Clause 3.1.B.3 – because they were not subject to severe damage and simply asked for
“confirmation” [this was expressly stated in RFI/0401/17292 Rev. 00] that this was acceptable.
Shortly thereafter, on 14 August 2019, we submitted Shop Drawing Submittal No. SDS/0401/E/1141 Rev.
00 seeking your approval of Shop Drawing No. 401-An-E-E07-GE-0.00-SP-SD-050 Rev. 00 ‘Typical Conduit
Installation for EC Rooms, MCR Rooms, SCR Rooms, TC Rooms (Surface Mounted). Note: the
information shown thereupon is identical to the sketch attached to RFI/0401/17292 Rev. 00 (refer to
Figure 2 above). SDS/0401/E/1141 Rev. 00 was later returned to us on 3 September 2019 whereby you /
the House of Expertise i.e. the Employer’s Fire Consultant (Profire), classified the accompanying Shop
Drawing as Status Code 3 ‘Revise & Resubmit’. This was accompanied by following comment:
“Rigid steel conduit is shown on Contractor’s approved Shop Drawing No. 401-AN-E-07-GE-0.00-SP-SD003 Rev. 00 for areas below 2400mm. Any changes to an agreed installation method will require
approval from ADAC.
See response to RFI 17292 of your proposed installation method.”
For the reasons explained above, there is no change or modifications to the installation method, nor
were we seeking ADAC’s agreement to change the conduits either. For the avoidance of doubt:
•
Shop Drawing No. 401-AN-E-E07-GE-0.00-SP-SD-050 Rev. 00 is specifically for ‘Typical Conduit
Installation for EC Rooms, MCR Rooms, SCR Rooms, TC Rooms (Surface Mounted)’ reflecting the
installation of EMT conduits to areas that would not be subject to severe physical damage below
2400mm from FFL (i.e. per Specification Section 260533 Clause 3.1.B.3); and
•
The detail shown on Shop Drawing No. 401-AN-E-07-GE-0.00-SP-SD-003 Rev. 00 [Detail 7] is a
‘Typical Conduit Installation (Surface Mounted)’ detail and reflects the installation detail of RSC to areas
that would be subject to severe physical damage below 2400mm from FFL (i.e. per Specification Section
260533 Clause 3.1.B.4).
Given the Code 3 response to the Rev. 00 Submittal and the response to RFI/0401/17292 Rev. 00, we
submitted Shop Drawing Submittal No. SDS/0401/E/1141 Rev. 01 on 13 October 2019, for approval of
Shop Drawing No. 401-AN-E-E07-GE-0.00-SP-SD-050 Rev. 01 ‘Typical Conduit Installation for EC Rooms,
MCR Rooms, SCR Rooms, TC Rooms (Surface Mounted)’ clarifying matters (Figure 4 below):

You subsequently returned SDS/0401/E/1141 Rev. 01 on 3 November 2019 whereby you / the House of
Expertise i.e. Profire, classified the accompanying Shop Drawing (Rev. 01) as Status Code 2. We note
however, your response exceeded the review time specified in the Contract (refer to Table 1):

We again remind you that Article 1.3 of Specification Section 013300 ‘Submittal Procedures’ governs the
processing time by which you are contractually obligated to respond to our Submittals. On the basis
that SDS/0401/E/1141 Rev. 01 is at Revision 01, then this ought to have been responded to by you
within 14 calendar days. However, you exceeded this review period by 7 calendar days.
Meanwhile however, on 30 October 2019, we received Non-Conformance Report (NCR) No. MTC-CMA0401-CM-NCR-01468, pertaining to what you allege were non-conformance issues concerning the
‘Exposed EMT Electrical Conduits installed below 2400 mm’ installed within the ‘Electrical closets (EC’s)
& Telecommunication closets (TC’s, SCR’s & MCR’s) – All MTB’ (refer to Figure 5 below). You have also
advised of the need to provide the various requirements listed at items 1 to 6 thereto.
Figure 5 – Extract from NCR No. MTC-CMA-0401-CM-NCR-01468
By the same token, the comments annotated on Shop Drawing No. 401-AN-E-E07-GE-0.00-SP-SD-050
Rev. 01 received on 13 October 2019, contained the following statements associated with (1) the NCR
reproduced in Figure 5 above; and (2) the requirement for a ‘risk assessment’ (refer to Figure 6):
Figure 5 – Extract from the response to SDS/0401/E/1141 Rev. 01
In summary therefore, for the reasons comprehensively addressed above, we conclude that:
1.
The ECRs, DCs, MCRs and SCRs etc. are not exposed to ‘severe’ physical damage;
2.
Your / the Employer’s Consultant’s response to RFI/0401/17292 Rev. 00 rejecting the conduits
installed up to and not exceeding the height of 2400mm from the finished floor level (FFL) are not only
unreasonable but totally unfounded; particularly in light of the fact that our Shop Drawing No. 401-ANE-E07-GE-0.00-SP-SD-050 Rev. 00 is for ‘Typical Conduit Installations for EC Rooms, MCR Rooms, SCR
Rooms, TC Rooms (Surface Mounted)’ reflecting the installation of EMT conduits to areas that would not
be subject to severe physical damage below 2400mm from FFL, thereby complying with Specification
Section 260533 Clause 3.1.B.3;
3.
Item 2 was further qualified and made clear by Shop Drawing No. 401-AN-E-E07-GE-0.00-SP-SD050 Rev. 01 issued under cover of RFI/0401/17292 Rev. 01, which was granted Status Code 2 on 13
October 2019. In doing so, this represents a de-facto acknowledgement that this Shop Drawing and the
contents shown thereupon were deemed satisfactory and ‘approved’;
4.
It therefore surprises us that following receipt of RFI/0401/17292 Rev. 01 on 13 October 2019,
you then issued NCR No. MTC-CMA-0401-CM-NCR-01468 which says that the exposed EMT conduits
installed below 2400mm in the electrical and telecommunication rooms [which we have established are
not exposed to ‘severe’ physical damage] are “not acceptable” and do not confirm to Shop Drawing No.
401-AN-E-07-GE-0.00-SP-SD-003 Rev. 00 [Detail 7] which as noted above reflects the installation of RSC

to areas that would be subject to severe physical damage below 2400mm from FFL, as per Specification
Section 260533 Clause 3.1.B.4;
5.
We further note your requirement for a risk assessment, but given that the EMT conduits and
the areas in which they are installed are not subject to severe physical damage, we question why there
is any need for a risk assessment (especially considering the difference between the two shop drawings
and the two types of conduit have been adequately explained)?
6.
In light of this we urge you to retract NCR No. MTC-CMA-0401-CM-NCR-01468 forthwith.
In view of the various circumstances summarised above, your comments are not only mistimed, but
unreasonable and without merit. You have also failed to take cognisance of the ramifications on the
project if you insist on instigating any changes – particularly at such a late stage of the Project.
Consequently, we record that your comments and additional requirements, if they are to be acted upon
should you insist, affect thousands of previously installed EMT conduits at numerous locations
throughout the Project, all of which would require replacing. This is notwithstanding the immense
amount of disruption that would be caused to completed works; all of which are wholly unnecessary.
Added to which, as indicated, your comments attempt to introduce changes to the existing IFC design
and Specifications which will require a valid Engineer’s Instruction (EI) and a Variation Order (VO).
SAA8 laid down mandatory procedures to be followed if additional works are required, and you have
failed to follow these; an EI and VO are needed for us to proceed with the aforementioned changes.
We therefore take this opportunity in reminding you of the provisions of Clauses 2.29 to 2.31 of
Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’) pertaining to Variations, in so far as we are not to
proceed with any Variation unless a Variation Order and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. In
which respect, it is your obligation to issue this Record first if you wish to instigate change; this is only
after the additional time and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.
Meanwhile, until such time as you take the action required of you in accordance with SAA8 Clause 2.29,
we are unable to proceed with implementing the changes noted above and will continue to proceed in
accordance with the existing IFC design to the extent we are able to. We trust this is clear.
Yours faithfully,
