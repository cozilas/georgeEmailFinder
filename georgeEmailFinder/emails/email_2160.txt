Dear Sir,
The Engineer's Assistant (EA) is in receipt of letter reference 1) above and finds the content totally
unacceptable. EA letter referenced 2) above states that the "EA confirms that the Contractor is required
to submit a quotation for the proposal in letter referenced M006-GDB-COM-LTR-04414".

It is not a precondition of any request for quotation that an acceptance of a proposal has to be provided.
To the contrary, it is the receipt of the quote that will allow the Engineer to make a decision under Vol.
3, Sub- Clause 13.2.3, on whether to proceed with the proposed change or not.

Therefore the Contractor's letters only serve to continue to delay the Engineer's ability make informed
decisions under Vol. 3, Sub-Clause 13.1 'Right to Vary'. The Contractor is directed to provide the
requested quotation under Vol. 3, Sub-Clause 13.2.1 without further delay.

Should ny abortive costs or delay to the Time for Completion arise, directly or indirectly as a result of the
Contract s failure to comply with Contractor's obligations under Volume 3, Clause 13 'Variations and
Adjustm nts', any such impacts will considered attributable to the Contractor's account.

Yours faithfully,
