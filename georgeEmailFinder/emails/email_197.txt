Re: Notice to Suspend the Subcontract Works Pursuant to Clause 23.1 of the Agreement
Dear Mr. Ali Haydar,
We write to you in accordance with the agreement dated 08 September 2016 (the "Agreement")
between TCA Joint Venture ("TCA") and MacDonald Humfrey Automation Middle East Control
Systems ("MHA"), for the provision of an Automated Tray Return System (the "Subcontract Works")
at the Midfield Terminal Building, Abu Dhabi International Airport.
Pursuant to clause 23.1 (Subcontractor's Entitlement to Suspend Work) of the Agreement and further
to our Notice of Intention to Suspend Work, issued to TCA and dated 22 December 2019, MHA
hereby notify TCA that the Subcontract Works will be suspended in full on Monday 3 February 2020.
As you already know, suspension is due to the delayed payment of the outstanding sum of AED15. 78
million, which is money due and owing by the TCA for that part of the Subcontract Works certified
complete. MHA may not resume the Subcontract Works until the outstanding sum of AED15.78
million is paid in full.
This letter is without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to MHA that have not been
expressly stated herein.
Copies of previous correspondences between MHA and TCA regarding the subject matter are
enclosed for your consideration.
Yours faithfully,
