Subject: Clause 27.1.5(a): Interim Particulars for the Basis of Claim
Dear Sir,
The Contractor refers to Notice of Claim No. 1011 (letter ref: 7), and hereby submits these detailed
interim
supporting particulars of the basis of claim in accordance with Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause
27.1.5(a).
1.0 Basis of Claim
Background
1.1 The Contractor provides a succinct overview of the events and circumstances leading to issuance
of Delay Notice No. 1011 i.e. Requests for Information RFI/0401/14116, RFI/0401/15239 and
RFI/0401/15493 in addition to Request for Engineer's Instruction RFEI/0401/0672, in Annex A
hereto.
1.2 Both RFI/0401/15239 and RFI/0401/15493 (refer Annex A), proposed additional works for the
Contractor at the interface of the Car Park Building and Car Park Bridge. These are contrary to the
IFC design and should have been undertake by the Car Park contractor (L& T) and consist of:
1.2.1 Additional rain screen scope;
1.2.2 Support and closure works in the Car Park structure;
1.2.3 Ensuring Other Contractor's works were weather tight; and

1.2.4 Altering ceiling heights to match the Car Park contractor's despite it differing from IFC
Drawings.
1.3 This prompted the facade package subcontractor (Jangho) to raise letter refs: 5 and 6, stating that
the RFis suggest additional scope of its subcontract and therefore require an Instruction issued
pursuant to CC-C 20.1.1(a) to proceed with the works.
Impacts otDelay
1.4 The ongoing failure to provide the required information described above, is preventing
completion of the following:
1.4.1 Shop Drawing submission;
1.4.2 Material fabrication; and
1.4.3 Installation works.
These Interim Particulars
1.5 However, Despite the issuance of Delay Notice No. 1011 (letter ref: 7, dated 20 February 2018), at
the date of the preparing these Interim Particulars (28 February 2018), the required design
remains outstanding, thereby preventing the works from progressing.
1.6 Consequently, the effects of the events and circumstances giving rise to this claim outlined above
remains on-going and therefore is continuing to have an effect on the Time for Completion.
1.7 As the effects of delay have, at the date of preparing these Interim Particulars, which is 28
February 2018, yet to be fully realised, then the events and circumstances outlined above giving
rise to this claim are deemed on-going and have a continuing effect on the Time for Completion of
the Works.
Summary
1.8 The Contractor undertakes to review the event(s) and circumstances described herein, in order to
assess the direct and consequential effects on the Time for Completion of the Works; the outcome
of which will be submitted in due course, pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.2.1.
2.0 Date Basis of Claim is Discovered
2.1 The Contractor considers that the date the basis of claim was discovered is 3 February 2018, when
the Contractor received Jangho's letter ref: 6; which represents the date when it became apparent
that the events and circumstances outlined above, was delaying the Contractor's Works and
would give rise to an entitlement to an extension to the Time for Completion, and associated
additional Costs.
3.0 Relevant Contract Provisions
3.1 The Contractor's entitlement to an extension to the Time for Completion of the various affected
Milestones, including inter alia MS09A1 (Pier 2), MS09A2 (Pier 3), MS09A3 (Pier 1), MS09A4 (Pier
4), and Milestones MS09B and MS10, and any associated additional I abortive Costs, arises from:
3.1.1 a breach of Contract or act of prevention on the part of the Employer, the Employer's
Personnel and I or the Consultants pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c); and
3.1.2 Contractor's Claims pursuant to Sub-Clause 27.1.
3.2 The impact that this delaying event will have on the Clause 16.3 Programme (Rev. 6.2) will be
determined by a Time Impact Analysis pursuant to Clause 27.2.1 of the Conditions of Contract. 3.3 In the
meantime, further interim and I or final details of this claim will be provided in accordance
with Sub-Clause 27.1.S(b) and Sub-Clause 27.1.5(c).

Yours faithfully,
