Dear Sir,

This is notice under Sub-Clause 2.5.1 that the Employer considers himself to be entitled to a payment in
connection with the Contract, as described below.

PARTICULARS OF ENTITLEMENT

1.
Contract Volume 3 Sub-Clause 4.26.1 requires the Contractor to provide Monthly Progress
Reports within seven days after the last day of the period to which it relates. Requirements addressing

4.26 and Volume 4, Clause 4.

The Contractor failed to comply with the above requirements, thus the Employer claims
entitlement to the value of additional hours spent by Engineer's Assistant's Personnel in order to
compile necessary information and obtain the updated status of the Project.
Dear Sir,

We have been advised that the number of beds being provided at both the proposed welfare locations
have been reduced as detailed below:

1.
Al Riffa originally planned for 2,328 beds with provision r an dditional 700 beds. This has now
been reduced to 1,584 beds. ..( )oo
2.

AlWakra originally planned for 1,500 beds. This has now been reduced to 1,257 beds.

.( Qo o

This causes great concern as the original plan catered for a total of 3,828 beds with provision of an
additional 700 beds, giving a total of 4,528 beds. Your planned total now is 2,841 beds. This is a deficit of
1,687 beds compared to your original plan.
Your present manning level is running in excess of 4,500 staff I workers, of whom approximately
3,800 are workers that are now reguired to live in temporary accommodation. J.:. .JJl QJ.J- "'- CC°'-.

At present you have Eight (8) Subcontractors that are non-compliant with the 2005 Housing Law,
therefore they are also non-compliant with Resolution 18 of 2014 .The Subcontractors and number of
workers as reported by the contractor is as follows:

1.

HSSG (93 workers)

2.

Bardawil {16 workers)

3.

5.

CCI and Subcons (112 workers)

6.

Brands (33 workers)

7.

8.

Sunrise (3 workers)

There are also five (5) Subcontractors whose accomodation has not yet been approved and only
J requires minor works to obtain approval. The majority of these remain outstanding, and are
t' required to obtain the Engineer's Assistant's approval. Furthermore, these Subcontractors
have
been audited in line with Resolution 17 and not Resolution 18, so they will be re-audited in
accordance with the revised Law. The following companies shall be audited:

1.

Al Masood (401 workers)

2.

we are accommodation.

The Engineer's Assistant advises that, as soon as ALYSJ JV accommodation at Al Riffa is operational the
Qatar Foundation Migrant Workers Welfare Standard (2013) will become mandatory as per ALYSJ JV
contractual obligations. ?
/·
It is noted that based on previous audits of the ALYSJ JV Subcontractors ,_none of them are in a
position to meet the contractual obligations of the Qatar Foundation Migrant Workers Welfare Standard
(2013).

The Engineer's Assistant has previously been advised that ALYSJ JV intends to upgrade the Barwa
welfare facility in the Industrial Area. The Engineer's Assistant cautions ALYSJ JV, that they should
consider that the previous audit conducted jo intly by the Engineer's Assistant and ALYSJ JV HSE
Manager rejected the Barwa facility, as it was not compliant with the Qatar Foundation Migrant
Workers Welfare Standard (2013), refer to letter Ref No M006-LBE-HMS-LTR- 00042 dated 01 Oct 2014 .

The Engineer's Assistant would not consider any type of upgrading of this facility without ALYSJ JV first
having the full agreement with Barwa jo wrjtja,g, and ALYSJ JV prepares and submits a detailed
feasibility studv, showing how this facility can be upgraded jo full compliance to Qatar Foundation
Migrant Workers Welfare Standard (2013).

ALYSJ JV shall submit a detailed plan describing how they will meet the aforementioned welfare
requirements on or before the 15 March 2015.

Yours faithfully,
