Subject:Notice of Delay – Obstructions to Steel Door Installation
Dear Sir,
The Contractor confirms receipt of the Subcontractor’s letter (1) which responds to the previous
notification sent by the Other Subcontractor J&H Emirates LLC (Jangho) in respect of the obstructions
allegedly caused by the Subcontractor to the steel door installation. Whilst the Contractor acknowledges
that some site communication would certainly be beneficial to resolving the issues notified by Jangho, it
is important to record that there is minimum manpower, and practically no supervisory staff, engaged
by the Subcontractor in completing its works in the external façade. This is not only having an impact on
Jangho’s ability to progress the doors, but also on the completion of louvers and windows.
In relation to the systematic response given by the Subcontractor: “Jangho to provide the correct
marking for IDC to cut edge”, the Contractor notes that it remains the Subcontractor’s sole responsibility
to complete the Subcontract Works in accordance with the relevant drawings. Any assistance that the
site representatives of Jangho might have given in the past does not waive such responsibility.
The Contractor also notes the Subcontractor’s citation of Clause 12.12 and reminds that the referred site
coordination is a two-way process which also requires the Subcontractor’s cooperation. The
Subcontractor is therefore required to communicate with the Contractor’s site representatives and
attend a coordination meeting with Jangho within seven days from this notice.

Yours faithfully,
