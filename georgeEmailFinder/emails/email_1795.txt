Dear Sir,

The Engineer's Assistant (EA) refers to letter reference 1) wherein the Contractor was directed to submit
a quotation for any cost and time impact and subsequently reminded by reference 2). Although the
Contractor failed to respond, Engineer's Instruction reference 3) was issued containing the same request
which was again delayed. The last reminder, reference 4), followed and was due by 21 August 2016.

EA must now conclude that the Contractor is unwilling to provide the requested quotation given that a
total period of 116 days has elapsed without response.

Absent compliance with the Engineer's direction to provide a quotation , the Engineer is now compelled
to complete the Variation without input from the Contractor .

Yours faithful!
Dear Sir,

This is a proposal under Sub-Clause 20.1.8 to amend the period within which the Engineer's Assistant is
required to respond to the Contractor's Claim No.065. The proposed period is 42 days ending on 24
October 2016 and will be automatically renewed by a further 42 days, on a rolling basis. Either Party can
terminate the rolling extension by issuing a 28 days' notice to the other Party.
Please c nfirm your approval by signing and returning this letter to the Engineer's Assistant.
Yours faithfully,
