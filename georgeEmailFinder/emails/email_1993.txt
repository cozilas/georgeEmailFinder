Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer’s Instruction of reference 6) issued pursuant to General Condition (“GC”) 13.1.1
of Volume 3 of the Contract, the Contractor encloses herewith full particulars in relation to the abortive
and / or additional design works pursuant to its GC 13.2.2 obligations.

This evaluation of abortive design costs does not rely upon the actual costs brought forward by M/s
Atkins and the Contractor’s respective determinations but on the same principle put forward by the
Engineer’s Assistant via letter reference 3) in quantifying the abortive design costs in relation to the
cross-passages

Provided that the instruction of letter reference 6) was received in parallel with those of letter
references 5) and 7), and, that the effect in both cases has been the occurrence of concurrent abortive
design in relation to the passageways, the Contractor concludes that the cost of abortive design arising
out of the instruction of letter reference 5) is deemed to be included within the valuation of letter
reference 2).

All necessary proof therefore comprising of the relevant outgoing design transmittals to the DVE prior to
the receipt of the Engineer’s Instruction of letter reference 6), i.e. a comprehensive ‘list of deliverables’
which form the basis of the Contractor’s entitlement, can be found in attachment 2) of letter reference
2).

On the basis of the Engineer’s Assistant pricing methodology therefore, the Contractor has thus far
evaluated several elements of abortive design costs, all of which have been summarized in table 1)
below. The relevant head of claims by Atkins have also been included for information only, so as to
enable a direct comparison of the amounts involved.
