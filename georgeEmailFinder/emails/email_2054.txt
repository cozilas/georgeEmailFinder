Dear sir
Further to the above referenced letters and the request from Qatar Rail MDto reduce the time of the
Temporary Traffic Management (TTM) with twelve months for both Joaan and Bin Mahmoud stations
we herewith inform you as follows .

TTM at Joaan Station:

ALYSJ has conducted an exercise to reduce the time of the TTM at Joaan station as much as possible.
The result of this exercise was presented during a meeting with Qatar Rail CEO at Joaan station on 5th
July 2015. A copy of the presentation is attached to this letter for your further reference.

The conclusion of the exercise and as presented during the above referred meeting is as follows:
•
Traffic diversion for Station construction can be reduced by 2 months by acceleration of the
station construction.
•
Traffic diversion for pedestrian crossing can be reduced by 6.5 months by the introduction of an
alternative construction method. This alternative construction method is based on a "decking" method.
•
Overall reduction time of the TTM at Joaan station by acceleration and revised methodologies is
8.5 months.

The Engineer's Assistant is requested to confirm that a reduction of 8.5 months as opposed to the
requested 12 months for the TTM at Joaan station is a reduction of a sufficient order of magnitude that
QR would wish to proceed. . A detailed cost proposal will then be prepared for submission. We note that
the above proposal has not been incorporated in our updated programme.

TTM at Bin Mahmoud Station:

The exercise to reduce the time of the TTM at Bin Mahmoud stations has not yet been completed. An
acceleration programme is being developed. Please note that the reduction of time of the TTM is being
complicated by the multilevel buildings on top of the station box on either side of the lbn Mahmoud
street which prevent any possibility of a temporary diversion. Refer to the attached 30 view of the
station box and the multilevel buildings.
Yours faithfully,
