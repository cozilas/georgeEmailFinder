Subject: Response to Mosartâ€™s letter reference: MMM/18/MTB/185, dated 16 December 2018
Dear Sir,
We would like to acknowledge your recent letter dated 16 December 2018 and can confirm that we look
forward to receiving a revised comprehensive disruption claim, which will be in accordance with
recognised industry standards and practices. Further, contrary to your opinion against our initial
observations of your disruption claim (set out in our letter reference MTB/TCA/Mosart/L/000623, dated
16 October 2018), our intention was not to simply impose greater requirements and unnecessary
obstacles upon Mosart, but conversely, to point you in right direction of what is required to
demonstrate your potential entitlement to claim related disruption costs.
If you have any further queries regarding this matter please do not hesitate to contact us.
Yours faithfully,
