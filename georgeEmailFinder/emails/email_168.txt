Subject Notice to Correct- Shortage of Manpower (Bond & Chadwick)
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence (1) wherein the Engineer issued a Notice to Correct
pursuant to Clause 12.9.6 of the Conditions of Contract regarding the shortage in manpower with
respect to ANEL, PCEJV (NAFFCO), Jangho and Mosart.
We record that to date the Contractor has failed to effectively manage the above Subcontractors and
implement appropriate measures to ensure that the required manpower is in place. Furthermore,
another Subcontractor (Bond) has demobilized their resources from site on 18 January 2020 and to
date there has been no progress in relation to the SCN works. Bond's absence from site has affected
not only the physical works but also the As-Builts submission {1271 As-Built Drawings pending to be
submitted). We also note that for the past 3 weeks there have been no WIRs submitted for the
inspection of the completed installations.
In addition to the above, Chadwick is also lacking in resources and although we note that the
Contractor has supported their Subcontractor with their own resources for the physical works, the
Engineer raises concern as to the Contractor's plan to ensure there are no delays or issues with the
provision of Close-out Documentation, Test Certification, As-Builts and Warranties should Chadwick
completely demobilise from the Project.
In light of the above, the Notice pursuant to Clause 12.9.6 of the Conditions of Contract remains and
we request that the Contractor implements immediate measures to rectify this issue and ensure that
their Subcontractors retain the required levels of resources at all time on site.
Yours faithfully,
