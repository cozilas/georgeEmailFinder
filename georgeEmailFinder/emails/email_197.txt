Subject: Engineer's Determination: Clause 11.4 and 27.1.8 of the Conditions of Cont ract
Dear Sir,
We refer to your letter ref: 6 issued in reply to our letter ref: 5, following receipt of your let ter ref: 4. In
letter ref: 4 you inform us "[tjhe Engineer maintains its position for disapproval of the Contractor's TIA
No. 1 â€“ Post SAAB for the reasons set in [the Engineer's letter ref: 4]" and in which you refute that you
have not provided detailed comments on the principles of our claim pursuant to Clause 27 .1.6.
We disagree and for ~he reasons comprehensively set out in our letter ref: 5, maintain that yo u have f
ailed to provide "detailed comments" in support of your disapproval as required by the Contract, despite
us having issued a comprehensive response to your assessment of our claim vide letter ref: 3.
Notwithstanding, we note you state that you have undertaken a '1urther forensic analysis" of our TIA
No. 1- Post SAA8, utilising our "disapproved delay analysis methodology", yet you still conclude that t
here is no entitlement extensions to the Time for Completion. Needless to say we are surprised by your
findings: we operated this methodology in reaching the entitlement that we have claimed.
We therefore request that you provide a copy of your detailed delay analysis with us soonest fbr our
review and understanding.
Yours faithfully,
