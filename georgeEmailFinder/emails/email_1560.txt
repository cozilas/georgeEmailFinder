Dear Sirs,

Further to the Contractor's December 2015 Claim Nr 034 monthly update issued under cover of
reference 3, the Contractor confirms, in accordance with General Condition ("GC") 20.1.6(b) of Volume 3
of the Contract, that the following updated additional costs in relation to Claim Nr 034 have been
incurred by the Contractor over the past month. Accordingly, the Contractor provides this January 2016
monthly update to Claim Nr 034.

The Contractor confirms that no additional cost information from others in relation to Claim 034 has
been received over the past month.

However, the Contractor's financing costs and overheads and profit "(OHP") upon same, has increased
since the Claim's initial interim submission on 26 November 2015 as no payment has been made to the
Contractor.

Claim 034's Financial January 2016 update is therefore as follows:

Finance costs have now been incurred over a period of 3 months since the commencement of the
Claim/Delay Event. Therefore, the totalfinance costs to date are:

(QAR 22,309,325.00 (design costs) + QAR 5,314,214.00 (construction value) + QAR 13,131,637.00
(prolongation costs) + QAR 5,298,173.00 (OHP @ 13% of the sum of all the preceding figures)) x 3/12
months x 4.25% pa (finance rate) = QAR 489,317.00.

OHP upon this finance cost are: OAR 489,317.00 x 13% (OHP rate) = QAR 63,611.00. Therefore, total
finance costs and OHP upon same to date are calculated as follows:
QAR 489,317.00 (finance costs to 31 January 2016) + QAR 63,611.00 (OHP upon finance costs) = OAR
552,928.00.

This provides a January 2016 updated Financial Summary for Claim 034 as follows:

further particulars, the Contractor shall be submitting further interim Claim submissions with respect to
the Claim Event giving rise to Claim Nr 034 at monthly intervals as required by GC 20 .1.6(b).
