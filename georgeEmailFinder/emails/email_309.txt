Subject:Post SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0161
Delays due to the Replacement of Damaged Cat 6 Cables at Central Processor L2.0 Sector 5.22D and
5.27A caused by Employer’s Fit-Out Contractor (DEPA)
- Request for Engineer’s Instruction / Variation Order
Dear Sirs,
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
Annex A records delays attributable to damages caused by the Employer’s Other Contractor (DEPA) to
previously installed IT/ SCS Cables at CP L2.0 Sector 5.22D & 5.27A, which require rectification and as
such requires an Engineer’s Instruction (EI) and Variation Order (VO) in order for us to do so.
Potential Impact
Disruptions and delays caused by others such as that outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
increasingly likely to impact on achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within seven (7) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
On 24 July 2019 we received letter reference BND/MTB/HO/2019/1970 [also dated 24 July 2019] from
the specialist Information Technology subcontractor (M/s BOND) notifying us of “delay” to their IT / SCS
installations due to damage caused by the Employer’s Fit-Out Contractor (M/s DEPA) to previously
installed and terminated 2 nos. Cat 6 Cables at CP Level L2.0 Sectors 5.22D and 5.27A.
Despite the cables having been installed, inspected and handed over vide the WIR process, BOND
informs us that the damage occurred while DEPA were ‘chipping’ the completed screed located in the
above noted areas, and moreover, DEPA’s works are still ongoing, therefore, as BOND states, there is
every likelihood that further damage will be found. A copy of BOND’s letter (‘Notice of Delay’) is
attached for reference; the photos attached thereto clearly evidencing the damaged cables.
Meanwhile, BOND further advise that the approximate length of the damaged Cat 6 Cables is 150 m,
and requires total replacement, along with related termination, labelling, testing and commissioning and

inspection; this is notwithstanding the difficulties and access requirements faced by BOND in performing
such works at this [late] stage of the project close out of IT / SCS works.
In view of the above and the content of the attached letter, it is evidently clear that the events and
circumstances cited herein are not of our doing or responsibility, and any rectification / remedial works
necessarily required to re-install and re-test the damaged cables will invariably delay us.
We therefore inform you in order for us to undertake the rectification works to the damaged cables
noted above, will require the issuance of a Variation Order (VO) / Engineer’s Instruction (EI). SAA8 laid
down strict guidelines to follow in the event that additional works are required and we therefore
request you to issue the necessary VO / EI for the requisite rectification works to be undertaken.
Furthermore, we request you to take necessary action to prevent any further occurrence of damages to
our previously handed-over MEP services installation by the Employer’s Other Contractors.
Yours faithfully,
