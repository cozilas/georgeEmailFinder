Subject:Wire Joints in FDB Panels
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to your letter (1) in which you advise us of the discovery of wire joints inside an
energized FDB panel at Pier 3, during an inspection.
We take such an occurrence seriously and have held countless meetings with our Subcontractor (Anel)
on the matter of wire joints and confirm that Anel site management has carried out a thorough internal
investigation into why this deviation of workmanship took place.
Anel has acknowledged the unacceptable practice and workmanship and the poor decision making
taken by members of their installation team.
Consequently, we assure you that Anel’s manpower is being managed closely by our site supervision and
QA/QC team, to ensure that there is no repetition.
This occurrence came about as a result of the requirement for repositioning [relocating] of Residual
Current Circuit Breaker with Overcurrent Protection (RCBO) to meet the load balancing of the overall
circuit. This re-work was instructed by you through Briefing Pack 20. Therefore, we do not concur with
you that the RCBO internal wire jointing issues at this location and at other locations, is a major
contributor to the Project’s delays.
Subsequently, an inspection was carried out with you at the location where RCBOs with the noncompliant jointed wires have been replaced and the related NCR has been closed.
Meanwhile, we continue to conduct daily onsite meetings with your team members as well as
submitting weekly progress reports to you which detail the positive progress made week on week
against the subject activities.
We conclude by reiterating that we remain fully committed to ADAC, the Project and to completing our
obligations within the shortest possible time, without compromising on safety and quality, but will not
be held responsible for such factors as those outlined above for which we are not culpable.
Yours faithfully,
