Subject: Target Programme to Completion Rev 10.2
Dear Sir,
Please find enclosed both an Excel and PDF version of Programme Rev 10.2 with a data date of 1'1
August 2017. The Rev 10.2 Programme represents the collaborative effort between the Employer,
Engineer, Contractor and Subcontractors to achieve substantial completion of the Works by 30 June
2019. This Programme considers all constraints that you have identified, including all Variations
instructed, as of 31 July 2017.
At present, Programme Rev 10.2 is not an approved Programme as understood either under the terms
of the Contract between the Employer and the Contractor or the terms of the Subcontract between the
Contractor and the Subcontractor. However, the Engineer intends to use Programme Rev 10.2 for
monitoring and control purposes with respect to the Contractor and Subcontractors until it is approved
or superseded by a revised approved Programme. Accordingly, we would request you to provide us
with, for monitoring and control purposes, your target programme to completion which aligns with
Programme Rev 10.2. We would request you to provide this to us by 31 October 2017.
Please note that this letter is not, of itself, to be considered as: (i) an admission of any entitlement to an
extension of time and/or entitlement to additional payment; or (ii) requiring the Subcontractor to
comply with an accelerated schedule; or (iii) constituting a waiver of any of the terms of the
Subcontract.
We look forward to your cooperation with this matter and timely receipt of your submission. Should you
have any queries please do not hesitate, in the first instance, to contact our Senior Planning Manager.
Yours faithfully
