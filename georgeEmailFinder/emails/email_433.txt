Subject:Clause 27.1.1: Notice of Claim – Delay Notice No. 0034 [Post SAA8]
Delay in Testing and Commissioning of Stand Pipe at Pier 1 due to Non-Availability of
Drainage Facility and Rejection of NOC - Update
Dear Sir
This letter serves as an update to E-Notice No. 0034 issued by way of our e-mail ref: (1).
Background
On 20 November 2018 we e-mailed you [at 1:40 pm] requesting confirmation of the availability of fire
water from Central Utility Plant (CUP) 02 to the Main Terminal Building (MTB) Fire Pumps at LB.1, as we
planned to invite the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) / House of Expertise (HOE) to witness the Cause
and Effect Testing (C&E) for the fire-fighting wet suppression system, ‘prior to Civil Defense’.
However, it was also our intention to simultaneously undertake the C&E testing at Pier 4 [on the basis
the fire water flows into the LB.1 Pump Room and then distributes to the rest of Pier 4] but as noted in
our subsequent e-mail also dated 20 November 2018 [2:45 pm] it had been ‘the water pressure is …
down as of today’. Hence we sought confirmation from you as to the availability of fire water for us to
use as the Employer had permitted the C&E testing to be carried out using water supplied by CUP-02 as
the water pressure could be maintained without the MTB Fire Pumps being in operation.
At this juncture it was clearly evident that any reduction in water pressure would invariably impact on
our ability to successfully undertake the C&E testing and the witnessing of such tests by the AHJ/HOE.
It was for this reason that in your reply e-mail dated 21 November 2018 [at 9:15 am] you suggested a
meeting to discuss a number of matters associated with the fire water supply from CUP-02. Amongst
other things, you advised us that the availability of fire water from CUP-02 shall be confirmed upon
receipt of the following information from us (1) date water is required; (2) duration water is required
and (3), our proposed discharge plan from the LB.1 pump room (where you cited the need of an NOC
and an Agreement with the Pond Dewatering Contractor), as well as for the Main Terminal Airport
Contractor “L&T [to] sort out the recent water leakage issues (TBC)”. The latter being undoubtedly the
cause of the reduction in water pressure from CUP-02 to Pier 4 cited in the 5th paragraph above.
Copies of e-mails exchanged on 20 and 21 November 2018 are referenced at (2).
Meanwhile, we had previously issued a request to obtain fire water from CUP-01 to be utilized for the
fire network and for the LB.2 fire pump commissioning, by way of NOC No. N-321 dated 26 September
2018. The requirement to obtain fire water from CUP-01 was necessarily required to enable us support
and continue the AHJ/HOE C&E inspections at Pier 4 as it had become evident that we were prevented
from obtaining fire water from CUP-02. In the event however, NOC No. N-321 was not responded to
and approved until 60 calendar days later on 25 November 2018 (ref: 3).

We maintain there are two reasons why the approval of NOC-321 was delayed.
1)
ADAC did not want to approve the NOC-321 until an agreement with the Pond Dewatering
Contractor was confirmed and in place relating to the Commissioning of the LB-2 Fire Pumps. This is also
reflected in your e-mail dated 21 November 2018 [at 9:15 am] cited above.
2)
However, when the CUP-02 water supply ceased, we had a meeting with ADAC on the 22
November 2018 following the mail dated the 21 November 2018 as mentioned above. ADAC thus
agreed and approved the NOC-321 on 25 November 2018 to use Fire Water from CUP-01. The approval
of the NOC-321 aided the ongoing C&E inspections with the AHJ/HOE at Pier-4. Also ADAC made a
statement in the meeting that the Fire Water from CUP-01 shall not be used for LB-2 Fire Pump
Commissioning until the Pond Dewatering Contractor was confirmed and in place (i.e. when we got the
pump dewatering contractor on board then ADAC allowed the Fire Water from CUP-01 to be used for
the LB-2 Fire Pump Commissioning).
Nevertheless, on 3 January 2019 (letter dated 30 December 2018 ref: MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/013908) (ref:
4), we submitted NOC No. N-348, requesting approval for us to discharge the fire water on top of the
PQC slabs and into the L&T grated drain at Pier 1 Gatehouses for Fire-Fighting standpipe testing. This
indicated an approximate duration [as requested by you to do so] of one month for the noted works].
Unfortunately however, NOC No. N-348 was returned rejected on 14 January 2019 due to the on-going
subsidence treatment for the grated channel between Gatehouses GH49 and GH02 – your letter ref:
MTC-CMA-TCA-0401-LTR-10327 dated 14 January 2019 refers (ref: 5).
On 11 February 2019 (letter dated 7 February 2019, ref: MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/014009) (ref: 6), we
responded and issued NOC No. N-371 also dated 7 February 2019, representing a renewal request to
discharge the fire water on top of the PQC slabs and into the L&T grated drain at Pier 4 Gatehouses for
the fire-fighting standpipe testing during AHJ and Civil Defence Inspections. In this, we indicated a
commencement date [21 February 2019] and a handover date [10 March 2019]; as requested to do so.
Unfortunately however, this was also rejected, evident from the L&T marked up copy of NOC No. N-371
attached to your Transmittal Advice No. MTC-CMA-TCA-0401-TML-06179 dated 24 February 2019 (ref:
7); with L&T commenting that it was currently undertaking line marking works at all stands at or around
Pier 3 and Pier 4 and that ‘water cannot be discharged on the pavement currently’. Note: it was a
requirement to discharge the fire water on top of the PQC slabs and into the L&T grated drain at Pier 4
for the Civil Defence inspection (i.e. to demonstrate the standpipe performance at Pier 4 to Civil
Defence). ADAC then officially sent us an email on 27 February 2019 [4:50pm] stating that we could
proceed with stand-pipe testing to Pier 4 the following day, i.e. 28 February 2019.
Shortly thereafter, on 2 March 2019 (letter dated 27 February ref: MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/014062) (ref: 8),
we issued you with a further NOC, No. N-376 (dated 27 February 2019), reiterating our request to
discharge the ‘fire’ water on top of the PQC slabs and into L&T grated drain to complete the T&C of Fire
Fighting Stand Pipe at Pier 1 Gatehouses for fire-fighting standpipe testing; and reflected a duration of 2
weeks, commencing on 10 March 2019 with the handover planned for 24 March 2018.
On 6 March 2019, we received Transmittal Advice No. MTC-CMA-TCA-0401-TML-06198 also dated 6
March 2019 (ref: 9), attached to which was the ‘approved’ NOC No. N-376; albeit not only had the
handover date had been changed to 19 March 2019 but we note that approval was conditional upon our
agreement to a series of qualifications and conditions. These included us ensuring that: the discharged
water was to be undertaken as per the marked up plan attached thereto; no ingress of water to the
treatment area was permitted; and to ensure that a ‘protection scheme’ was in place.
We therefore contend that the foregoing delay to the testing and commissioning of the Stand Pipe at
Pier 1 due to a combination of the lack of an available water supply and various actions of the MTA
contractor, constitutes an act of prevention on the part of the Employer, the Employer’s Personnel and
the Employer’s Other Contractor on the Site. This affected our ability to carry out and complete the firefighting standpipe testing at end of November 2018 / early December 2018 as planned, which in view of

the importance of the cause and effect integration, has the potential to impact upon our ability to
achieve completion of inter alia Milestones MS09B and MS09C (Substantial Completion).
Therefore in accordance with Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1, we hereby notify
you of our entitlement to claim:
(i)
An extension of the Time for Completion of the Works pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c); and
(ii)
An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.2 pursuant to Clause 12.12,
or, in the alternative, damages for breach of Contract.
Interim and / or final details of the Time impacts and adjustment to the Contract Price will be provided
in due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.5(a), (b) and (c).
Yours faithfully,
