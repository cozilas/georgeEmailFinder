Dear Sir,
Engineer's Assistant refers to letter 1) referenced above, wherein the Contractor was requested to
submit a quotation under Sub-Clauses 13.2.1 & 13.2.2 Despite reminder letters 2) and 3) referenced
above. the Contractor's continued delay in providing the quotation has prevented the Engineer from
progressing by making an informed decision under the Sub-Clause 13.2.3.

The Contractor is reminded that any abortive costs or delay to the Time for Completion arising, directly
or indirectly as a result of the Contractor's failure to comply with obligations under Volume 3, Clause 13
'Variations and Adjustments', will be considered solely attributable to the Contractor's account.

Contracto is directed to provide the quotation without any further delay.

Yours faithfully,
