Subject Benchmark Completion - Finishes

Dear Sir,
We write again to raise our concerns regarding the Contractor's delays in completing and delivering the
required finishes mock-up/in-place mock-ups as specified in the Contract Specifications and A12 IFC
Drawings. We reiterate that all works without approved Benchmarks are at your own risk.
Despite a series of site walks, meetings and pre-inspections to assist the Contractor, there are various
reasons delaying the target dates and these have been discussed in our previous letters referenced (1
and 2).
As of 6 September 2018, there are 183 nos. accepted and signed benchmark tags out of 260 and there
are significant outstanding works which remain to be completed. The Contractor must provide its action
plan including target completion dates for these remaining works which will also include the mitigation
measures to be implemented for the recovery of the delays caused.
In addition, we are aware that the Mock-up I Benchmark Manager (Liam McElhinney) is no longer
working on the Project. The Contractor is required to immediately inform us of his replacement in order
to avoid any further adverse effect to the delivery of the required mock-up.
We await for your action.
Yours faithfully,
