Subject:Re: Liquid Spillage CP L3.0 North/South Transfer areas
Dear Sir,
We are in receipt of your letter referenced (3) above, in which you have reported water/liquid spillages
on the installed stones and asserted that “…it has been observed that the stone has been damaged due
to the prolonged saturation of the liquid on the surface and/or nature/entity of the liquid”. After
reviewing the videos which were included in your mentioned letter and as per our records, we note that
the installed stones are exposed and have remained unprotected for a long period of time.
We therefore, reiterate our position as stated in our letters referenced (1 & 2) above, and further state
that pursuant to the Conditions of the Subcontract Agreement Clause 24.2 [Subcontractor's Care of the
Subcontract Works], you have an obligation to take full responsibility for the care of your works until the
issuance of the Taking Over Certificate, in which you have failed to do so. Consequently, your assertions
in your letter referenced (3) are not accepted and your letter is totally disregarded.
In view of the above, we reiterate our concerns regarding your inadequate protection of the Works. At
this juncture, you are instructed to immediately take necessary precautions to protect the Works and
comply with Schedule 0 [Scope of Subcontract Works] of the Subcontract Agreement, Sub-Clause
4.2.19A [General Services & Builders Works] which states that "The Sub-Contractor acknowledges the
obligation to take full responsibility to protect its work…”.
This is for your information and immediate action.
Yours faithfully,
