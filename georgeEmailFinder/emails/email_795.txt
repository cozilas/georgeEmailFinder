Subject:

2nd BIM Cost Proposal â€“ No Confirmation of Variation Order

Dear Sir,
We write in continuation to our letter referenced in (6) above, wherein we have confirmed our
acceptance of your quotation as per the subject matter and we inform you the following.
Please be informed that since we have not confirmed or issued you with the Variation Order as
mentioned in our said letter, we hereby inform you that we have decided to do the BIM scope of works
internally. Consequently, kindly be informed you that our letter referenced (6) is disregarded and you
are therefore instructed not to proceed with such scope of works. This is to mitigate some of the delays
in the execution of your works and ensure your timeous coordination with other trades.
This is for your information and record.
Yours faithfully,
