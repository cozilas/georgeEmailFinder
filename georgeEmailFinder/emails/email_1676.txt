Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer’s Instruction Nr.89 of reference 1) issued pursuant to General Condition (“GC”)
13.1.1 of Volume 3 of the Contract, the Contractor encloses herewith full particulars of its actual design
costs related to the optimization of the Passageways’ Width.

The relevant Fee Change Notice (FCN) 071 includes payment requests from Atkins on account of other
design changes as well which are not related to the Engineer’s Instruction Nr. 89 and hence no reference
has been made herein. Those shall be addressed by the Contractor under a separate cover in due
course.

As a direct consequence of this instruction to vary the works, the Contractor instructed Atkins to
perform additional work and has received a notice for additional payment by Atkins on account of the
additional design works entailed. Those can be summarized as per the following table:

Table 1) FCN 071 (Subway Width Reduction): Amounts claimed by Atkins, ALYSJ JV Determination for the
same and payments to date

As detailed herein, the Contractor estimates that QAR 8,510,410.87 is a fair and reasonable
compensation to Atkins against the originally claimed value of QAR 13,860,192.96 which was, at the
Contractor’s opinion, overstated both in terms of the applicable staff rates and the respective time
spent.

The Contractor has enclosed as attachment 1) to this letter its determination of FCN 071.

Whilst noting that none of its aforementioned determination amounts have been agreed with Atkins as
full and sole compensation with the entire balance being the subject of an ongoing dispute, the
Contractor has nevertheless paid the amount of QAR 7,702,680.74 already, for which proof of payment
in the form of electronic payment (wire transfer) documents has been enclosed as attachment 2).

It is finally noted that the remaining MEP design works in relation to the said FCN have been de-scoped
from Atkins and currently being undertaken by Worley Parsons and as such, the Contractor reserves its
rights to bring forward evidence of its future payments for the same.

In any event, and whilst noting that the FCN 071 determination amount may be subject to further
change, the Contractor kindly requests the Employer to proceed with an interim, on-account payment of
its current determination value plus 12% for profits and overheads, in the net amount of QAR
8,627,002.43.

Such payment would be of invaluable assistance to the continued financing of the Project.

Yours faithfully,
