Dear Sir,

Further to your feasibility study concerning the Central Cooling System for the Gold Line, we are now
reviewing the implementation of the new concept of stations and tunnel cooling.

According to your feasibility study, this new concept results in lower number of chiller yards to be
constructed above the stations. The concept will be based on two central cooling plants located in
Airport City North (feeding the stabling yard, Al Sharq National Museum and Doha Souq stations) and Al
Sadd Stadium (feeding for one side Al Adhawaa, Al Sadd C-Ring and Al Sadd stations and for the other
side Al Waab City, Sports City and Villaggio stations) .

We need your estimate of the cost impact on the project with in particular the cost saving due to the
lower number of chiller yards above stations, the cost of the central cooling plants and cost of the pipes
network to be implanted in the tunnel.

Please resubmit your cost details by 30 June, 2014.
Yours faithfully,
