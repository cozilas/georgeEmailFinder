Re-Grouting Works to Pier 4 (GH 38) and Cracking to LB.1 Raft Slab
Dear Sir
We refer to the cracking that appeared during week commencing 13 March 2020 to the Level LB.1 Raft
Slab and following the joint meeting held on 23 March 2020 (ref: 1) would like to confirm that we have
so far undertaken the following measures and/or preliminary site investigations:
1.
The additional re-grouting works to Pier 4 (adjacent GH38) were stopped immediately on 18
March 20 as soon as the cracks had been found to have occurred to the Basement Level LB.1 slab (SSL
+3.0) by building division. A time frame of the additional re-grout works together with the drilling fluid
loss consumption for each point is attached at Annex A for reference.
2.
4 piezometers have been installed within the additional re-grouting zone (1 outside the D-wall
and 3 inside) in order to start monitoring the water table level. Locations of the Piezometers and reading
for last few days are attached hereto (refer to Annex B).
3.
Installation of additional 5 piezometers are ongoing (additional 3 piezometers on airside away
from the additional re-grouting zone and 2 Piezometers at the landside zone). Annex C refers.
4.
Inquiries / site visits were undertaken on 21 and 22 March 2020 with a dewatering company
(Transmak), with a view to installing a suitable dewatering system to try and lower the water level in the
immediate vicinity in order to reduce the pressure to the basement slab to avoid continuity of cracking
(refer to attached e-mail at Annex D). We awaiting their feedback.
5.
Discussions with BAUER and their geotechnical consultant (Orbit) remain ongoing associated
with undertaken a geophysical survey at the Basement Level LB.1 slab area (at the location of the
observed cracking), in order to identify what exactly is beneath the Level LB.1 raft slab.
6.
Discussions for potential coring through the raft slab are also on-going (the coring will provide
relief holes with packers to extract the water). This option may be implemented immediately after the
geophysical survey while waiting the dewatering company’s technical suggestions.
In light of the potential seriousness of this issue, we urge you to insist that the MTB Designer, i.e. the
Employer’s Design Consultant (ARUP) take an active part in respect of the above as a matter of urgency
and lead the ongoing investigation and provide direction for further investigation and/or the required
rectification/reinstatement works. Meanwhile, please consider this letter as an advance notification,
pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), that the
events and/or circumstances described above are likely to cause delay and disruption to the Works.
Yours faithfully,
