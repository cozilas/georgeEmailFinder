Subject:RE: Notice to Correct – Estidama Non-Compliance
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to above subject following our previous correspondence (2) and your
subsequent reply (3) whereby you stated you had compiled all outstanding reports until June. The
Estidama Team has since reviewed the report and deemed it to be non-compliant – therefore the
outstanding NCR remains valid.
As highlighted previously, Estidama compliance for the whole MTB project is at risk as a result of your
failure to submit the necessary data for the mandatory report. Therefore, you are instructed pursuant to
Clause 11.3 [Instructions of the Contractor] to submit your monthly report for October 2018 with
immediate effect – inclusive of all materials delivered to the site to date. Accordingly, you are hereby
instructed to correct the above to the satisfaction of the Contractor within seven (7) days from receipt
of this letter.
This notice is issued to you pursuant to Clause 22.1 [Notice to Correct]. In addition, it should be noted in
accordance with Subcontract Clause 21.1.2 [Payment Terms] we reserve the right to implement
withholding measures concerning forthcoming payment certificates should you fail to take appropriate
action to rectify the aforementioned.
This is for your immediate action and attention.
Yours faithfully,
