Subject: Closing out Engineer's Instructions (EI's)
Dear Sir,
In line with the Variation Procedure being followed and to expedite issuing Variation Orders, the
Employer is requesting to close out the Engineer's Instructions (EI's) at the outset.
Thus you are requested to review enclosed Engineers Instruction List and confirm, by latest 18 JANUARY
2018, that there are no outstanding Request For Variation Order (RFVO) submissions left for these El's.
Should you have anything pending related to these El's, you are requested to submit your RFVO
submissions immediately and in any case no later than 18 JANUARY 2018.
Kindly note that in case we do not receive any response by 18 JANUARY 2018, we would consider that
there is nothing outstanding for these El's and shall advise the same to the Employer and any submission
related to these El's beyond above mentioned date may prejudice your entitlement.
Yours faithfully,
