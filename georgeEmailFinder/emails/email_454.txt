Subject: Submission of presentation for the chairman’s meeting
Dear Sir

We write with reference to the presentation preaped by the contractor for the weekly chairman’s
meeting.
Please be notified that the contractor is required to submit the presentation 24 hours prior to the
scheduled meeting in order to enable the employer and the engineer to review and provide comments.
The employer has repeatedly requested the above, howeber to date the contractor has not complied. It
is unacceptable that his week’s presentation was issued at 8.33am i.e. half an hour prior to the meeting.
We trust the above request will be adhered by the contractor and henceforward the presentation will
be provided in a timely manner.
Yours faithfully,
