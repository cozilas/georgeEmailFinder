Subject Continuing Delays by the Contractor and Funding of the Works
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence (1) and respond as follows.
Please note that TCAJV should have directed this letter to the Engineer, as required by the Contract.
Please direct all further correspondence to the Engineer.
The Contractor has failed to achieve Milestones MS06A, MS06B, MS09B, and MS09C, in consequence
of which, delay damages have accrued in a total amount of AED 1,220,146,000 as at 9 December
2019. Accordingly, at this point in time, TCAJV are required by the Employer to deliver the following
three critical items:
1. A definitive and comprehensive programme and plan for completion of the Works, for
approval by the Engineer for monitoring purposes as a target programme;
2. Details of the agreement that TCAJV has reached with its banks to resolve the funding of the
completion of the Works; and
3. Confirmation from all the key Subcontractors that they will resource the job adequately to
support the programme provided for monitoring purposes as a target programme, referred to
in paragraph 1 above.
We remind you that it is TCAJV's responsibility as the Contractor to ensure that the completion of the
Works is adequately funded . That is not a matter for ADAC as the Employer, accordingly, it is not
appropriate for ADAC to meet TCAJV's banks to discuss TCAJV's funding arrangements.
The Engineer looks forward to receiving TCAJV's plan for completion, including the three critical
Employer requested items set out above. Until that time, there is no need for the Employer to meet
with the Contractor to discuss.
Please note that we are writing this letter under reservation of all of ADAC's rights arising un r the
Contract .
Yours faithfully
