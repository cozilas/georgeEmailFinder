Dear Sir,

The Contractor acknowledges receipt of the Engineer's Instruction pursuant to Sub-Clause 13.1.1 under
letter reference 1) instructing the design and construction of a third pedestrian entrance at grade
including related MEP, Architectural Finishes and Utility diversions at Qatar National Museum Station.

The Contractor notes that the Engineer's instruction refers to Option 3a, which is an optimized solution
compared to the option for which the Contractor submitted a quotation under letter reference 2).

Further to the Engineer's Assistant's request, the Contractor encloses herewith its revised financial
proposal for the optimized Option 3a.

The estimated structural, civil, MEP, architectural finishes and utility relocation design and construction
cost is provided for budgeting purposes only, and it does not include any other additional cost that may
arise as a consequence of the Engineer's Instruction, such as the cost of rework or abortive design,
especially for the Qatar National Museum station concourse level. These costs (if any) will be addressed
under separate cover.

For the avoidance of doubt, this submissions supersedes the financial proposal submitted under
reference 2).

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.
Yours faithfully,
