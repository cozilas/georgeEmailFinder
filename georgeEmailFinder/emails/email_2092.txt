Dear Sir,
The Engineer's Assistant refers to the above listing of correspondence and specifically item 1) where the
Contractor was instructed under Sub-Clause 13.1.1 of the Conditions of Contract, to submit a detailed
assessment of the adjustment to the Contract Price based on the savings associated with a reduced
number of Cross Passageways.

Subsequent follow up letters referenced in items 2) and 4) further emphasized Contractor's failure to
recognize the Employer's Instruction for submission of a price adjustment due to the reduction in Cross
Passageway requirements.
As a consequence the Engineer's Assistant requires the Contractor to respond with an appropriate price
saving adjustment, fully detailed and submitted by no later than Monday 27 July 2015.
If Contractor fails to respond by the above submittal date, the Engineer will have no option but to
consider the Employer's rights under the Contract to invoke sub-clause 3.5 and consider a fair
determination taking due regard of all relevant circumstances
Yours faithfully,
