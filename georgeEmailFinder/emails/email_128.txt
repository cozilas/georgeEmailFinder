Re: Cloisall Disruption Claim -Wall Cladding

Dear Sir,
We refer to your letter reference CLO/0401/MTB-CEILING/CONT/11576/18 dated 18 February 2018
[received on 18 March 2018] regarding your Wall Cladding Disruption Claim and note that whilst you
refute our rejection of the claim, you have failed to address the deficiencies that we identified and
communicated to you via our letters referenced MTB/TCA/CLOISALL/L/001220 and 001266 dated 5th
February 2018 and 10th March 2018 respectively.
In this regard we again note:
(i)
The ‘measured mile’ analysis is not supported by sufficiently detailed and objectively verifiable
contemporary records. Moreover, if as you assert, the classification between Ceiling, Junction and Wall
Cladding is of no relevance (insofar as materials and/or installation criteria does not change) then why is
the unit rate for Wall Cladding almost 30% higher than that for Ceiling (& Junction) Cladding?
(ii)
You have not provided:
a.
An ‘as planned & resourced schedule’ for the Wall Cladding
b.
A full breakdown of all BoQ unit rates related to Wall Cladding
c.
The causal link between each of the alleged disruption events and Contractor culpability
d.
The causal link between each of the alleged disruption events and the effect(s) / cost(s) claimed
e.
Contemporary records (capable of being objectively verified) of the work (location, quantities
and times) impacted by each of the alleged disruption events, the name, designation and role of each
person and the relevant particulars of all other resources included in the calculation of the additional
Cost claimed
f.
Actual Cost (not rates) of each resource, verified as applicable by Employment contract, salary
slip, third party order, invoice and evidence of payment.
g.
Evidence of measures taken to mitigate the effects of each disrupting event
(iii)
You have not abated actual Cost for:
a.
Subcontractor risk events e.g. errors in tender, quality and quantity of resources, supervision,
availability of materials and equipment, weather, defective work etc.
b.
Duplication of resources (in particular Supervision, Foreman and Scaffold) included in your
valuation of variations and other claims e.g. Prolongation Cost Claim.

c.
Items that you failed to timely notify and/or claim as variations e.g. instructed changes in the
design and/or sequence and/or method of executing the works
d.
Items that you failed to timely notify and/or claim that have prejudiced any related entitlement
we might otherwise have had to make a ‘back-to-back’ claim against the Employer or to levy a backcharge against a subcontractor
Whilst your claim submission is voluminous, size is no substitute for quality; it is of a global nature,
largely vague and its shortcomings readily evident in the few pages pertaining to your valuation and also
in your subsequent attempts to provide the further information we have requested. The single sheet of
A4 that you adduce as evidence of the (otherwise unsupported) actual cost of scaffolding deployed for
Wall Cladding is typically deficient, includes a period beyond that over which you say the disrupted Wall
Cladding Works were executed and in any event falls within the ambit of (iii) c. and d. above.
Your selective citation of the UAE law that you ostensibly interpret to support your failure to comply
with your contractual obligations regarding the timely notification and valuation of claims must of
course be read in the context of the entire law. In this regard we note the following provisions of the
UAE Civil Code, relating to the status of the terms and conditions to which the parties to a contract have
expressly agreed
Article 243(2)
With regard to the rights (obligations) arising out of the contract, each of the contracting parties must
perform that which the contract obliges him to do
Article 265(1)
If the wording of a contract is clear, it may not be departed from by way of interpretation to ascertain
the intention of the parties
Arbitral tribunals and the courts will therefore ordinarily apply the agreed terms and conditions of
contract if the wording and intention is clear.
In summary, we are confident in our rejection of your claim and that an impartial third party would
similarly find your claim lacking in the fundamental elements and detail necessary to make any award.
We therefore maintain our view that your submitted claim has no merit and of our valuation of it as Nil.
We shall respond to you separately regarding the other claims that you have submitted for alleged
disruption that we have also assessed as lacking in the fundamental elements and detail necessary to
make any award.
Yours faithfully,
