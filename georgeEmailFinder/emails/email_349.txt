Provision of Additional Data Outlets for Existing Flight Information Display Screens to Check-In
Island in Sector 5.22B to Level L2.0 – Engineer’s Response to RFI/0401/17254 – Request for Engineer’s
Instruction and Variation Order
Dear Sir
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and/or disruption to the Works and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
The matters described in Annex A concern delays associated with the provision of additional data
outlets required to Sector 5.22B to L2.0, introduced through the response to RFI/0401/17254.
Potential Impact
Delays and disruption due to the events and circumstances outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
likely to impact on achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within seven (7) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
On 2 July 2019, we raised RFI/0401/17254 (dated 30 June 2019) entitled ‘Data outlets removed for
existing FIDS [Flight Information Display Screens] (check-in L2.0-5.22B)’, having identified in certain

information previously provided by the Engineer relating to the location and quantity of data points to
the FIDS, where the data points had previously been deleted; requesting your advice on the same.
Despite us requesting that you reply to RFI/0401/17254 by 10 July 2019, you failed to respond until 14
calendar days later i.e. on 24 July 2019, as shown in Table 1 below. Moreover, your response directed
us to reinstate the FIDS outlets as per the sketch attached thereto (Figure 1 below refers).

It is patently clear that the information reflected in the ‘modified’ sketch attached to your response to
RFI/0401/17254 represents a change to the existing design and a change to our scope of works.
This is likely to involve inter alia the pulling of new data cables to the new location from the nearest
Satellite Communication Room (SCR) by the Information Technology subcontractor, BOND.
In order for us to undertake and instigate changes such as those noted herein, we will require fully
coordinated revised IFC Drawings encapsulating the changes introduced in your RFI response, and
further remind you that SAA8 laid down mandatory procedures to be followed if additional works are
required, in so far as an EI and VO are needed for us to proceed with the aforementioned changes.
The provisions of Clauses 2.29 to 2.31 of SAA8’ pertaining to Variations are clear; we are not to proceed
with any Variation unless a Variation Order and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. In which
respect, it is your obligation to issue this Record first if you wish to instigate change; this is only after the
additional time and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.
Therefore, until such time as you take the action required of you in accordance with SAA8 Clause 2.29,
we are unable to proceed with implementing the changes noted above and will continue to proceed in
accordance with the existing IFC design to the extent we are able to. We trust this is clear.
Potential Impact:
We note that the foregoing events and/or circumstances may delay completion of Section 5.22B to Level
L2.0, and your / Employer’s Design Consultant’s requirement to introduce fundamental changes to the
electrical installations such as those outlined above, particularly at such a late stage of the Project, will
invariably impact on our ability to obtain the Building Completion certificate (BCC).
This is essential to achieving Milestone MS09B and may impact MS09C (Substantial Completion).
Yours faithfully,
