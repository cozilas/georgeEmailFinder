Re: Wall Starter Reinforcement Certification

Dear Sir,
With reference to the above subject regarding the wall starter reinforcement certification, and in
response to your letter ref: (2) above wherein you stated that:
“… in clause 4.4, that the works are on a Lump Sum basis and that you have been given ample
opportunity to check and verify quantities and have done so to your satisfaction. On this basis, there is
no requirement for a Variation Order to be issued as the quantity risk is included within your scope of
work”,

we wish to respond as follows.
We note that our Contract and the scope of works has been agreed and has been and continues to be
certified on a re-measurable basis. This is clearly, stated under the Letter of Acceptance (LoA) Clause 4.2,
which specifically states that “…The Contract is in re-measurable basis…”. Therefore, your comment that
the works are on a Lump Sum basis is not correct and is refuted.
For the avoidance of doubt, we have attached hereto an extract of the LoA page 6 of 8, for your
reference, wherein clause 4.2 is shown. It is worth mentioning that Clause 4.4 which was referenced in
your abovementioned letter ref: (2), is clearly not applicable as seen in the attached extract of the LoA.
In addition, we put on record that to date as per Interim Payment Application No. 6, the total amount
which has been incorrectly not certified by you associated with the wall starters is AED 160,135.81.
Therefore, we kindly request you to proceed with all necessary actions to correct and certify the works
and include the wall starter quantity within the wall reinforcement accordingly, as explained in our
letter ref: (1).
In view of the above, we reiterate that our position remains as comprehensively set out in our letter ref:
(1) above, and we kindly request that the amount of AED 160,135.81, is corrected in the next Interim
Payment Certificate and is released for payment to us accordingly.

We trust you find the aforementioned self-explanatory, and you will carry out the necessary action as a
matter of urgency.
Yours faithfully,
