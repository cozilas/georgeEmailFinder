Dear Sir,
We write with regards to the enclosed letter received from M/S Jangho with photos evidence which is
self-explanatory.
Further to our review on the content of M/S Jangho’s letter, we regret to inform you that apparently
your site personnel have damaged some of the completed paint works on aluminium profile and steel
transoms negligently while carrying out your works. You are hereby requested to review the contents of
M/S Jangho’s letter and their intention to claim for the damages.
Meanwhile, we request you to provide a comprehensive explanation to enable our assessment on the
same within seven (7) days of the receipt of this letter. Failing such, we shall hold you responsible and
back charge all the reinstatement cost and other associated cost from your account according to the
Conditions of Subcontract Agreement Clause 10.3 (Contractor’s Claims) and Clause 12.12 (Other
Contractors and Other Subcontractors) whereby you are liable for the loss and damages arising out of
your action.
Should you have any queries, please do not hesitate to discuss further.
This is for your information and record.
Yours faithfully,
