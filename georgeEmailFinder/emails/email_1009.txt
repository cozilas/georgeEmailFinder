Subject: Delay Notice No. 1031 - Settlement of Manholes and Pipelines along the
Dear Sir,
Perimeter of the Main Terminal Building- Unforeseeable Physical Conditions
The Contractor writes with reference to the Geotechnical Report undertaken by Robert Bird, in relation
to
the settlement of the manholes and pipelines, issued under letter ref: (6) following receipt of the NCRs
(1),
(2) and {4), as well as refers to the Contractor's previous letter ref: {3) and Engineer's letter ref: {5).
The content of the Geotechnical Report is self-explanatory. As previously advised under letter ref: {6), it
is
evidently clear that the settlement of the manholes and pipes is not attributable to the Contractor, with
the Geotechnical Report stating conclusively that inter alia " ... a review of the project specification
requirements, testing of backfill material, RFI documents and field testing records concluded that TCA JV
has met the requirements as set out by the project and agreed with the client's representatives"
The physical conditions that have contributed in causing settlement of the manholes and pipelines could
not have reasonably been foreseen. Accordingly we hereby give the Engineer notice of the same
pursuant
to Clause 12.18.2 Conditions of Contract. It is also clear that whichever of the four strategies advised of
in
the Geotechnical Report are selected by the Engineer as being the adopted method for remedying the
settled manholes and pipework, will impact upon the Contractor's ability to achieve Milestones MS09A1
(Pier 2 Taking Over), MS09A2 (Pier 3 Taking Over), MS09A3 {Pier 1 Taking Over), and MS09A4 {Pier 4
Taking Over), plus Milestones MS09B {Substantial Completion) and MS10 (Completion of NOTP).

Therefore in accordance with Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1, the Contractor
hereby
notifies the Engineer of its entitlement to claim:
(i) An extension of the Time for Completion of the Works pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.1(b) (iii); and
(ii) An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.2 pursuant to Sub-Clause 12.18
'Unforeseeable Physical Conditions'.
Yours faithfully,
