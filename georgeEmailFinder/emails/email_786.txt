Subject:Re: On Account Cashflow Assistance Payment
Dear Sir,
We are in receipt of your letter referenced (2), wherein you have commented on our letter referenced
(1) regarding our offer for on-account payments. In view of your requests for additional AED 25 million
and on recovery principles of on-account payments, please consider following:
1.
Please note that at this stage of the project it is not possible to release further on-account
payments than the ones discussed in our previous correspondences. We reiterate that the payments
have been released for cashflow assistance. As explained in our previous correspondences, we have
already released AED 25 million against your claims for EOT and Prolongation costs, whereas our audit
of the costs you have submitted is only AED 17 million, which still requires an assessment for the TIA.
2.
On-account payments will be recovered from your final payment and not against your interim
progress payments. Moreover, please note that upon receipt of the second payment of AED 15 mil, the
total amount to be recovered is AED 55 million.
Based on the above, an additional payment of AED 25 million is not possible at this stage as it will
exceed our assessment of your final forecast cost. We trust that the additional AED 30 mil to be released
shall be sufficient for your cashflow issues at this stage.
We hope that the above clarifies our position in the matter.
Yours faithfully,
