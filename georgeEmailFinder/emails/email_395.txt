Subject: Loose soil permeation grouting under manholes and pipes
Dear Sirs,
We refer to above noted letter (1), further clarified instruction (2), weekly progress meetings on
MTB Subsidence Works and hereby submit enclosed comparison sheet for the tender carried out
for Pier 4 Area Grouting Works (Attachment-!}.
Kindly note that all bidders have been requested to price the works under equal terms and
conditions, with the consideration of same timeline.
While reviewing the comparison sheet, please consider following:
1. All bids are re-measure basis (Bauer on point base, Zetas and Keller on linear meter
drilling, tam pipe and grouting), i.e. in case the grout quantity changes or the depth of
rock layer is reached at a shallower level than 12 meters, there can be saving in Zetas
and Keller prices.
2. All parties have bid on red and yellow zones -total price for each package comprises
both zones.
3. All parties have bid on UFC and OPC+SR basis, this is clearly identified in the
comparison sheet. UFC is available within 15 days according to ZETAS, 4-5 weeks
according to BAUER and KELLER.
4. Additional test and verification requirements (being not available on site) has been
priced by Zetas only, Keller's response pending.
You are kindly requested to advise on following:
1. Which subcontractor to be used for Pier 4 works
2. Approval of Zetas and Keller as subcontractor for remaining works, to enable
competitive bidding
3. Exact instruction in respect of what type of cement is to be used where (not only for
this area, for future as well), in consideration with the fact that UFC can be made
available 4-5 week longest
Yours faithfully,
