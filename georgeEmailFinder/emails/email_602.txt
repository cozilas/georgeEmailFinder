Re: Coordination for SOC Fit-out - Floor Boxes

Dear Sir,
We are in receipt of your letter referenced (1) above, wherein you have requested us to use the
furniture overlay drawings enclosed therein, to coordinate the works as per the subject. Please be
informed that the works for the floor box coordination have been executed and approved on site
following the A16 IFC drawings and the shopdrawings, enclosed herewith.
The drawings received via your letter referenced (1), introduced a new setting-out from the one
implemented as per the aforementioned. Specifically, after reviewing the drawings in your mentioned
letter, it has been found that there are differences between the implemented coordinated
works/drawings and the new setting-out received via your letter. As per the new drawings, some of the
floor boxes have been relocated and some of the floor boxes have not been reflected in the new settingout drawings. In addition, there are many changes in the floor boxes locations and quantities which will
affect the under-floor containment, raised floor, and the carpet above. All these works have been
completed, inspected, and the SOC room has been handed over.
In view of the above, we regret to inform you that we are unable to implement the new changes,
without having abortive works and a consequent additional cost and time impact. Therefore, you are
kindly requested to consider our comments herewith and inform us of your decision, accordingly.
In the event the Engineer wishes to proceed with the above mentioned works, it will constitute a
Variation and requires the issuance of a formal instruction to proceed with the works pursuant to
20.1.1(b) [Variations and Adjustments] of the Conditions of Contract and the procedure set down in SubClause 2.29 of Settlement Agreement and Amendment Number 8, to enable the Contractor to proceed
with the additional works.
Yours faithfully,
