Dear Sir,
Contractor writes to Subcontractor with reference to Engineer's Instruction No. 85 received via above
referenced letter in the matter of Tunnel Segment Repair which is self-explanatory and Subcontractor is
instructed that the same will be applicable back to back for above captioned subcontract.

As required by Engineer regarding detailed cost assessment of any potential impact, Subcontractor is
informed to provide the same by 22Â°d July 2015 for contractor to vet and forward to Engineer. However
Contractor wishes to make it clear that merely forwarding the cost assessment provided by
Subcontractor do not make it accepted by Contractor.

If by not receiving such an assessment or Engineer not accepting provided cost assessment, Contractor
is imposed with any cost determination by Engineer, same will be the liability of Subcontractor.

Subcontractor is informed that this instruction will supersede all the previous communications on the
same matter in the captioned subcontract.

Yours faithfully,
