Delay Notice No. 510 – Delayed completion of Works to GH36 due to incomplete MTA
Contractor’s Works & Engineer’s failure to provide No Objection Certificate
Dear Sir,
The Contractor hereby submits this Delay Notice No. 510 in accordance with Conditions of Contract (CC)
Clause 16.5.2 and Sub-Clause 27.1.1, in respect of the delays to completion of the Contractor’s Works to
Gatehouse GH36, due to incomplete Works of the Main Terminal Airfield Contractor to GH36.
1.0
Basis of Claim
Background
1.1
According to Conditions of Contract (CC) Clause 12.12 (‘Other Contractors’) and in particular,
Sub-Clause 12.12.1, the Contractor agrees that its access to the Site of the Works is not exclusive and
that Other Contractors may perform work on the Site concurrently with the Works.
1.2
Accordingly CC-12.12.2, places a contractual obligation upon the Contractor to ensure that it
shall:
“(a)
cooperate with the Other Contractors to ensure the coordination of the work of the Other
Contractors with the execution of the Works including timeframes, programmes and schedules for
completion of the Works;
(b)
take such actions as are necessary to facilitate the works of Other Contractor, including
providing Other Contractors with access to all essential services and amenities and any places where
work is being carried out or materials are being prepared and stored; and
(c)
Take such actions as are necessary not to delay or disrupt any Other Contractor.
1.3
On this basis therefore, it is reasonable to assume the Employer has placed reciprocal
contractual obligations upon its MTA Contractor to cooperate with the MTB Contractor and take such
actions as are necessary to facilitate the works of the MTB Contractor, including providing the MTB
Contractor with access to any places where work is being carried out; and to coordinate its works so as
not to obstruct, disrupt or delay work being performed by the MTB Contractor.
1.4
In the event however, despite the MTA Contractor’s Works planning to have completed its
works to Gatehouse GH36 on or before 27 May 2016 [in conjunction with and by arrangement with the
Engineer], this proved not to be the case at all. In fact at the date of preparing this Delay Notice (20 July
2016), the MTA Contractor’s Works to Gatehouse GH36 remains incomplete and as such has and
continued to prevent the MTB Contractor from constructing and completing its Envelope Works and
chilled water pipes from GH36 to Pier 3 (i.e. to Gatehouse GH36).
1.5
It is this that represents the basis of claim outlined below.
Chronology of Delays
1.6
On 21 April 2016, the Contractor received the Engineer’s Transmittal Advice No. MTC-CMA-TCA0401-TML-03759 dated 19 April 2016, attached to which was a ‘Renewal – Early Access NOC for Fire Line
in GH36 & 37’ (essentially consisting of a letter from the MTA Contractor dated 12 April 2016, ref:
MTA/LNT/CMA/0415/CON/02333 and accompanying layout highlighting the relevant part of Area 36
and 37 required to carry out fire line works. Included as part of the attachments to was a copy of NOC
No. 2333 dated 12 April 2016. This identified amongst other things that the noted Works would last 30
days. Therefore, on the basis the NOC was signed off on 27 April 2016, meant that the Works were
planned to be completed on or before 27 May 2015.
1.6.1 The Contractor was required to review and sign the NOC and return the original, which he duly
did by way on 1 May 2016 (letter 28 April 2015, ref: MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/007555).
1.7
In the event however, despite the NOC ‘expiring’ on 27 May 2015, the Contractor records that at
the date of preparing this Delay Notice (which is 20 July 2016) the MTA Contractor’s Works to
Gatehouse GH36 remain incomplete; and furthermore, according to the attached photograph taken by
the Contractor on 17 July 2016, is unlikely to be completed anytime soon.

1.8
The MTA Contractor’s Works that are still to be completed to GH36, consist of inter alia:
1.8.1 Paved Quality Concrete (PQC) works;
1.8.2 Firefighting Pipes;
1.8.3 Firefighting connection to MTB;
1.8.4 Storm lines; and
1.8.5 LV duct connecting to GH36.
1.8.6 This Contractor considers this also constitutes a failure on the part of the Engineer for not
managing the Works, activities and progress of the Employer’s Other Contractors
1.9
Currently however, the delays are on-going and therefore installation of the Contractor’s Works
such as Fireproofing, Cladding and Façade Works to GH36, are continuing to be delayed by the noncompletion by the MTA Contractor of the PQC, Firefighting pipework and storm lines etc.
Impact of the Delay
1.10 The non-completion of the MTA Contactor’s Works to GH36 (such as but not limited to the PQC,
Firefighting pipework and storm lines noted above), is impacting and will continue to impact upon the
Contractor’s ability to install inter alia, the Fireproofing, Cladding and Façade Works to GH36.
1.11 In view of this, the Engineer is urged to forthwith instruct the MTA Contractor to complete its
works to Gatehouse GH36 without further undue delay.
1.12 Meanwhile, owing to the incomplete works and delays of the MTA Contractor to GH36, and the
effect this will invariably have on the Works, the Contractor issues this Delay Notice No. 510.
Summary
1.13 The Contractor will continue to review the foregoing delaying event in order to assess the full
extent of the direct and consequential delays to construction and completion of the Envelope, and
associated works to Gatehouse GH36 due to the incomplete works of the MTA Contractor, and the
impact that such delays have had and is continuing to have on the Works, the findings of which will be
submitted to the Engineer in due course, pursuant to the requirement of CC-27.1.5.
2.0
Date Basis of Claim is Discovered
2.1
The Contractor considers that the date the basis of claim was discovered is 17 July 2015, which
represents the date the above noted e-mail was sent to the Engineer and the date on which the
attached photos were taken; evidencing the incomplete works of the MTA Contractor to GH36.
3.0
Relevant Contract Provisions
1.14 The Contractor’s entitlement to an extension to the extended date for Completion of Milestones
(principally Milestones 9 and 10 ), and any associated additional and/or abortive costs arises from:
1.14.1 a breach of the Contract or act of prevention on the part of the Employer, the Employer’s
Personnel, the Consultants or the Other Contractors pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.1 (c).
1.15 The impact that this delaying event will have on the Clause 16.3 Programme (Rev. 6.2) approved
(Code 2) by the Engineer on 9 July 2015, will be determined by a Time Impact Analysis (TIA) pursuant to
Clause 27.2 of the Conditions of Contract.
1.16 This notice is without prejudice to the Contractor’s entitlement arising from other delaying
events or circumstances that are the subject of compensable acceleration programmes and/or claims
submitted to the Engineer.
1.17 The detailed particulars associated with the delays to construction and completion of the MTB
Contractor’s Envelope Works to GH36 (recorded and described above) due to the non-completion of the
Works and delays of the MTA Contractor to Area 36 will be provided in due course.
Yours faithfully,
