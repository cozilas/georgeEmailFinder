Subject: Â· Concurrent Delay for EOT 1
Dear sir
We write in response to the Engineer's Jetter reference (1) and the Employer's letter reference (2).
There
are couple points that the Engineer and Employer have raised in their letters that require a response.
(1) The Employer cites the "Abu Dhabi Government Construction Contract" as an "excellent example of
industry practice". The Contractor disagrees that this is relevant or helpful.
a) The Abu Dhabi Government Construction Contract is the Abu Dhabi Government's Construction
Contract. It is wholly self-serving for the Employer to use as evidence of an allegedly established
and agreed industry practice an affiliate's. contract. The use by one entity of their own in-house
standard form contract does not make the approach in that contract industry practice.
b) In any event, the Employer accepts that the Contract here does not treat concurrency the same
way as the Abu Dhabi Government Construction Contract. According to the Employer, a
contractor operating under the Abu Dhabi Government Construction Contract does not receive an
extension of time or costs for concurrent delay, whereas under the Contract here, the Contractor
receives an extension of time but no costs for "Concurrent Delay." It is thus apparent that this
was not the approach the Parties adopted. Rather, the Parties modeled the identification and
treatment of concurrent delay on widely accepted industry guidance emanating from England.
c) The Employer fails to cite any definition of concurrent delay used in the Abu Dhabi Government
Construction Contract. Further, the Employer states that "[t]here is limited binding precedent of
court decisions and limited court report. Arbitration decisions are generally confidential."
Therefore, the Employer's argument begs the question of what "concurrent delay" means under
the Abu Dhabi Government Construction Contract. Nor does the Employer attempt to align the
Abu Dhabi Government Construction Contract's definition of concurrent delay with that which the
Parties used here.
d) The Employer fails to explain why the wording of Clause 1.1 is taken directly from English
precedent. It strains credulity to argue that the Parties accidentally used this precise language,
especially given the sophistication of the Parties and that the Contractor is a multinational joint
venture.
(2) Both the Engineer and the Employer reference the Contractor's letter (4) to suggest that the
Contractor has objected in the past to the use of the SCL Protocol. It is unclear what the purpose is of
that
reference. However, to be clear, the quote is taken out of context. The issue being addressed in that
letter related to the method of presentation of a concurrent delay assessment that the Engineer and

Employer insisted upon. It had nothing to do with the definition of Concurrent Delay.
Except for the points addressed above, the Contractor relies upon its letter reference (3), which
dispatches
with the remainder of the Engineer's and Employer's arguments.
Yours faithfully,
