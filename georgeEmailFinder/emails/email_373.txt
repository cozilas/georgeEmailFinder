Subject:Post SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0115
Delays to Installation of Displays due to Other Contractor (Info Booths)
Dear Sirs,
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
Table 1 to Annex A lists various IFC Drawings showing the intended location of numerous Information
Booths that have not yet been installed by the Employer’s Other Contractor (TAV Technologies).
Without these, we are prevented from completing the associated information Displays.

Potential Impact
Acts of prevention on the part of others such as that outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
increasingly likely to impact on achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within seven (7) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
Table 1 below lists various IFC Drawings which show the intended location of numerous ‘Information
Booths’ that have not yet been installed by the Employer’s Other Contractor (TAV Technologies).
Consequently, unless and until these booths are installed, then we are unable to install the ‘Displays’ at
inter alia the Disruptive Flights Counter, Information Booths and Information Desk to CP Level L2.0.

Resultant Impact:
It is therefore clear that our ability to complete the installation of ‘Displays’ and associated works to the
areas indicated in the IFC Drawings referenced in Table 1 are being delayed by acts of prevention on the
part of the Employer and / or the Employer’s Other Contractor. If matters continue, then this will have
wider ramifications; not only on installations but will also impact Testing and Commissioning which will
invariably knock on and impact upon our ability to achieve Milestone MS09B. Similarly, this has the
potential to prevent us from achieving Substantial Completion (i.e. Milestone MS09C).
Yours faithfully,
