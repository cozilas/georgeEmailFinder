Dear Sir,
We refer to Contractor's letter reference M006-GDB-PRJ-lTR-00031 and comment as follows.

General Conditions of Contract (Volume 3, Appendix 2, Annexure 1) provides for 'Option KITO date to be
agreed' when the Option is exercised before trigger date I event. Annexure 1 also states: 'Option KITO
date to be agreed means that the Engineer will determine a fair adjustment to the affected KITO dates
and the corresponding Time for Complet ion due to the works being instructed before the Trigger Date'.

Activation of this Option includes omission of the Railway Facility Structure (RFS). Volume 5, Appendix F
provides for STKID.01, STKID.02, STK ID.03 and STTO for the RFS at Al Aziziyah. As noted above, the
Contract allows for the Engineer to determine a fair adjustment of (these) affected KITO dates, as Al
Aziziyah RFS is being omitted and Al Aziziyah Station is being added.

The Contractor is required to comply with letter reference M006-LBE-PR J- TR-00030 in this regard.

The Engineer's Assistant is available to meet in order to conclude matter relating to this topic at your
earliest convenience.

Yours faithfully,
