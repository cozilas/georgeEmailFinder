Subject: MTB- Defective AHUs
Dear Sir,
We refer to your letter (1) on the subject and note your concerns regarding the defects in the AHUs
within the CP and Piers.
We disagree with your statement: 'The Contractor has failed to take action to rectify these defective
works, which pose a serious risk to the completion of the works.'
We have been working closely with your team to address the defects highlighted in the NCRs issued
to us, related to the AHUs, many of which have been attended to.
During daily on-site meetings, workshops and through close coordination with your team, we are
prioritizing work fronts to expedite the defects in a timely manner.
We are committed to closing out all the defects as early as practicable, without compromising on
quality and safety.
Yours faithfully,
