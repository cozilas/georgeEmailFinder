Subject North Ramp- Preparation in the event of Rainfall
Dear Sir,
The Engineer has observed that the North Ramp has been covered with a membrane and ballasted
with excavated material by the Landscaping Contractor to protect the road surface as required by the
Contractor in line with their conditional approval of the NOC (ref: BAE-021) - refer to the attached
photographs taken on 03 February 2020.
Following the recent rainfall event of 10 and 11 January 2020, and the water ingress into the MTB
from the North Ramp and as highlighted in (1L the Engineer reminds the Contractor of their interface
obligations with interfacing Contractors and their responsibilities under the Contract for the care and
protection of their own works. To this extent, the Contractor is to immediately coordinate with the
landscaping Contractor and arrive at a mutual solution to protect the road and ensure that the grated
drainage channel is clean to accept any surface water discharge as to prevent the ingress of surface
water into the MTB.
The Contractor is to give this their immediate action considering the risk of further inclement weather.
Yours faithfully,
