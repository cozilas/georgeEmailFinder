Dear Sir,

The Contractor's proposal to amend the period within which the Contractor is required to send to the
Engineer a fully detailed claim as set out in Sub-Clause 20.1.6 is approved.

The proposed period within which the Contractor is required to submit a fully detailed claim
corresponding to Notice of Claim No.062 is 42 days, ending on 18 August 2016, automat ically renewed
by a further 42 days, on a rollirl basis. Either Party can terminate the rolling extension by issuing a 28
days' notice to the other Party.

Yours faithfully,
