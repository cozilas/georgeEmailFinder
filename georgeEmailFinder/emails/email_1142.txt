Subject:Re: Notification of Back Charge-Temporary Power Connections to P3 & P4
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to the enclosed letters received from M/s Anel referenced through (2) to (5)
and our letter reference (1) regarding the aforesaid subject. We regret to inform you that due to your
continual delays and your lack of performance have resulted to time delays which subsequently affected
other trades.
As discussed in our letter reference (1) your failure to deliver equipment bands, light boxes and glass
screens timeously, has resulted in the temporary termination of electrical works and subsequent
abortive works, in the subject areas performed by M/s ANEL.
In view of the above and in continuation to references (1) and (2) to (5) enclosed herewith, you are
notified that the abortive works as described in the enclosed letters, will be backcharged including all
associated amount(s) from your account pursuant to Clauses 10.3 [Contractor's Claims] and Clause
12.12 [Other Contractors and Other Subcontractors].
It is noted that your delays have been an ongoing issue which has been notified to you in numerous
correspondences. Moreover, we write to express our disappointment that the situation has not
improved despite our recurrent instructions to proceed with the works without any delay. You are
hereby reminded of your obligations as set out under the Subcontract Clause 16.1.1 [Commencement of
Subcontract Works] which states that you are obliged to progress the Subcontract Works with due
expedition and without delay, and should neither delay nor adversely affect the performance of TCAJV
or Other Subcontractors.
Concluding the above, you are to implement mitigation measures to increase the efficiency of the
construction of the Subcontract Works and coordinate with other Subcontractors to avoid further
progress issues.
Please be informed that all associated delays, costs, losses and/or expenses incurred by the Contractor
and/or other Contractors and/or Subcontractors and the Employer, arising as a result of the above, shall
be recovered from you in accordance with the Subcontract Clauses 10.3 [Contractorâ€™s Claims], and
16.6.1 [Delay Damages] in addition to other relevant Contract Clauses.
This is for your information record and necessary action
Yours faithfully,
