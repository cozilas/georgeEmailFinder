Instruction / Variation Order
Dear Sir
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described below
may cause delay and/or disruption to the Works; hence we seek your swift resolution of the same.
The Event(s):
Between 30 July 2018 and 9 June 2019 we submitted the following seven (7) RFIs, requesting further
clarification and resolution of what is in effect design related issues affecting a corresponding number of
doors (7 nos.) to various areas and levels of the Main Terminal Building (Table 1 refers).

Firstly, we wish to record that 4 out of the 7 RFIs identified in Table 1 above (items 1, 2, 4 and 5), were
not responded by you within the times expressly required by us. At this stage of the Project, for you to
take upwards of 38 calendar days to reply and respond to the various matters identified therein (as per
Item 1, i.e. RFI/0401/16346), is wholly unacceptable and will invariably knock on and have a
consequential impact on our progress and delay us; this delay was otherwise wholly avoidable.
Secondly, we further record that although RFI/0401/16346 was submitted on 30 July 2018, i.e. prior to
the ‘Effective Date’ included in SAA8 (4 September 2018), you failed to reply until 27 September 2018.
This cannot possibly be construed as forming part of or ‘Included Circumstances’ (per Clause 1.7.4 of
SAA8) and will be included within any forthcoming Time Impact Analysis, albeit in recognition of the
Effective Date included in SAA8, any delays will be analysed from 4 September 2018 onwards.
Furthermore, we wish to put on record that your responses to all seven (7) RFIs summarised in Table 1
above, introduced substantial changes to our original scope of Works, including but not limited to
changes to Doors, Doors Hardware, Fire/Acoustic Rating, SACS, Handing etc. Moreover, such changes
will result in the following, involving coordination of numerous subcontractors and/or manufacturers:
•
Procurement and installation of new doors hardware;
•
Procurement and installation of new doors;
•
Installation of Door Control Units (DCUs) and wiring;
•
Installation of wiring to comply with the SACS changes introduced;
•
Doors may need to be shipped back to the manufacturer for fire rating labelling and fire rating
compliance;
•
Changes to doors SACS; and
•
Changes to the Master Key Schedule.
At Annex A hereto, we attach a comprehensive summary which compares the pre-RFI response (as
shown on the previous Door Schedule and corresponding EI) and the changes that you are seeking to
introduce through the responses to the RFIs listed in Table 1; in respect of all seven (7) doors. The
changes between the two are clearly highlighted in yellow for ease of identification and reference.
Kindly note the information recorded in table 1 and Annex A, is limited to seven (7) doors only. We are
aware that other doors may also be affected and are now in the process of consolidating more issues in
respect of more changes introduced via other Engineer’s RFI responses to other doors. Once we have
determined the outcome of this further study, we will advise you accordingly in due course.
In the meantime, as noted above, all seven (7) RFI responses attempt to introduce changes to the
existing IFC design and will require a valid Engineer’s Instruction (EI) and a Variation Order (VO).
It is become evidently clear that there are numerous unresolved issues owing to the lack of a final
overall comprehensive and clear design with all the necessary information required by us to complete
the door installation works. Notwithstanding the fact that you are aware that the majority of these
works may have already been implemented based on an earlier version of the design, the pattern
whereby you progressively revise and update the design appears to continue. This is unacceptable.
SAA8 laid down mandatory procedures to be followed if additional works are required, and you have
failed to follow these; an EI and VO are needed for us to proceed with the aforementioned changes.
We therefore take this opportunity in also reminding you of the provisions of Clauses 2.29 to 2.31 of
Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’) pertaining to Variations, in so far as we are not to
proceed with any Variation unless a Variation Order and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. In
which respect, it is your obligation to issue this Record first if you wish to instigate change; this is only
after the additional time and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.
Meanwhile, until such time as you take the action required of you in accordance with SAA8 Clause 2.29,
we are unable to proceed with implementing the changes noted above. We trust this is clear.

Potential Impact:
We note that the foregoing events and/or circumstances are undeniably delaying the installation of the
doors, doors hardware and the other door related issues. While at present this notice is limited to seven
(7) doors in particular, there are potentially other doors that will be affected also. In any event, your
requirement to introduce fundamental changes to Doors, Doors Hardware, Fire/Acoustic Rating, SACS,
Handing etc., at such a late stage of the Project, is very likely to have a direct impact upon our ability to
achieve Milestone MS09B and similarly impact MS09C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required:
It is for this reason therefore, that we issue this E-Notice requesting your prompt action, guidance,
decision or further instruction as may be applicable to resolve the matters referenced herein in order to
mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works. This includes without limitation:
1.
Issuing such Instruction as necessary for us to instigate the required changes into the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within ten (10) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
Yours faithfully,
