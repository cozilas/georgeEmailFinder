Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer's Assistant's request, the Contractor attaches full particulars of the additional
costs that it has incurred as a result of the elongation of the Souq Waqif station.

The Contractor takes this opportunity like to further elaborate on the matter of the agreement that it
considers was concluded between the Contractor and the Employer:

The scope that the Contractor has quoted for was that reflected in the Letter of Conditional Acceptance
(LOCA), which was stated by the Employer to be "in accordance with our tender document dated 16 Apr
il 2012, and all tender bulletins, clarifications, minutes and communication issued to date."

The Contractor provided his Best and Final Offer (BAFO) for the Contract Price based on the same
criteria, namely the tender and all subsequent formalcommunications prior to the LOCA.There was
never any indication in the tender or its addenda that the Souq Waqif station would require elongation.
The LOCA itself was contingent on six conditions labelled a) to f ), none of which relate to the layout of
the Souq Waqif station nor to the interface with the PEO.

The Contractor posits therefore that it has provided a price which was accepted for the construction of a
station that fit within the constraints of the information known prior to its acceptance of the LOCA, and

that information that was included in the Contract subsequent to this date should have been subject to
an adjustment to the Contract Price, or in other words a Variation under the Contract.
Yours faithfully,
