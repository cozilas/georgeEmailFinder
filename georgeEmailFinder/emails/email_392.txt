Subject SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No.0090 Overdue Responses to 534 As-Built Drawings as at 2
May 2019 and SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No.0096 Overdue

Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence (1) and (2) regarding the potential delay to the Works as a
result of alleged delays to the response of As-Built Drawings.
The Contractor is reminded that in order to avoid any potential delays, they are required to submit the
drawings in a timely manner as per Clause 3.3. f of Section 01 33 00 of the Specifications otherwise
there is no entitlement for any extension to the Time for Completion. We note that the Contractor has
failed to adhere to this requirement and we refer the Contractor to correspondence (3) to (6) wherein
all their delays in relation to the As-Built submittals as well as quality concerns regarding the Drawing
submissions are recorded .
The Contractor's delays with progressing of As Builts in a timely manner was a subject of discussions
during the Risk Committee Meetings and despite the Contractor's commitment to remedy the
identified shortfalls by mobilizing additional management and resources for these, the situation
remains the same.
Therefore, the Contractor's assertion that the alleged delay to the review of the As-Built Drawings will
potentially have an impact to their ability to achieve Substantial Completion is unfounded and the
Engineer reserves the Employer's rights pursuant to Clause 10.3 of the Conditions of Contract for any
delays which may be incurred to the Project.
Yours faithfully,
