Dear Sir,
Engineer's Assistant refers to letter mentioned above wherein Contractor was specifically requested to
submit a quotation for any cost and time impact. Contractor's response was due by 25 March 2016.

Contractor has failed to submit the quotation. This is a reminder of the obligation pursuant to SubClause
13.2.1 to submit the quotation within time specified.

Failure to respond within five (5) days of receipt of this reminder will lead the Engineer's Assistant to
consider further
tion.
Dear Sir,

Engineer's Assistant refers to letter 1) referenced above, wherein the Contractor was requested to
submit a quotation under Sub-Clauses 13.2.1 & 13.2.2. Despite reminder letters 2) and 3) referenced
above, the Contractor's continued delay in providing the quotation has prevented the Engineer from
progressing by making an informed decision under the Sub-Clause 13.2.3.

The Contractor is reminded that any abortive costs or delaylo the Time for Completion arising, directly
or indirectly as a result of the Contractor's failure to comply with obligations under Volume 3, Clause 13
'Variatirs and Adjustments', will be considered solely attributable to the Contractor's account.

Contra\or is directed to provide the quotation without any further delay.
Yours faithfully,
