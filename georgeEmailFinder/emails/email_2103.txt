Dear Sir,
The Contractor refers to letter reference 1) and the latest discussions regarding the Engineer's
Assistant's request for a revised financial proposalfor the design and construction of a Metro passage
connection between Qatar National Museum and the Museum Park.

Further to the Engineer's Assistant's request, the Contractor encloses herewith its revised financ ial
proposal with the correction of some arithmetical errors and the deletion of contingencies.

The estimated structural, civil, MEP, architectura l finishes and utility relocation design and construction
cost is provided for budgeting purposes only, and it does not include any other additional cost that may
arise as a consequence of a late Instruction, such as the cost of rework or abortive design, especially for
the Qatar National Museum station concourse level. These costs (if any) will be addressed under
separate cover.

For the avoidance of doubt, this submissions supersedes the financial proposal submitted under
reference 1).

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.
Yours faithfully,
