Subject:Notice of Variation for ESK-013 dated 5th September 2018 – Additional Isolator in L2.0 for retail
Unit
Dear Sir,
We refer to the sketch reference ESK-013 issued by you under cover of an e-mail dated 5 September
2018 in respect of a possible additional retail isolator and should be grateful if you would make clear to
your staff that no ‘changes can be formalised in due course’.
Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement and Amendment Number 8 (SAA8) Variations Clauses 2.29, 2.30
and 2.31, notwithstanding the terms of Conditions of Contract Clause 20.3 (Variation Procedure) the
Engineer shall not instruct any Variation after the Amendment Effective Date of 4 September 2018
unless all the requirements of these SAA8 Clauses have been fulfilled in their entirety.
Please let us know whether or not these changes are required, following which we will compile our cost
and programme impact (if any) proposals for your and ADAC’s agreement. If and when we receive a
Variation Order confirming agreement with our proposals we will proceed with these varied Works.
Yours faithfully,
