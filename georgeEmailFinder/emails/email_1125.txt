Subject: Lack Of Progress and Work front Availability
Dear Sir,
In response to your referenced letter "MMM/17/MTB/0223" dated 23 October 2017 and other
referenced letters listed above, you have alleged that you have no sufficient work front to enable you to
maintain your manpower and equipment fully operative for screed works.
We refute your allegations in its entirety and would clarify for the record that you have more than
10,000 m2 available work front for screed works in CP Level 2 and 3. Please refer to the attached
drawings for CP Level 2.0 and 3.0 which indicate the available work fronts for screed works. Additionally,
we are once compelled to place on record that, despite the Project being at a critical stage, we remain
increasingly concerned with regards to the inadequate rate of progress of your stone installation works
within aforementioned areas.
On the basis of above, we find your statement of the idle manpower and your equipment is spurious
and baseless. You have sufficient screed work-front which is adequate for one month ahead, in addition

to this, you have more than 15,000 m2 work-front for stone installation. Therefore, for any kind of idle
manpower and equipment claim or/and any kind of delays due to your insufficient manpower, we hold
you completely culpable associated with this element of the works. Accordingly, you are instructed to
provide an Action Plan to mitigate the delays strictly in accordance with Clause 16.4.1. As previously
stated within a plethora of correspondences, your contractual obligation to mitigate delays of which we
find you culpable.
We trust aforementioned information and instructions are self-explanatory and you will carry out the
necessary actions as a matter of urgency. Please be noted that, any delays, costs, loses and/or expenses
as a result of your failure to complete the aforementioned activities shall be solely your responsibility.
Yours faithfully,
