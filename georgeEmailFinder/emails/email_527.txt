Subject:Post SAA8 Delay Notice (‘D-Notice’) No. 0045
Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.1: Notice of Claim
Overdue Responses to the Contractor’s Architectural, Civil, and MEP Material Submittals (as at 27
January 2019)
Dear Sir
In the period between 8 November 2018 and 2 January 2019, the Contractor submitted 12 Material
Submittals containing numerous document submissions described and summarised in Annex A hereto,
relating to Architectural, Civil, and MEP works, for the Engineer’s review and approval.
Article 1.3 of Specification Section 013300 ‘Submittal Procedures’ governs the processing time by which
the Engineer is contractually obligated to respond to the Contractor’s submittals. On the basis that each
of the 12 Material Submittals listed in Annex A are shown to comprise Rev. 00 and Rev. 02 [plus Rev. 04],
submittals, then these ought to have been responded to by the Engineer 21 and 7 calendar days later
respectively, i.e. in the period between 5 December 2018 and 23 January 2019. However, Annex A
indicates that at the cut-off date associated with this Delay Notice (i.e. 27 January 2019), the Engineer
exceeded the review periods expressly stipulated in the Contract by upwards of 59 calendar days.
On 28 January 2019, the Contractor provided the Employer / Engineer, by email [12:56pm] a schedule of
these Material Submittals the responses to which were overdue, and requested the prompt review of
the same, noting that “all approvals are critical as of now”. While we appreciate the efforts that have

been expended by the Employer/Engineer to date in assisting the approval process to some of these
submittals in order for us to obtain a Status Code 2 or higher, the fact of the matter is they are still
overdue.
In view of this, the Contractor contends that the foregoing constitutes a breach of Contract and/or an
act of prevention on the part of the Employer’s Personnel and / or Consultants. Therefore, in
accordance with Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which pursuant to SAA8 SubClause 1.1 have not been amended by SAA8], the Contractor hereby notifies the Engineer of its
entitlement to claim:
(i)
An extension of the Time for Completion of the Works pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c); and
(ii)
An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.2 pursuant to Clause 9.10, or,
in the alternative, damages for breach of Contract.
Interim and / or final details of the Time impacts and adjustment to the Contract Price, will be provided
in due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.5(a), (b) and (c).
Yours faithfully,
