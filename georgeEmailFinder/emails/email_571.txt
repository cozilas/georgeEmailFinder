Subject:Re: Incident Reports; Damages to installed works
Dear Sir,
We are in receipt of your letters referenced (1 to 25) above, in which you informed us about the
incidents regarding scratches on stainless steel surfaces, accumulated dirt/stain, damages by others and
cable management by others which you alleged has resulted in damage to or mismanagement of some
of your works.
Please be informed that snagging is currently ongoing, where all issues including but not limited to the
aforementioned are being examined. After the completion of the snagging we will inform you
accordingly regarding the course of action to be taken for these matters.
In the meantime, if you believe you are entitled to additional costs in regards to any repair and/or
replacements, you are hereby requested to submit further particulars for the associated costs and
programme impact accordingly.
Moreover, where the damages are caused by other Subcontractors, you are advised to specifically
identify the responsible party and/or the root cause by submitting adequate evidence in order for us to
notify such party accordingly. In case you wish to pursue a claim against another Subcontractor, the
onus is on you to provide correct particulars in the form of substantiation/evidence of the incident for
our assessment and to inform the parties involved accordingly. In the interim we have forwarded the
damages to the MEP Subcontractors concerning the cable management installation.
We are also taking this opportunity to remind you of your obligations under Subcontract Clauses 15.6.2
[Passing of risk and title], 24.2.1 and 24.2.2 [Subcontractor’s Care of the Subcontract Works] to protect
your works until ownership transfers to the Employer upon Taking over Certificate in accordance with
Subcontract Clause 18 [Contractor’s Taking Over].
Yours faithfully,
