Dear Sir,

In response to letter referenced above and as a result of workshops and meeting held, QR and NMoQ
have reached the following consensus:

QR will construct up to ground level, install VHTS and MEP and provide a Type E open balustrade plus
pop up for the lift. This is a completed functional entrance. Typical architectural renders are attached.

QR shall also liaise with the NMoQ to provide a base slab suitable for construction by NMoQ of entrance
structure/ cafe on the slab at a later date. This may involve partial or complete removal of the QR atgrade structure, and coordination shall be as defined in the Agreement.

The NMoQ shall provide FOC granite setts for the run off area of the escalator and the lift, and QR will
install these - slab levels shall be designed to accommodate the setts and allow for a later screed and
floor finish.

The NMoQ shall be responsible for branding of at-grade structure.
QR shall be responsible for MEP installation and branding of their own works. QR will redraft the
Agreement to reflect said agreement as above.
Yours faithfully,
