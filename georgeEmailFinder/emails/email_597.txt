Subject:Settlement Agreement and Amendment 8
Dear Sir,
We acknowledge receipt of your letter MTC-CMA-TCA-0401-LTR-10157 dated 14 November 2018 and
using your notation respond as follows:
1.&2. Our client is aware of the situation in respect of Bonds and Subcontractor Claims: we have also
confirmed the position in respect of Parent Company Guarantees.
3. Given the highly positive if not delighted reaction of all parties involved in the project, to the
successful
demonstration of the BHS we are surprised at your binary view on the clear achievement of the principle
requirements of MS07. You will be aware that the Employer has expressed his view in this respect and
that the relevant Activity Payment has been certified.
4. It seems you may not be aware that SAA8 was executed on the understanding that a supplemental
agreement is to be issued covering, inter alia, reimbursement of costs in respect of the rectification of
the
subsidence issues. The Parties discussed the particular issues involved in us carrying out the initial
subsidence investigation Works and agreed these were envisaged by that supplemental agreement. The
matters covered by our letter 013787 dated 10 November 2018 fall within this category and tlnerefore
to
maintain compliance with SAA8 and its supplemental agreement we requested a Variation Order be
issued.
5. We have attended each Risk Mitigation Committee (RCM} meeting and confirm that a number of
events
or circumstances have been notified by e-mail and that the agenda for the meeting is set by prior
meeting
action points together with these notices. We believe the RCM meetings are progressing in the positive
manner envisaged by SAA8 and therefore do not recognise your criticism.
We remain available to discuss any matters that may be of concern to you but trust this letter clarifies
these particular matters.
Yours faithfully
