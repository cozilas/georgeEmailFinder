Subject:Clause 27.1.1: Notice of Claim – Delay Notice No. 0018
[Late and Unreasonable] Code 3 Electrical Shop Drawings and Document Submittals
(SDS/0401/E/0648-04,
SDS/0401/E/0956-02,
SDS/0401/E/0962-02,
SDS/0401/E/0976-02,
SDS/0401/E/0087-09, and DS/0401/13003-00)
Dear Sir
We refer to E-Notice No. 0018 ref: (1) [copy attached] issued on or about 19 December 2018.
Our e-notice was predominantly premised on the unreasonable Status Code 3 comments endorsed on a
number of our Electrical Shop Drawings and Electrical Document Submittals issued to you in the period
up to 10 October 2018 (the information recorded in Tables 1 and 2 to Annex A hereto refers). The
unreasonable comments and our responses to them are provided in Table 3 [to Annex A].
While acknowledging that the responses to most of these Shop Drawing and Document Submittals were
received prior to the Effective Date contained within SAA8, i.e. 4 September 2018, the response to the
submittal detailed at item 5 of Table 1 was not. We therefore take this further opportunity in reminding
you that the response was late and overdue when compared with the response times expressly stated in
Article 1.3 of Specification Section 013300 ‘Submittal Procedures’. In fact, Table 1 of Annex A shows
that at date of preparing E-Notice No. 0018 (19 December 2018), you exceeded the review period
expressly stipulated in the Contract for the noted submittal by 14 calendar days.
Moreover, from a review of the subsequent revised Electrical Shop Drawings and Electrical Document
Submittals issued thereafter, we note that the trend for responding late continued.
We intend to provide you with an update to this Notice in due course, but meanwhile, we contend that
this ‘lateness’ constitutes an act of prevention and/or breach of Contract and accordingly give you
notice pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 of our right to claim:
(i)
An extension to the Time for Completion pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c); and
(ii)
An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.1 pursuant to Clause 9.10, or,
in the alternative, damages for breach of contract.
Interim and/or final details of the Time Impact and adjustments to the Contract Price relating to this
event will be provided in due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Clause 27.1.5(a), (b) and (c).
Yours faithfully,
