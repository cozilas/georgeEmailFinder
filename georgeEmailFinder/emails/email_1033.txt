Dear Sir,
Kindly find enclosed the Engineer’s letter referenced (1) above which is self-explanatory. Specifically, the
Engineer’s letter is regarding your failure to provide the documents required for your glass painting
works and Painters Evaluation by Alva Paints. For clarity and for the purpose of interpretation, “the
Contractor” in the Engineer’s letter shall be read as “the Subcontractor”.

In light of the above, you are instructed pursuant to Clause 11.3 [Instructions of the Contractor] to
immediately take appropriate action and submit all required documents and comply with the Engineer’s
request accordingly.
You are reminded that any delays, costs, losses and/or expenses incurred by us and/or Other
Subcontractor/s arising as a result of the above delays shall be at your risk and recovered from your
account in accordance with the Subcontract clauses 10.3[Contractor’s Claims], 16.6.1 [Delay Damages]
and other relevant clauses.
This is for your utmost attention and immediate action.
Yours faithfully,
