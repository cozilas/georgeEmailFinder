Rooms – Request for IFC Drawings and Engineer’s Instruction
Dear Sir
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and/or disruption to the Works and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
The matters described in Annex A concern delays associated with the Employer’s / Employer’s Design
Consultant’s insistence that we instigate change to the existing design to 10 nos. of Lift Machine Rooms
to Level L0.0, L1.0 and L2.0, in order to maintain specific operating and environmental conditions. This
represents a change to our scope of Works, and will require the provision of revised IFC Drawings and an
accompanying Engineer’s Instruction/Variation Order for us to integrate such change into the Works.
Potential Impact
Delays and disruption due to the events and circumstances outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
likely to impact on achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within seven (7) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
(1)
Site Memo 03261
On 7 April 2019, we received Site Memo (SM) No. MTC-CMA-0401-QC-MEM-03261 [dated 4 April 2019]
prepared by CMA, pertaining to the ‘LET – Air Conditions in the Lift Machine Room’ worded as follows:
‘During the WIR inspections, CMA noted that ELV-05-127 & 128 lift was functioning without proper
cooling system in the lift machine room. As per EN-81-1-1998 +A3 - Section 6.3, the air-condition
equipment is required to maintain the necessary cooling system. Same was recommended by the
manufacturer also. Present environment in the lift machine room does not comply with the EN-81-1
code requirements.
The temperature inside the machine room was bit high when compared to the outside area at the time
of the inspection.
Requirements:
Contractor to provide necessary cooling system as required to maintain the temperature.
Contractor to investigate at site and provide the details of the lift machine rooms / controller
rooms that require the air-conditioning system.
Contractor to check and necessary actions within 2 weeks from the receipt of this site memo.
This direction is for implementation.’
Attached to Site Memo 03261 were the following:
1.
Work Inspection Request (WIR) No: WIR-LET-0359-01

2.
Specification Section 142100 (‘Elevators’); and
3.
Material Submittal No: MS/0401/LET//0041 Rev. 2 (‘Traction Elevators’)
Initial response:
We responded to Site Memo 03261 on or about 16 June 2019, informing you to “Refer to attached RFI17088 request to close out the Site Memo.” [Details pertaining to RFI-17088 are described below].
You replied on or around 18 June 2019 and directed us to “provide the necessary ventilation as per RFI.
[i.e. as per Response to RFI/0401/17088] …. Acceptance of OTIS of the same. Kindly note that the heat
dissipation shall be more once system gets into operation. This is JV issue not OTIS.”
Secondary response
We issued a later response on 26 November 2019, in which we referred you to “attached response copy
and e-mails showing the accepted required temperature.”
You replied on or about 19 December 2019, stating: “Closed SM but is now referred to NCR.”

RFI-17088
Meanwhile, on 5 May 2019, we raised Request for Information (RFI) No: RFI/0401/17088 Rev. 00 (ref: 2)
seeking further clarification of the ‘Cooling Requirements for Lift Machine Rooms.’
‘With reference to the attached site memo ref. 3216 where the Engineer had raised concerns with
regards to the lack of a cooling system for the lift machine rooms of lift ELV-05-127 & 128, we note that
the mechanical IFC does not show any cooling equipment serving this room. The Contractor had further
investigated other lift machine rooms and found that the mechanical IFCs do not show cooling
equipment for the lift machine rooms listed in the attached table.’
Attached thereto was:
1.
A partial extract of IFC Drawing No: MTC-M-02-TB-L0.1-5.12-00.001 (Figure 1); and
2.
A schedule of ‘Lift Machine Rooms without Cooling System/Equipment’ (Figure 2).
Figure 1
Figure 2

We requested a response to RFI/0401/17088 Rev. 00 by 8 May 2019. However, you failed to reply until
12 June 2019. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that the Employer’s Design Consultant (KPF) stated:
“We do not agree with the statement in the CMA Site Memo that states "as per EN-81-1-1998 +A3Section 6.3, the air condition equipment is required to maintain the necessary cooling system". EN-811-1998 does not state air-conditioning is required for machine room. It only states in section 6.3.6 Ventilation, that the machine rooms shall be suitably ventilated. The control rooms must be maintained
within the operating range specified by the equipment manufacturer (roughly 1 0-40deg C) with
controlled humidity. Code does not require a specific method of how to achieve this. RFI indicates room
temperature was a "bit high" - which may mean the room was within the operating limits, there is no
requirement that the machine room be maintained within "comfortable standards".”
Clearly, the Employer’s Design Consultant (KPF) disagreed entirely with the comments detailed in Site
Memo 03261 and in short advised you that contrary to your assertion, no air-condition equipment is in
fact required within the noted lift machine rooms “to maintain the necessary cooling …” and similar
there is no requirement that the machine rooms are to be maintained within “comfortable standards.”
That said, the Employer’s Design Consultant (KPF) further advised of the following:
“Further, Elevators 05-98 and 05-99 are subject to RFI-9213. In this RFI response KPF "took no objection
to JV proposed Elevator Control room" locations and the JV was to include Mechanical Ventilation for
the control room.
As noted on MTC-A-07-TB-L_-_-_-_-00-289 this is a "Contractor Proposed Variation" and the Contractor
should provide the necessary cooling services for the elevators if necessary as per required temperature.

The remaining 6 elevator groups in the list (05-129, 05-127/128, 05-66/67 05-27/28/111, 37/38/112 and
05-76/77) are all provided with heat vent openings on the top of the shaft as outlined on MTC-A-07-TBL_-_-_-_-00-001 and the corresponding elevator section drawings. Heat from the lift machines are
rejected into the shaft and dissipate via the top of the shaft. We would take no exception to the
Contractor providing cooling to these machine rooms to accommodate the equipment selected by the
Elevator Manufacturer and new requirement for cooling at this stage. The Contractor is reminded of
their responsibility to verify that their proposed equipment selections, such as elevators, are
coordinated with the IFC design. CMA to clarify temperature in related machine rooms.’”
Your response to RFI/0401/17088 Rev. 00 on the other hand, advised us of the following:
“MEP heat loads were mentioned / provided in the A07 summary sheet. Heat release load/lift was
provided in OTIS GAD. Contractor should have co-ordinated & dealt accordingly on such requirements
at engineering stage itself. However, it is contractor responsibility to ensure their system functionality &
performance are complied with the MTB requirements & operations at their own accord ....”

TCA JV letter L/014925, dated 21 October 2019
For the reasons comprehensively recorded in our letter (ref: 3) we disagree entirely with both your and
the Employer’s Design Consultant’s response to RFI/0401/17088 Rev. 00. While we acknowledged that
the cooling requirements to Lift Machine Rooms to Elevators 05-98 and 05-99 (cited therein – subject to
RFI/0401/9213) would be addressed separately on the basis they are Service Elevators and are subject
to a Contractor Proposed Variation, we reminded you of the obligations under the Contract of both
ourselves and the Employer in relation to the cooling requirements to the remaining Passenger Lifts.
Specification Section 142100 (‘Elevators’) requires us to provide equipment suitable for operating in an
environmental temperature range of between 5 and 40°C. Furthermore, our obligation to provide
cooling is limited to providing under cab units in locations indicated on the IFC Design Documents.
Further, due to fire regulations we are obliged to smoke seal the Lift Machine Rooms from the shafts.
Therefore, heat cannot be “rejected” into the lift shafts as stated by the Employer's Design Consultant.
Therefore, we rightfully objected to the insinuation that we are somehow responsible for the resolution
of this issue and advised that we have provided both you and the Employer's Design Consultant with the
relevant technical documentation to ensure you are both fully aware of any impact the lift machinery
may have on the immediate environment. It is the Employer's Design Consultant’s obligation to ensure
its design is adequate to provide appropriate environmental conditions to the noted lift machine rooms;
and while we recognise that it is the Employer’s responsibility to provide us with an adequate HVAC
design, we have simply brought the design deficiency to your attention in order to resolve the matter.
We concluded our letter ref: (3) by asking that you provide us the necessary IFC Design Information and
an Engineer's Instruction to enable us to provide a proposal associated with ‘providing cooling to these
machine rooms to accommodate the equipment … and new requirement for cooling; but in the
meantime, informed you that you would be held accountable for any delays associated with your / the
Employer’s / Employer’s Design Consultant’s failure to provide us with an adequate mechanical design.

CMA letter LTR-11195, dated 20 January 2020
However, in your response dated 20 January 2020 (ref: 4) you advised us that it was our responsibility to
provide the necessary ventilation to all the Machine Rooms as per the attached rooms list [pursuant to
Specification Section 142100 Item 1.16 C, item 2.5 AS G, and BS EN 81 Clause 6.3.6], and maintained that
“in order to gain the required environmental temperature range depending on the heat dissipation from
the equipment selected, the Elevator Manufacturer should provide the expected heat dissipation and
[we] the Contractor should estimate the cooling load required for the listed rooms accordingly.”
Accordingly, you objected to our request for an Engineer's Instruction and advised us that any delays
resulting from our purported “reluctance” to proceed with the works will remain our responsibility, and
insisted upon us providing a proposal for the required ventilation in these rooms “at the earliest.”

For the reasons previously described in our letter ref: (3), we reject your position and maintain that any
requirement for us to provide any additional equipment and / provide cooling to the machine rooms to
accommodate the “a new requirement for cooling” is additional to the design and our scope of Works.
(5)
NCR-01527
Meanwhile however, on 18 January 2020, we received Non-Conformance Report (NCR) No: MTC-CMA0401-CM-NCR-01517 [dated 7 January 2020] (ref: 5), advising us of a purported non-conformance of the
‘Ventilation and Cooling in the Lift Machine and Controller Rooms’ in the manner shown in Figure 3.
Figure 3
The accompanying schedule (Annex A) provides details of 10 Lift Machine and Controller affected by this
issue (an extract of which is reproduced in Figure 4 below). [Note: Figure 3 states there are 17 rooms
affected. This is incorrect. The ‘No. of Units’ is shown to total 17, but there are only 10 rooms listed]:
Figure 4
In summary, a combination of the information detailed Site Memo 03261, RFI/0401/17088 Rev. 00 and
NCR-01517 shows that the Machine Rooms subject to Figure 4 above, are to be “suitably ventilated” to
ensure compliance with the requirements of EN81-1:1998 + A3:2009 and 6.3.6 EN81.1; and that the
operating and environmental conditions for the same are to be maintained between 5 and 40°C.
As noted in our letter dated 21 October 2019 (ref: 3), the technical accuracy of the Site Memo raised by
you, is your own internal matter to resolve with the Employer’s Design Consultant; we have constructed
the Lift Machine Rooms in accordance with the Employer’s / Employer’s Design Consultant’s IFC Design
Drawings. If you and / or the Employer’s Design Consultant are desirous of implementing changes to the
Lift Machine Rooms to ensure certain operating and environmental conditions are to be achieved, then
the requirements of SAA8 are clear; you must instruct us. If you require changes that are out of the
current design, which the comments annotated on Site Memo 03261, RFI/0401/17088 Rev. 00 and NCR01517 reflect, then you must provide us with properly coordinated and fully detailed revised IFC
Drawings reflecting that change in requirements under an Engineer’s Instruction / Variation Order.
Meanwhile, until such time as you provide us with revised IFC Drawings indicating the change in design,
we will continue to proceed in accordance with the existing IFC design to the extent we are able to.
Yours faithfully,
