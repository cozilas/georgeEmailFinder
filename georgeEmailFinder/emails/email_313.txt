Subject: SAA8: supplementary agreement
Dear Sirs,
We refer to your letter cited above and reiterate that the basis upon which SAA8 was executed was
the understanding reached between senior members of the Parties, that a supplementary agreement
would be issued within weeks of 20 September 2018, the date of its execution. Clause 5 of SAA8
would thereby be superseded and provision would be made to pay the agreed sum in respect of
variations that had been instructed after SAA8 negotiations had commenced.
The purpose of our latest letter noted above was to record that the facts in respect of subsidence
gathered over the intervening eleven months had strengthened the position of the JV, further
supporting that understanding: two expert reports had confirmed that the cause of the subsidence
was not materials or workmanship.
We trust that you will now review our letter of 29 August 2019 in this context let us have your
comments on our proposed draft of the supplementary agreement.
Yours faithfully,
