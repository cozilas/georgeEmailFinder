Dear Sir,

This is an instruction under Sub-Clause 13.1.1 to initiate a variation. The nature and extent of the
variation is outlined below.
Volume 7, Sub-Clause 13.3.3.15 c)

Sub-Clause 13.3.3.15 c) is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:
Sub-Clause 13.3.3.15 Repair of Segments.

c)
Categories of segment defects are defined as minor, medium and major, as shown in the table
below:

"Minor"

"Medium"

"Major"

Broken edge < 5mm Air holes < Bmm
Crack width < 0.15mm Crack depth < 20mm No need for repair Broken edge 5mm to 25mm Air holes
Bmm to 14mm
Crack width 0.15mm to 0.20mm Crack depth < 20mm

Surface depression < 20mm Can be repaired
0.20mm Crack depth > 20mm

Broken edge > 25mm Air holes > 14mm Crack width >

Surface depression > 20mm Will be rejected
i-

Minor defects can be accepted without repair.

iiMedium defects can be repaired only after the detailed method statement has been given a
SONO from the Engineer. This does not release the Contractor from his obligations to satisfy the
Employer's Requirements, including but not limited to Volume 7, Clause 12.3.1.1 Precast concrete
segmental linings shall be of waterproofing class 1.
iiiWhere a major defect occurs prior to the final placement of the relevant segment in the tunnel
it will be rejected.
iv-

All Segment defects that are in contact with the gasket must be repaired.

Contractor is required to provide a detailed written cost assessment of any potential impact as
subsequence of this Engineer's Instruction.
Yours faithfully,
