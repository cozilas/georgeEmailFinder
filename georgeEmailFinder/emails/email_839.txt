Subject Reply letter – Notification of Delay to Subcontract Works due to the recently introduced Access
Restrictions
Dear Sir,
We acknowledge receipt of your letter referenced in (3) above regarding the aforementioned subject,

We reject your assertion that the recently introduced access restrictions are severely hampering your
progress of works. Please be advised that you were properly notified about the closure of the south
ramp at the east of the building in a timely manner as evidenced by our enclosed email sent to you on
19th April 2018 referenced in (4) above. Such notification was to enable you to plan your work and put
in place necessary precautions to avoid any access problem.
In this regard, you were given ample time to respond accordingly highlighting your concerns to our
Construction/Logistics team hence as per our record, we received none of such response or comments
from any of your site team.
Additionally, you are hereby reminded to be conversant with the Subcontract Clause 10.1.3 which
provides that:
•
Right of access will be subject to such constraints and subject to compliance with such
arrangements and stipulations as the Contractor may from time to time advise in writing. The
Subcontractor acknowledges that such constraints may include, but are not limited to, constraints as to
the areas of the Site to be made available to the Subcontractor from time to time, and the rights of the
Contractor and Other Subcontractors to concurrently perform works on the Site and to move across and
through the Site. The Subcontractor shall not be entitled to make any claim for additional Cost incurred
as a result of such constraints and compliance with such stipulations and shall not be entitled to make
any claim for extension to the Subcontract Time for Completion where such constraints and compliance
cause delay to the Subcontractor's performance of the Subcontract Works.
In view of the above, we reject your assertion to claim for Extension of Subcontract Time for Completion
with additional cost.

Yours faithfully,
