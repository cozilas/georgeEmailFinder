resubmission of Structural Calculations, Fabrication and Installation of the aforesaid works.
We further record that, as of to date, the Structural Calculations remained with Code 3 status thus a
period of exceeding two {2) years as indicated in the below table.
This adversely affects the progress of procurement, fabrication and installation of site works as
evidenced by lack of corrective action from your side in revising and resubmitting the structural
calculations for approval.
Additionally, we also record that your progress at site is very slow due to the continuous presence of
inadequate manpower, which in turn delay overall completion of these works. Consequently, you are
hereby held responsible for all the delays caused to date by your continuous failure to rectify and submit
compliant structural calculations in order to proceed with the site works.
You are hereby reminded of your obligations as set out under the Subcontract which include,
