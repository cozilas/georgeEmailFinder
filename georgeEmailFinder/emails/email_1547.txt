Dear Sirs,

Further to the Contractor's initial interim Claim Nr 039 submission issued under cover of reference 3, the
Contractor confirms within this February 2016 monthly update (in accordance with General Condition
("GC") 20.1.6(b) of Volume 3 of the Contract), that, to date, no additional information has been received
by the Contractor over the past month concerning the subject matter of Claim Nr 039.

However, as the event giving rise to this Claim has a continuing effect and the Contractor is still collating
further particulars, the Contractor shall be submitting further interim Claim submissions with respect to
the Claim Event giving rise to Claim Nr 039 at monthly intervals as required by GC 20 .1.6(b).

Yours faithfully,
