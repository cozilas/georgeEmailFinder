Dear sir

The Engineer's Assistant refers to the Contractor's correspondence at (1) above and wishes to note the
following points:

Non-compliance with ABM arises from the Contractor's design proposals which include an MEP shaft in
place of a void to the rear of the lift shafts to accommodate smoke extract and air intake ducts. This
particular has been discussed at length in many architectural design workshops and MEP design
meetings. The Contractor is quite correct in asserting that there is a provision within the ABM to
facilitate MEP!Technical rooms within the entrance shelter, however, this does not refer to the space at
the rear of the lift space which is clearly indicated as being an open void al all times.

The Engineer's Assistant would also note that during the design development workshops it was apparent
that the AHU rooms for the provision of air-conditioning to the entrance shelters if placed behind the
lifts and escalators at ground level presented a difficulty in routing ductwork and that locating these
rooms beneath the entrance presented a far better option. Furthermore, the Engineer's Assistant would
refer the Contractor to ABM Generic I Type station layout (Ref: D1-GUl-1-181.dwg) which clearly

illustrates the preferred option of MEP rooms located behind the lifts and escalators at concourse l evel.
It is still the Engineer's Assistant assertion that the inclusion of MEP shafts behind and directly
connected to the lift shafts is non-compliant with ABM intent

The Contractor's comments regarding DD1 are noted, however, the Engineer's Assistant wishes to bring
to the Contractor's attention that the issue of the MEP rooms at grade was highlighted in the Engineer's
Assistant's comments in the Document Review Sheets issued with our review of the DD1 and
furthermore it was noted that there was a requirement to liaise with the FoH designers to ensure
compliance with ABM.

Finally, te Contractor's comment regarding the design progressing with MEP in the ground level does not
refleCf the situation at present where design is clearly progressing on the basis of MEP wherever
possible t the concourse level.
Yours faithfully,
