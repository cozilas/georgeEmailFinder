Subject MTB Delay Notification -Subsidence Works
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence (1) and record the Contractor's delays in achieving
Substantial Completion of the Works. We note in particular the delays attributed to the Subsidence
Works which in accordance with Clause 5.3.2 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8
should have been completed but still remain outstanding. To date, the Contractor has not yet started
the works of Pier 1 and the remaining part of Pier 2.
The drilling works of Pier 1 should have started on 01 December 2019 according to the Contractor's
Monthly Updated Programme with the data dated 01 November 2019 (2). Unfortunately, the works
did not commence as targeted and as a result the Pier 1 completion date is forecasted to be 01
October 2020, assuming that the works would start by mid to late December 2019.
The completion date of Pier 1 would therefore be further delayed beyond the Contractor's target
completion date of 15 September 2020.
Notwithstanding the above, the Contractor's Updated Programmes (2 and 3) indicated different
durations as summarized in the table below (attachments 1 and 2) where the Contractor appears to
have reduced the duration requ ired for Pier 1 in these monthly updates as to suppress the delays
resulting from not commencing the works as initially planned.

The Contractor is therefore required to address the above and provide its action plan to mitigate t hese

delays .
Yours faithfully,
