Inconsistent Tilt Graphic Data

Dear Sir,
The Engineer refers to the Tilt Graphic information that has been prepared following the ongoing CCTV
surveys conducted through the sewer network infrastructure over the past 11 months.
We refer you to the attached document which compares the tilt graphic information on three (3)
sections of pipeline. Two of the sections show different profiles and invert levels over an intervening
period of approximately seven (7) months and one section of pipeline S2307-S2307A appears to have
a tilt graphic profile identical to that of pipeline S1217 - S1218 with a difference of approximately 3m
in the invert levels.
Given the significant inconsistencies and apparent duplication of longitudinal profile information on
different sections of the sewer main, we have very little credibility in the accuracy of this survey
information produced by your survey company, KMG. This is of great concern to the Engineer as this
information is being used as the basis of the ongoing investigation and design of the rectification
solution by the Employer's Design Consultant.
We therefore request the Contractor to advise what course of action they will be undertaking to
accurately assess the pipeline profiles and integrity of the same. We would expect as a minimum that
the Contractor engages the services of another reputable professional CCTV survey specialist to
conduct such works to verify the accuracy of what has been CCTV surveyed previously and for the
balance sections of pipeline to be surveyed.
Furthermore, we request that the Contractor expedites the excavation of the seven (7) sections of
pipeline as detailed in correspondence for verification purposes.
Your immediate response is requested.
Yours faithfully,
