Subject:SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26, E-Notice No. – E0003 – GH 20 Dismantling of the buried cable duct
Dear Sir,
The Contractor writes in reference to the delays incurred as per our Subcontractor’s letter M/S Guinault
Lebrun (GL) referenced (1) above and enclosed herewith, which is self-explanatory. We hereby notify
you pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 that this event
may cause delay to the Works and therefore we seek your swift resolution to avoid any future
disruption or delay pertaining to this matter.
Specifically, the delays are due to the buried cable duct which is used for the provision of pull and lay
cables and is currently being dismantled by the Employer’s Subcontractor M/S L&T for carrying out
ground leveling and excavation works. As a result, the dismantling activities of the buried cable duct are
hindering the mentioned works for the electrical installations, of our Subcontractor M/S GL.
Your further guidance, decision and/or instruction is required by no later than 12 November 2018 at the
very latest; failing which the Works are likely to be delayed and/or disrupted.

We reserve our rights under the Contract pursuant to Sub-Clause 27.1 (Contractor’s Claims) to an
extension to the Time for Completion and additional Costs arising from the above described event.
Yours faithfully,
