Subject CP rMainiRodfcGypsum BOa l!dc R~pl~t:ement 11
Dear Sir,
The Contractor acknowledges receipt of the above referenced Engineer's letter (1) and shall be succinct
and unequivocal in its response hereafter.
The Engineer has not provided conclusive proof of defective gypsum boards i.e. substantiated by means
of
expert opinion or third party testing. The Engineer's hypothesis is conjectural based upon the opinion of
persons not sufficiently experienced or knowledgeable to review the roof discipline Contrary to the
Engineer's failure of proof, the Contractor has conclusively proofed via third party testing,
that the alleged defective gypsum boards exceed the project performance specification requirements.
The Engineers reference to Contractor's letter (21) is erroneous, since the Contractor has replaced
gypsum
board it undertook to replace in accordance with the requirement of NCR 798 but the Engineer refused
to
select the same for inspection/verification.
Finally and for the avoidance of doubt, the Contractor shall continue to refute the Engineer's rejection of
the Works under Clause 15.4.1 Conditions of Contract and requires the Engineer to provide
unambiguous
reasons for rejection as required pursuant to aforesa id Contract Clause.
Yours faithfully
