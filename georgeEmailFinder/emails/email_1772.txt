Dear Sir,

The Contractor notes that the entirety of the Scope of Work contemplated by the Contract with regards
the MEP Provisional Sums has now been instructed (Design, Construction, VHTS, BACS). The total value
of the awarded work being lower than that of the Provisional Sum, there remains a balance of
Overheads, Management and Attendance (OMA) that has not been instructed pro-rata.

The Contractor reminds the Engineer’s Assistant of the following extract from Contract Document
Volume 2 – Form of Proposal, Part 2 – Commercial Proposal, Clause 9.1 – Pricing Document, Subclause
9.1.2.9 (m) (i):

“The Contractor will receive full value of the lump sums entered [for OMA] regardless of any increase or
decrease of the Provisional Sum.”

The Contractor would like to address the method for receiving these OMA payments with the Engineer’s
Assistant as soon as possible as a way of improving the Contractor’s Cashflow. The Contractor also
wishes to address a similar situation on the Provisional Sum for Utility Diversions which will be occurring
very soon.

Yours faithfully,
