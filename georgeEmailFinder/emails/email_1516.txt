Notice of Delay - 5 Key Design Issues and Station Area Planning (SAP)

In accordance with clause 4.6.la) of our Sub Design Contract, we are submitt ing a notice that the
Services are being delayed by the Client that will increase the scope, costs and duration of our Services.

In the ALYSJ JV Weekly Engineering meeting on the 22"d June 2015 it was advised that the Design
Programme is to be rescheduled to inco rporate the 5 key design issues raised by Qatar Rail. We have
not received formally an updated schedule to assess the impact of this change to our Services.

It has also been brought to our attention within the PMC Weekly Engineering on the 301 June 2015 that
the Station Area Planning Baseline drawings are to be incorporated into current designs. We have not
received formally an updated schedule to assess the impact of this change to our Services.

Once we have received the updated schedules from ALYSJ JV we will advise of the increase of
scope,costs and duration to our current services.
Yours faithfully,
