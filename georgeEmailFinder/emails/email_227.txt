Subject: Cavity Detection Near GH-19
Dear Sir,
We write to you to confirm the oral instruction received from your site representative, in relation
with the drilling fluid (slurry) loss and cavity detected near Gatehouse 19, at grouting point SEW1102C-016.
As indicated in our email addressed to you on 17/12/2019 at 15:26 (Attachment - 1), during the
drilling activity at grouting point SEW-1102C-016, the drilling rod has experienced a "free-fall"
between 4m and 12m relative depth from the existing ground level. At 12m depth, an impenetrable
hard layer has been experienced. We have immediately requested a meeting on Site for further
investigation of the situation. Despite our notification and calls, there has been no attendance from
the Engineer.
Today, on planned site walk, your site representative indicated that "whatever experienced is not
actually a free fall" but "poo~ backfill" done by the,"APM Head House Con~ractor- CCC". He further
explained that there is no "water loss" and the relevant contractor (CCC) will be excavating the area
and replacing the backfill material. Upon our instigation for an advise, whether to pull the drilling
rod and move on to next area, we have been told to stop and leave as is. We hereby confirm that
oral instruction, in line with Clause 11.3.1 of our Contract, which shall constitute a "written
instruction once approved in writing by the Engineer".
As always we await your advice and guidance in the matter and remain .
Yours faithfully
