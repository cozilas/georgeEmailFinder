Delay Notice & Notice to Correct at CP & Pier 2

Dear Sir,
We refer to the above subject and the enclosed email correspondence to put on record your persistent
failure in the completion of the works in a timely manner, which has been notified to you numerous
times. We also put on record once again your lack of materials which is affecting the works, delaying
other activities, overall having a direct impact on the completion in all areas and has to be resolved
immediately.
In light of the above, be informed that the following works need your urgent attention:
•
Deliveries of cladding, glass, and aluminium have virtually stopped in Pier 2;
•
There is no progress with portal, cladding, glass and aluminium deliveries for CP Gatehouses;
•
Your continued failure to deliver as per the delivery schedules submitted by Assa Abloy is
putting the project milestones at risk and is completely unacceptable;

•
All shop drawings are severely late. It was agreed that Prometal/Assa Abloy would proceed with
fabrication based on corrected drawings at the time of submission. Lately, we have found that some of
your submitted drawings were never corrected and are still deficient;
•
Provide your recovery plan for submission of all drawings in order to fabricate and meet the
milestones;
•
Provide guard doors as per your scope of work.
In view of the above, you are hereby instructed to take immediate action at no additional cost to us, in
order to complete the aforementioned area(s) and submit a recovery plan with your planned
completion date with mitigation measures, including the dates that all materials will be available on site,
to recover the delays caused by you.
Consequently, due to the urgency of the works, in the event that you fail to take appropriate action
within 48 hours of receipt of this letter, we will have no other option than to proceed with taking all
necessary measures by deploying all required resources to complete the works on your behalf, which
you will be backcharged accordingly.
To conclude, any delays, costs, claims, losses and/or expenses and the like incurred by us and/or Other
Sub-Contractors arising as a result of your failure to complete the aforementioned activities will be
solely your responsibility as per the Subcontract Agreement Clauses including but not limited to 12.12.4
[Other Contractors and Other Subcontractors] and 16.6 [Delay Damages].
This is for your information and necessary urgent action.
Yours faithfully,
