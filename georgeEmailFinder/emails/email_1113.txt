Subject: Subcontractor's Obligations under Clause 12.5.3 of the Conditions of Subcontract Maintenance
of Performance Security

Dear Sir,
The Contractor refers the Subcontractor to Interim Payment Certificate No. 51 which records the value
of the
Subcontract Works carried out up to the end of November 2017.
The Contractor records that, up to the end of November 2017, Variation Orders and contra charges had
been
issued to the Subcontractor in amounts of AED 72,304,567.82 and AED (12,529,289.28) respectively. The
issuance of these Variation Orders and contra charges has resulted in an adjustment to the Subcontract
Price
equal to AED 59,775,278.54. In other words, the Subcontract Price has been increased by an amount
greater
than the percentage specified in Schedule 1 [Subcontract Particulars] which is ten percent (10%).
Pursuant to the provisions of Clause 12.5.3 of the Conditions of Subcontract, the Contractor directs the
Subcontractor to provide an additional security so that the increased amount of security is the
percentage of
the increased Subcontract Price within fourteen (14) days of receipt of this direction.
Yours faithfully,
