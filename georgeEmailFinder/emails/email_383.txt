Subject: Contractor’s Claims Notices
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence (1) regarding the Contractor's claims notices and we
comment as follows:
Despite the Contractor's assertion that they are "sufficiently aware of what the Contract says
regarding the preparation and submission of Contractor's claims" we note that to date the Contractor
has continuously disregarded the contractual requirements and have failed to adhere to their
obligations.
The Engineer has provided a no objection to the Contractor's Time Impact Analysis methodology in
principle and based upon the comments provided in correspondence (4) be addressed by the
Contractor. Specifically the Engineer's comments were:
• This methodology may change for specific delay events.
• A separate TIA is required for each delay event and a consolidated TIA for the combined effect
of delays
• Contractor to demonstrate that there was no Contractor concurrent delay
• A mitigation plan is required as part of the TIA
• No project data on Baseline is to be changed without approval from the Engineer
The Contractor is well aware that consolidated TIAs are unacceptable as this has been communicated
over the years. To this effect and for clarity purposes the Contractor is referred to the following
correspondence:
In light of the above the Engineer reiterates that non-compliance with the contractual requirements,
prevents the Engineer from assessing the impact of the alleged delays.
Yours faithfully,
