Subject: Delay in HVAC Ducts Cleaning Works
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to your letter (1) in which you advise us of purported delays to HVAC ducts
cleaning work.
We refer you to your letter (2), of the same title, to which we responded in detail via our letter (3)
and confirm that our responses in that letter to your concerns remain unchanged and are applicable
in response to your letter (1).
Currently, any cleaning works remaining to the HVAC ducts is not causing delay or disruption to any
of the Employer's Contractors, neither is the Employer suffering any financial loss.
We conclude by reiterating that we remain fully committed to the Employer, the Project and to
completing our obligations within the shortest possible time, without compromising on safety and
quality, but will not be held responsible for such factors as those outlined above for which we are not
culpable.
Yours faithfully,
