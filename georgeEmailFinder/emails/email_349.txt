to Level L0.1 – Engineer’s Response to RFI/0401/17164 – Request for IFC Drawings plus Engineer’s
Instruction and Variation Order
Dear Sir
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and/or disruption to the Works and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
The matters described in Annex A concern delays associated with the provision of additional power
supplies to eight Hold Open Doors to Level L0.1 introduced through the response to RFI/0401/17164.
Potential Impact
Delays and disruption due to the events and circumstances outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
likely to impact on achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within seven (7) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
As you are only too aware, during the early part of this year, a series of workshops were held in order to
resolve various discrepancies in design documents issued by you relating to doors, door hardware and
associated systems. However, it was during these workshops, when discussing the Employer’s
Requirements that we were informed that the technical information/requirements to 152 out of 383
nos. of doors had changed compared to previously issued information; our letter ref (3) refers. This
records that on 1 April 2019, we raised RFI/0401/17005 as a means to resolve remaining door issues,
attached to which was a schedule of the 152 doors whose details had changed. We requested that you
provide: (1) confirmation of the information reflected in the attached door schedule [reflecting the
agreed changes, including without limitation, a request for the access control types and related
information]; and (2), an updated door schedule and IFC Drawings in confirmation of the same.
Despite us requesting that you reply to RFI/0401/17005 by 9 April 2019, you failed to respond until 30
calendar days later i.e. on 9 May 2019 (see Table 1 below). Furthermore, not only did you fail to provide
the updated Door Schedule and IFC Drawings information as requested, but some of the information /
requirements to the 152 doors subject to RFI/0401/17005 had in fact been changed.

Your response to RFI/0401/17005 reads as follows:
“The 152 doors will have an updated door clear dimension, FA requirement, SACS type, hardware set
and other details of the doors as per the workshop notes based on coordination of door functionality.
Note that the same information has been confirmed on DS-14204 submitted by TCA-JV. Refer to the
attached mark-up for additional notes. - Design coordination/Technical clarification [sic].”
As noted by you, we had in the meantime, submitted Document Submittal No: DS/0401/14204 Rev. 00
[on 24 March 2019] enclosing the same information relating to the ‘outstanding doors pending for
confirmation by the Engineer (152 doors)’ that was attached to RFI/0401/17005, which you returned
classified as Status Code 2 ‘Exceptions as noted’ together with comments on 25 April 2019.
However, we have since found that 8 doors shown on the schedule of ‘outstanding doors pending
confirmation by the Engineer’, required further clarification due to the fact that on the one hand the
hardware sets were confirmed as being referenced ‘445-2’ (i.e. with Electric Hold Open Device) [which
means power is required], yet on the other hand, the requirement for a commensurate Security Access
Control System (SACS) and ‘Power Assist’ to each door was shown to be ‘N/A’ [not applicable], in other
words, not required. That said, in the event that hardware set ‘445-2’ is required for these 8 doors then
they will require a power supply for them to function and operate. However, a review of the
corresponding Electrical IFC Layouts shows no incoming power supply to the doors.
It is because of this anomaly, that we have been compelled to raise RFI/0401/17164 on 29 May 2019
(refer to Figure 2 below), requesting your assistance with providing further clarification as to the
‘missing power supply for [the] Hold Open Devices’ for these eight (8) nos. of doors.

Once again despite us requesting a response by a specific date (6 June 2019), you failed to reply until 20
calendar days later, on 26 June 2019. Moreover, we note that the ‘Power Assist’ requirements to the 8
nos of doors subject to this RFI had changed from ‘Not Required’ to ‘Required’ (Table 3 refers).

We further record that attached to your response to RFI/0401/17164 were two (2) sketches,
enumerated as ‘ESK-2719 RFI-0401-17164’ and ESK-2720 RFI-0401-17164’, prepared by the Employer’s
Design Consultant showing the specific provision of [the additional] power supplies for [the] Hold Open
doors’ [to sections 5.16 and 5.21 to L0.1]; extracts of which are provided in Figure 1.
Figure 1

Section 5.16 to Level L0.1
Part Plan of MTC-E-09-TB-L0.1—5.16-001
Section 5.21 to Level L0.1
Part Plan of MTC-E-09-TB-L0.1—5.21-001
It is patently clear that the information reflected in the two sketches attached to your response to
RFI/0401/17164 represents a change to the existing design and a change to our scope of works.
In order for us to undertake and instigate changes such as those noted above, we will require fully
coordinated revised IFC Drawings encapsulating the changes introduced in your RFI response, and
further remind you that SAA8 laid down mandatory procedures to be followed if additional works are
required, in so far as an EI and VO are needed for us to proceed with the aforementioned changes.
The provisions of Clauses 2.29 to 2.31 of SAA8’ pertaining to Variations are clear; we are not to proceed
with any Variation unless a Variation Order and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. In which
respect, it is your obligation to issue this Record first if you wish to instigate change; this is only after the
additional time and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.
Therefore, until such time as you take the action required of you in accordance with SAA8 Clause 2.29,
we are unable to proceed with implementing the changes noted above and will continue to proceed in
accordance with the existing IFC design to the extent we are able to. We trust this is clear.
We once again take this opportunity in reminding you that the responsibility under the Contract for the
design of doors and the integration of those parts of the Works which are intrinsically linked to the
doors, including hardware, security access control system, power supply and the like, lies with the
Employer. Our responsibility is to follow with due diligence the Drawings and Specifications, and it is our
position that we have discharged, and continue to discharge, this obligation with the necessary
expertise, care and skill that could reasonably be expected from an experienced contractor.
Potential Impact:
We note that the foregoing events and/or circumstances may delay completion of Sections 5.16 and
5.21 to Level L0.1, and your / Employer’s Design Consultant’s requirement to introduce fundamental
changes to the electrical installations such as those outlined above, particularly at such a late stage of
the Project, will invariably impact on our ability to obtain the Building Completion certificate (BCC)
This is essential to achieving Milestone MS09B and may impact MS09C (Substantial Completion).
Yours faithfully,
