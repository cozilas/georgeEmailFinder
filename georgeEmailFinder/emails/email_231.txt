Subject Contractor's Confirmation of PPE-Free Access to the MTB
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence (1) wherein the Contractor advised that all internal areas
of the MTB will designated as PPE-Free from 31 December 2019.
The Contractor stated that it will not be necessary for non-TCAJV personnel to wear Personal
Protective Equipment (PPE). We note that the Contractor has not supported this statement with any
details or reference to any risk based analysis, assessment and /or clarity as to the Contractor's
comprehensive mitigation plans to accommodate the suggested changes.
Furthermore, the Contractor is required to confirm that they have conducted a full review of all their
plans, procedures, safe systems of work, as well as specific method statements and risk assessments
for all the Contractor's activities. The Contractor is requested to provide clarity on the review of these
and advise formally on any updates and amendments.

We bring to the Contractor's attention the incident which took place on 26 December 2019 where a
previously installed lighting unit fell approximately 40 meters into the CP area of the MTB and request
that the Contractor advise on how such incidents will be addressed and mitigated.
It is also noted that the Contractor refers to internal areas only as being PPE-Free and this was clarified
in the Risk Meeting that was held on 29 December 2019 as being for the Front of House areas. The
Engineer requests details as to what arrangements have been put in place for the safe access into and
from the MTB from external areas supported with a layout detailing the extents of these internal areas
that shall be PPE free.
The Contractor's detailed feedback is required prior to t he 31 December 2019.
Yours faithfully
