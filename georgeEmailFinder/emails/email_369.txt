Subject:Post SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0116
Delays to Glazing and 3rd Fix installation due to activities of the Employer’s Other Contractor’s Works
(DEPA - Lifting Frame for Material Shifting)
Dear Sirs,
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
For the reasons described in Annex A, our Works to the North Corridor between Levels L3.0 and L3.1
have been ‘on-hold’ since 6 April 2019 due to the activities of an Employer’s Other Contractor (DEPA).
Potential Impact:
Acts of prevention such as these will at this stage of the Works, prevent us from obtaining the Building
Completion Certificate (BCC). This is critical in us achieving completion of Milestone MS09B.
Consequently, the more we are prevented from working due to the combined effects of the above, the
more likely this will prevent us from achieving Substantial Completion (i.e. Milestone MS09C).
Action Required:
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are resolved within ten (10) days from the date of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.

ANNEX A
Description of the Event
On 6 April 2019 [5:58pm] we wrote albeit via e-mail, informing you that we were intending on closing
the opening within the partition wall to the North Corridor at Level L3.1, but had received advance
notification that a gantry was required to be installed by the Employer’s Other Contractor (DEPA) for the
purpose of shifting materials from Level L3.0 to L3.1 (the following photograph attached to our e-mail
reproduced at Figure 1 below refers). We advised you that if the opening was to be maintained, then
this would warrant an instruction formally instructing us to place our affected works ‘on hold’ and
requested the same from you; otherwise we would proceed as planned and close the opening.
Figure 1
On 7 April 2019 [12:25pm] we issued a further e-mail responding to your email of the same date [7 April
2019 11:34am], informing you that we were ready to proceed with all works associated with the closure
of the opening but it had been “requested by yourself … to hold our installation couple of days since you
intend to notify us officially to hold this opening”. However, no official response from you was issued
and since 7 April 2019 we have been prevented from completion of our Works.
We have since e-mailed you again on 3 July 2019 [1:48pm] notifying you that our Works (28 nos. of
Glass Wall Lining, 5 nos. Valance Glass, 5 nos. Light Box, 5 nos. Equipment Band, EPDM, and other civil
works) continue to remain ‘on hold’ [since 6 April 2019] due to the presence of DEPA’s gantry – the
following photograph and marked up drawing attached to our e-mail shown in Figure 2 refers.
Figure 2
Within our e-mail [of 3 July 2019] we also requested that you advise us “when DEPA will remove their
lifting frame for material shifting so we can complete glazing and 3rd fix installation”?
However, at the date of writing [25 July 2019] the situation remains unchanged, and our Works to the
North Corridor at Level L3.1 remain ‘on-hold’ (the following photograph at Figure 3 below refers).

Resultant Impact:
It is therefore clear that our ability to complete our Works to the area indicated are being delayed by
acts of prevention on the part of the Employer and / or the Employer’s Other Contractor. If matters
continue, then this will invariably knock on and impact upon our ability to achieve Milestone MS09B;
and similarly, may prevent us from achieving Substantial Completion (i.e. Milestone MS09C).
Yours faithfully,
