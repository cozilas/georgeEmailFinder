Dear Sir,

This is a direction under Sub-Clause 13.2.1 for the Contractor to submit a quotation both to timing and
price for the Variation proposed by the Engineer regarding work under the contract.

The Variation as proposed:

The Employers Requirements Volume 6, Sub-Clause 11.4.6.25 b) currently state that:

"Based on these calculations, the minimum clear width of such passageways, whether elevated or
underground, shall be no less than 1O m. This does not include areas of low mobility near to vertical
surfaces such as walls, railings or balustrades. For these areas, an additional width of 0.25 m must be
deducted per surface from the overall width to arrive at the absolute clear width for the passageway."

Volume 6, Sub-Clause 11.4.6.25 b) proposed:
To reflect an optimization outcome where the minimum clear width of passageways whether elevated
or underground is reduced to 6.80 meters (excluding event stations).

The potential minimum width allowable at each station is as shown in Attachment A, Summary Table of
Required Passageway Widths (attached). Contractor is to note that:
•

This does not include for finishes which should be assumed as +1.0m

•

Width of passageway is the clear width between the two (2) clad facades of the passageway

•
Width of walkway is the usable width of the walkway between the two (2) travellators or the
travellators and the wall - depending upon layout.

Stations where the minimum width has already been agreed with Other parties or where design and
construction may have advanced to the stage where reverting minimum width is no longer feasible,
shall be considered on a case by case basis.

The Contractor shall submit the quotation within 14 days from receipt of this direction.
Yours faithfully,
