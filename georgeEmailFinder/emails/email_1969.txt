Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer’s direction of letter reference 1) issued pursuant to General Condition (“GC”)
13.2.1 of Volume 3 of the Contract, the Contractor encloses herewith full particulars in relation to
Architectural Layout Improvements and MEP Data Provisions for Retail Spaces pursuant to its GC 13.2.2
obligations.

The Contractor has assessed the impacts of this proposed variation. The additional scope of Direction
reference 1) is currently under technical clarification and no design for these changes is currently
available.

The Contractor has therefore included an allowance for risk in his assessment. The Contractor has

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.
