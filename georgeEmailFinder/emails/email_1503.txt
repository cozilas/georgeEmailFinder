Dear Sir,

Further to the Notice of claim for Claim 034 at reference 1 above, the Contractor respectfully requests
the Engineers written agreement to an extension of 1 month to the current contractual submission date
for the claim of 29 October 2015.

The reason for this extension request is to enable the initial claim 034 submission to be quantified in this
time. The SAP drawings have resulted in changes to each and every station which will take some time to
identify the full impact. The granting of this extension will also give us time to respond to the request for
further clarifications on Claim 2-10 and 17, hence the Contractor will commit to providing this response
by the 19th of October 2015.

The Contractor would appreciate a prompt written response to this extension request by the date stated
below.

Yours faithfully,
