Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer’s Instruction of reference 1) which ought to have been issued pursuant to
General Condition (“GC”) 13.1.1 of Volume 3 of the Contract, the Contractor encloses herewith full
particulars of its actual design costs related to the implementation of the Engineer’s Bulletin 1507/1.

The relevant Fee Change Notice (FCN) 071 includes payment requests from Atkins on account of other
design changes as well which are not relevant to the aforesaid instruction and hence no reference has
been made herein. Each of those has been addressed by the Contractor under a separate cover already.

As a direct consequence of this instruction to vary the works, the Contractor instructed Atkins to
perform additional work and has received a notice for additional payment by Atkins on account of the
additional design works entailed. Those can be summarized as per the following table:

FCN 071

(Eng. Bulletin) Amount claimed by Atkins
(QAR) ALYSJ JV Determination
(QAR) Amount paid to date
(QAR)
Atkins Lead Design

426,834.00

Atkins MEP Design

Atkins Total

Table 1) FCN071 (Eng. Bulletin): Amounts claimed by Atkins, ALYSJ JV Determination for the same and
payments to date

As detailed herein, the Contractor estimates that QAR 11,596,971.10 is a fair and reasonable
compensation to Atkins against the originally claimed value of QAR 17,643,520.89 which was, at the
Contractor’s opinion, overstated both in terms of the applicable staff rates and the respective time
spent.

The Contractor has enclosed as attachment 1) to this letter its determination of FCN 071.

Whilst noting that none of its aforementioned determination amounts have been agreed with Atkins as
full and sole compensation with the entire balance being the subject of an ongoing dispute, the
Contractor has nevertheless paid the amount of QAR 9,165,494.98 already, for which proof of payment
in the form of electronic payment (wire transfer) documents has been enclosed as attachment 2).

In any event, and whilst noting that the FCN 071 determination amount may be subject to further
change, the Contractor kindly requests the Employer to proceed with an interim, on-account payment of
its current determination value plus 12% for profits and overheads, in the net amount of QAR
10,265,354.38.

Such payment would be of invaluable assistance to the continued financing of the Project.

Yours faithfully,
