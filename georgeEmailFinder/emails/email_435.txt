Painting to Gatehouse Steelwork
Dear Sir
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described herein
may cause delay and disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.
The Event:
During the Weekly Progress Meeting held on 15 May 2019 we informed you that the specialist paint
[intumescent and cementitious fire proof spray paint] that was originally used to coat the exposed
steelwork to the Gatehouses is no longer manufactured. We contend that this is an unforeseeable
matter beyond our control that has arisen as a direct result of the prolongation of the Works.
Potential Impact:
If you require us to not only procure a suitable alternative paint system, have it approved, then re-coat
the structural steelwork to each of the Gatehouses, especially at this late stage of the Project, then this
is likely to have a major impact on our ability to achieve Milestones MS09B and MS09C.
It is for this reason that we hereby submit this E-Notice No. 0093.
Action Required:
We therefore request your prompt action, decision or further instruction as may be applicable to resolve
the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works. Kindly
ensure that such matters are resolved within ten (10) days from the date of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
Yours faithfully,
