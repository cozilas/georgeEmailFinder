Subject: Variation Order No. 336- Engineer's Instruction No. 212- Bulletin 114- Update of
Dear Sir,
We acknowledge receipt of your Variation Order No. 336 under the letter referenced
MTC-CMA-TCA-0401-LTR-8614 dated 03 December 2017.
We accept and agree to Variation Order No. 336 on the basis that the following items are not included
and
shall be evaluated separately:
Additional costs associated with engineering, contract administration, project administration and site
supervision for the changes;
Any costs associated with disruption, acceleration or price escalation;
Any non-security systems Works including those undertaken by the Passenger Boarding Bridge
Subcontractor;
Any necessary abortive work will be recorded and submitted separately.
The Variation was instigated by the Employer after Sub-Contract Signature and hence constitutes a
Variation in terms of the Contract. Consequently, our OH&P of 11.11% should apply to this Variation .
However, the Engineer determined the OH&P at 7%. To avoid hindering the progress of the appointed
ATRS Subcontractor and with the best interests of the project progress in mind, our signature of the
attached Variation Order is subject to resolving the difference in OH&P separately at a future date.
Accordingly, and as requested, we hereby return the signed originals of the attached Variation Order.
Once both Originals are signed by all parties, please provide one original to us for our records.
Subject:List of Agreed RFVO’s - Finishes
Dear Sir,
With reference to the above subject, please find attached list of agreed RFVO’s which have been
submitted in order for the Engineer to issue Variation Orders respectively. Please be informed that all
RFVO’s included in the enclosed list have been jointly assessed, reconciled and agreed since May 2013
up to December 2017, however, the fact remains that to date no Variation Order has been issued for the
listed RFVO’s.
In view of the above and due to the fact that the release of a Variation Order accordingly is long
overdue, pursuant to Contract Clauses 20.3.2 [Variation Procedure] and 11.4.1 [Determinations], we
pursue our contractual rights and kindly request your early determination and issuance of formal
Variation Orders correspondingly. Moreover, we kindly request that such determination and issuance is
within 14 days of receipt of this letter as required by Clause 11.4.1.

We hereby request for your immediate and necessary action for the issuance of these Variation Orders.
Yours Faithfully,
