Subject:Reply – Work Delay Notification
Dear Sir,
We acknowledge receipt of your letters referenced in (1) and (2) above respectively regarding the
subject matter.
We kindly inform you that payments for both packages as agreed in the Settlement Agreement (SAA),
were released timeously on 25th December 2018.
We hereby refute your assertion that the delays to your scope of works are attributed to the alleged
delays in releasing the payments. Please note that we have immensely supported you financially on this
project and such proactive support should be acknowledged.
It is also noted that the Subcontractor delayed accepting our Final Settlement offer, signing and
returning the Agreements as well as providing the financial securities as defined in the SAA.
We urge you to put in place the required mitigation measures to recover all delays you have caused to
your works in order to meet the milestone completion dates.
Any delays, costs, claims, losses and/or expenses and the like incurred by us and/or Other
Subcontractors arising as a result of your failure to complete the aforementioned activities will be solely
your responsibility as per the Subcontract Agreement Clauses including but not limited to 10.3
[Contractor’s Claims], 12.12.4 [Other Contractors and Other Subcontractors] and 16.6 [Delay Damages].
Yours faithfully,
