Engineer's Response to RFI/0401/17400 – Introduction of Gypsum Ceiling at CP Hotel L2.0 to Underside
of Elevator 0595 – Request for Engineer’s Instruction (RFEI) & Variation Order (VO)
Dear Sirs,
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
Your response to RFI/0401/17400 detailed in Annex A hereto, represents a change in design and scope
and requires a valid EI and VO in order for us to integrate the same into the Works.
Potential Impact
Delay and disruption due to the events and circumstances outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
likely to impact on the achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within seven (7) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
On 25 August 2019 we raised RFI/0401/17400 (ref: 1), requesting further clarification from you and/or
the Employer’s Design Consultant (KPF) in relation to the ceiling to the Underside of Elevator Lift 0595 at
CP Hotel L2.0, and whether a ceiling at this location is required or not (Figures 1 refers).
Figure 1
In addition to the photograph reproduced in Figure 1, also attached to RFI/0401/17400 were three (3)
extracts from various IFC Drawings as shown in Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4 below, which do not
indicate any ceiling required to the Underside of Elevator Lift 0595 at CP Hotel L2.0.

IFC – MTC A 02 TB

Accordingly, we asked that you clarify and confirm whether the underside of Elevator Lift 0595 at CP
Hotel L2.95 requires a ceiling or not given the fact that there is no ceiling shown in the IFC Drawings.
We requested a response to RFI/0401/17400 by 31 August 2019. However, you failed to reply until 23
calendar days later on 23 September 2019. Notwithstanding the prolonged period in responding, the
Employer’s Design Consultant confirmed the following:
“Contractor shall coordinate ceiling and stone edge at this area as commented in shop drawing 401-DMA-02-21-5.17B-CL-SD-015-01. In room 0070 @ L3.0, contractor to provide gypsum ceiling and stone edge
above it. Contractor to submit shop drawing clarifying all interfaces for review before proceeding on
site. No time/cost impact-”
In this regard, KPF’s reference to Shop Drawing No. 401-DM-A-02-21-5.17B-CL-SD-015-01 (refer to
extract shown in Figure 5) is incorrect since it relates to stone works and is irrelevant to the ceiling
works. Consequently, the clouded comments shown to the noted Shop Drawing for the “Contractor to
coordinate with landing and architectural ceiling cladding”, is not only incorrect but invalid on the basis
there exists no ceiling to ‘coordinate’ to the Underside of Elevator Lift 0595 at CP Hotel L2.0.
Figure 5

In addition to the above, IFC Drawing MTC A 42 TB L3.0 5.17 00.300 00, associated with ‘Enlarged
Reflected Ceiling Plan Level 3.0 Sector 5.17’, clearly indicates there is no ceiling to the Underside of
Elevator Lift 0595 (Figure 6 refers). We are not the designers for this Project, the Employer’s Design
Consultant is. Consequently, we accept no liability or responsibility for any inconsistencies in the
Design; this remains with the Employer’s Design Consultant. In this regard, we put on record that the
Works have been constructed by us based on IFC Drawings prepared by KPF and issued by you.

In summary therefore, it is evidently clear that your/KPF’s response to RFI/0401/17400: “In room 0070
@ L3.0, contractor to provide gypsum ceiling and stone edge above it…”, represents a change.
However, given that SAA8 laid down strict guidelines to follow if additional works are required and you
appear to have ignored those obligations, then this change will warrant a valid Engineer’s Instruction (EI)
and a Variation Order (VO) if you require us to proceed with integrating the revised scope into the
Works.
We therefore, take this opportunity in also reminding you of the provisions of Clauses 2.29 to 2.31 of
Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’) pertaining to Variations, in so far as we are not to
proceed with any Variation unless a Variation Order and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. In
which respect, it is your obligation to issue this Record first if you wish to instigate change; this is only
after the additional time and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.
Meanwhile, until such time as you take the action required of you in accordance with SAA8 Clause 2.29,
we are unable to proceed with implementing the changes noted above and will continue to proceed in
accordance with the existing IFC design to the extent we are able to.
Yours faithfully,
