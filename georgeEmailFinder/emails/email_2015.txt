Dear Sir,

The Contractor notes that Volume 6 - Employer's Requirements - Design Specifications, Section 11,
Clause
4.14.15 does not refer to any tunnel (trackside) wall advertising requirements whereas ABM Part 2
Section C
3.7 refers to an interactive proj ection featuring metro line colours on trackside wall. The projectors are
to be located underneath platform edge at about 5.5m intervals (enclosures 1 (a) & 1 (b)).

Also, ABM Part 2 Section D5 refers to L24 LED wall washer light fixtures along trackside wall implying
illumination of possible passive advertisements (enclosure 2).

Please confirm if it is required to keep both the projected advertising system as well as L24 wall washers.
We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.
Yours faithfully,
