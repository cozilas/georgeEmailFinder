Dear Sir,
We are in receipt of your letter referenced (4) which is a response to our letters referenced (2 & 3)
above and the previous correspondences referenced therein, confirming the Engineer’s Instruction for
the reinstatement of the works described as per the subject matter above.
For the avoidance of doubt, we would like to clarify our position regarding the cost and reiterate our
request as per the content of our aforementioned letters (2 & 3) as follows:
•
There is no cost or time impact with the re-introduction of the works omitted via EI No. 662 & EI
No. 662A. Nevertheless, a confirmation regarding the revised rates and quantities submitted via our
letter reference (1) is still pending;
•
There is a cost impact associated with the works of Stone Floor Installation with respect to the
revised layout of L3.0 Hotel Building Terrace. Therefore, a confirmation and/or approval of the changes
incorporated via Bulletin 137.1 and analysed under our submitted RFVO/0401/703-SC/061 is still
pending;
In light of the above, we shall consider your letter referenced (4) as an official confirmation that the
bullet-points above and the content of our letters reference (2 & 3) has been accepted. Please be
reminded that all of the above are explained in detail in our letters referenced (2 & 3).
We trust the above meets your approval and clarifies the matter; however, should you require any
further information, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Yours faithfully,
