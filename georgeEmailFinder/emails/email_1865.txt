Dear Sir,

We refer to the correspondence item 1 regarding the requirement for working capital for SELI Middle
East and respond as follows.

Please find enclosed a soft copy of the SELI Middle East executed Contract, M006-GDB-COM-AGR00212.

The Scope of works has been reduced recently by omission of all remaining work for TBM5. As regards
the working capital employed, the value of work completed to date is approximately QAR27 million with
QAR8.6 million of progress certified to date. The works progress has improved substantially since the descope, with no apparent issues relating to capital employed.

In light of the above change in circumstances we seek the EA’s direction in relation to the requirement.

Yours faithfully,
