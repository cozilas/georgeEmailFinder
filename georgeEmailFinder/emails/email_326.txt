Subject:Delay Notification â€“ BRS BLP Workstation Enclosure Material Approval
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to your letter (1), in which you notify us of our purported failure to submit a
material approval for the BRS BLP Workstation enclosure.
We disagree with your allegation that we failed to implement all necessary measures to mitigate delay
in the subject matter and remind you that commercial coordination was ongoing between us and our
Subcontractor prior to and following the sample mock up in March 2019.
We kept you updated and informed you weekly during the critical procurement meeting and AOS
progress meetings and you were made aware of our commitment for material approval requests (MAR)
and shop drawings to be submitted to you before 15th September 2019.
Following MAR approval, the unexpected 6 weeks delivery period was informed to you and ADAC.
We confirm that there was no impact recorded by you or CXA during performance testing, where we
introduced a temporary installation solution to overcome the longer than anticipated delivery period.
We conclude by reiterating that we remain fully committed to ADAC, the Project and to completing our
obligations within the shortest possible time, without compromising on safety and quality, but will not
be held responsible for such factors as those outlined above for which we are not culpable.
Yours faithfully,
