Dear Sir,

Further to its letter reference 2) the Contractor hereby reiterates that the Instruction issued under the
cover of letter reference 3) contains inconsistencies with respect to the Centralized Cooling Plant ‘CCP’
power supply and distribution scope of works.

The introduction and / or deletion of CCP power supply and distribution requirements to / from the
Contractor’s scope can be summarized as per the following table:

Contract CCP Requirements
QRC-EMT-IST-00166

EI No.84
Amended CCP Requirements

Original CCP Requirements

M006-

Volume 5: Nil

Volume 5: Addition of Sub-Clause 3.6.2.h

Volume 5: No Change

Volume 6: Nil
13.3.3.2

Volume 6: Addition of Sub-Clause 13.3.3.2

Volume 6: Deletion of Sub-Clause

Table 1) Evolution of CCP Power Supply and Distribution Requirements

Notwithstanding the omission of Volume 6, Sub-Clause 13.3.3.2 in its entirety, the Instruction of letter
reference 3) still contains Volume 5, Sub-Clause 3.6.2 h) whose second sentence reads as follows:

“The Contractor scope includes all design and installation of the power supply and distribution
equipment (from 33kV switchgear downwards) required for the Central Cooling Plant of Ras Bu Abboud
to properly operate”

The Contractor therefore kindly requests the issue of a formal Engineer’s Instruction amending that of
letter reference 3) as may be required and inclusive of a clear scope / interface apportionment matrix in
relation to the CCP power supply and distribution scope of works.

Yours faithfully,
