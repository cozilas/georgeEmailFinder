Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to letter reference 1), whereby the Engineer's Assistant requested "a cost analysis
for the implementation of the new concept of stations and tunnel cooling" and "detail assessment of
program impact for the implementation of the Centralised Cooling System."

The Contractor hereby acknowledges receipt of the Engineer's Assistant's request on 28 January 2015.
This request constitutes a direction pursuant to Sub-Clause 13.2.1 whereby the "Engineer may direct the
Contractor to submit a quotation (both as to price and any possible delay) for a proposed Variation. The
Contractor shall submit the quotation within the time specified in the direction or, if no time is specified,
within 14 days from the
direction."

The Contractor notes that the Engineer's Assistant directed the Contractor to submit the quotation by
29 January 2015. However, the Engineer's Assistant's direction was only received on 28 January 2015.
Notwithstanding the fact that the late receipt of the Engineer's Assistant's direction left the Contractor
with one day for the submission of the quotation, the Contractor advises that the quotation will be
submitted by 15 February 2015, which is a reasonable period given the complexity of this major
exercise.

Yours faithfully,
