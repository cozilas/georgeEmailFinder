Notice to Correct to Non-Attendance to site and Completion of works

Dear Sir,
We hereby write pursuant to the Subcontract Agreement referenced 1) above for “Design (If any),
Supply, Installation and the Rectification of defects therein of the Lift Steel Structure & Steel Stairs
including Miscellaneous Steel Works for Ramp and Ceiling Work Packages” and in regards to the above
mentioned subject matter. Further to our numerous reminders, we hereby express our concerns about
your non-attendance to the site and the non-completion of your outstanding works.
The majority of the outstanding works in Elevator Shafts are scaffolding installation & dismantling, touch
up & top coat painting, bracket welding due to wrong “Halfen” channels and incomplete steel erection.
Please see enclosed the list of outstanding works on site as of today (Attachment-1).
Therefore, we hereby instruct you under Subcontract Clause 22.1 [Notice to Correct] to
immediately proceed with the outstanding Works which we have already reminded you through several
correspondences.
Failing to comply with the above will result to a breach of Contract and consequent termination as per
Clause 22.2.2 [Termination by Contractor for Subcontractor Default] which clearly states the following
(for convenience, only sub-clauses applicable to you are given)
22.2.2 "The Contractor may, upon giving the Subcontractor seven (7) Days' notice, terminate the
Subcontract if the Subcontractor:
(a)
N/A
(b)
fails to comply with a notice under clause 22.1 (Notice to Correct);
(c)
abandons the Subcontract Works or otherwise plainly demonstrates the intention not to
continue performance of its obligations under the Subcontract;
(d)
without reasonable excuse, fails to proceed with the Subcontract Works in accordance with
clause 16 (Commencement, Delays and Suspension);
(e)
N/A
(f)
suspends the performance of the Subcontract Works or any part thereof other than in
accordance with clause 23.1 (Subcontractor’s Entitlement to Suspend Work) or as a consequence of
Force Majeure pursuant to clause 26 (Force Majeure) or as necessary for the safety or security of the
Subcontract Works;
(g)
persistently fails to execute the Subcontract Works in accordance with the requirements of the
Subcontract or persistently neglects to carry out and/or fulfil its obligations and/or responsibilities under

the Subcontract without due cause and the Contractor has given seven (7) Days' notice of its intention
to terminate the Subcontract unless the Subcontractor is able to satisfy the Contractor that appropriate
steps are being taken to ensure that there is no reoccurrence of such default;
(h)
N/A
(i)
having commenced the Subcontract Works on Site is unable or fails to proceed with the
Subcontract Works with due expedition (other than as a result of Force Majeure or Contractor breach);
(j)
N/A
(k)
N/A
(l)
N/A
(m)
N/A
(n)
the Subcontractor breaches the Subcontract or is otherwise in default of any of its obligations
under the Subcontract and such breach or default leads, either directly or indirectly, to the termination
of the Contractor's employment under the Contract.
We would like to remind you that in line with Clause 22.2.4 of the Subcontract between us: "Where any
of the circumstances described in Clauses 22.2.1 or 22.2.2 has occurred and the Contractor is entitled to
terminate the Subcontract, the Contractor may at its sole discretion, in lieu of such termination, elect to
omit a section(s) of the Subcontract Works by way of Variation, irrespective of whether the
circumstances described in Clause 22.2.1 or 22.2.2 have occurred in respect of such section(s) and may
instruct another Contractor to carry out such omitted work and the Subcontractor shall have no claim
for loss of profit or contribution to overheads which it would have earned for such omission".
Kindly note that in the event of such omission, the provisions of Clauses 22.3 (Consequences of
Termination for Subcontractor Default) to 22.5 (Payment after Termination for Subcontractor Default)
shall apply to such omitted section(s) as if the Subcontract had been terminated in respect of such
section(s).
Moreover, our right to omit a section(s) pursuant to Clause 22.2.4 shall be without prejudice to the
Contractor's right at any time to omit any part or section(s) of the Subcontract Works pursuant to Clause
20.1 (Right to Vary) but shall not be subject to any restrictions on giving such omitted work to another
Contractor at any time.
Hence, in addition to this Notice to Correct as highlighted here above, we would like to state our
intention for omitting the works from you and charge the cost of such omission as addressed under the
provisions of Clauses 22.3 (Consequences of Termination for Subcontractor Default) to 22.5 (Payment
after Termination for Subcontractor Default).
The above is without prejudice to our right to claim for any delays, costs, loses and/or expenses incurred
by us and/or other Subcontractors arising as a result of your breaches of the Subcontract.
Yours faithfully,
