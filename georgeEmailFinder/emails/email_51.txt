Subject: Subcontractor's Failure to Provide Reasonable Evidence of Payments to SubsubcontractorDear Sir,
With reference to the Contractor's Jetter r eference (1) and the Subcontractor's response reference (2)
above, the ContractorwoUild respond as fol:lows.
The appointment type of Ruskin Titus Gulf Manufacturing L.L.C. (i.e. as a Sub-subcontractor or a
supplier)
does not change the contractual position of the Contractor or the Subcontractor, specified in Sub-Clause
21.3.3 [Payments to Sub-subcontractors] of the Conditions of Subcontract.
The Contractor's demand for reasonablle evidence of payments is for all previous payments to the
Subsubcontractor
or the supplier, and is not li mited to the few months highlighted by the Subcontractor in the
letter reference (2). As such, the Subcontractor has failed to comply with the Contractor's demand as
required by Sub-Clause 21.3.3 [Payments to Sub-subcontractors) of the Conditions of Subcontract.
In light of the above, the Contractor shall withhold, pursuant to Sub-Clause 21.3.3.(a) of the Conditions
of
Subcontract, the total :amount, which the supplier has claimed as due (AED 631,990.46), from future
payments to the Subcontractor, until the Subcontractor resolves this issue with its supplier and provides
the Contractor with reasonab:le evidence for all payments to the supplier.
Moreover, the Contractor rejects the Subcontractor's assertion that the Contractor has prejudiced the
Subcontractor's ability to determine the amounts due to the Sub-subcontractors and/or suppliers. The
Subcontractor shall be responsible for the proper administration of its Sub-subcontract and/or supplier
packages, and the assessment of the value of the work done by each subcontractors and/or the
suppliers. Besides, the Contractor formally records this incident as another failure of the Subcontractor
to properly
administer its Sub-subcontract and/or supplier packages. The Contractor reserves its rights to recover
from the Subcontractor, pursuant to Sub-Clauses 10.3 [Contractor's Claim], 12.12 [Other Contractors
and
Other Subcontractors], 16.6 [Delay Damages] of the Conditions of Subcontract, all associated costs,
losses,
expenses and damages that may be incurred by the Contractor, due to the Subcontractor's failure to
comply with the Subcontractor's contractual obligations under the Subcontract.

Yours faithfully,
