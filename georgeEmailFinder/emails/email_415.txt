Dear Sir
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described herein
may cause delay [and/or disruption] to the Works, and accordingly seek your swift resolution of the
same
The Event(s):
On 7 March 2019, we submitted the following Shop Drawing Submittals seeking your approval of the
Airside Service Roads, Road Marking Layouts, Level L1.0, Sectors 8.11 and 8.32 (Table 1 refers).

Notably, both Shop Drawing Submittals were returned on 14 and 20 March 2019, annotated Code 3
advising us to ‘refer to comments in the attached [shop] drawings’. In turn, the comments detailed on
the Shop Drawings contained annotations that included the following statement(s):
“These locations are must be coordinated with MTA marking. There are access for apron”
Unsure what these comments meant, on 10 April 2019, we raised RFI/0401/17023-00 (dated 9 April
2019) which at its simplest, asked that you clarify the above comments and provide any updated IFC
drawings to allow us to revise the road marking shop drawings and re-submit them for approval.
On 27 April 2019, we received your response to RFI/0401/17023-00, attached to which were a total of
nine (9) sketches which you referred to as ‘CSK-0261.1 till CSK-0261.9 (RFI-0401-17023)’ albeit they were
for all intents un-dated but nevertheless revised IFC Drawings (the information recorded in Table 1
below, refers), which you advised contained ‘… the latest coordinated information.’

Additionally, your response to RFI/0401/17023-00 further advised that ‘[f]or clarity, the marking on
Airside is marked in blue’. Therefore, on the face of it the revised sketch drawings were issued for
information and coordination purposes only, but that said, on closer examination, some of the nine
sketches attached to your response to RFI/0401/17023-00 indicate additional directional arrows in some
areas with additional green painting that is required to be applied below the white paint.
Specifically, previously we had only a pedestrian crossing over the GSE road to the apron and that was
white paint only. The new sketches attached to the response to RFI/0401/17023-00 indicate additional
green hatching paintwork required where the BHS door exist (this appears to give an indication for bag
trolleys from where are allowed to enter the apron level). However, given that the green paint
interferes with the white pedestrian crossing, then it must be placed below white paint.
Therefore, we record that not only do the noted drawings contain revised road marking information that
will require us to revise our own road marking Shop Drawings, but given that they reflect works that is
additional to our existing scope, will necessitate that you re-issue these IFC Drawings under an
Engineer’s Instruction / Variation Order, if you require the additional work to be undertaken by us.
We therefore take this opportunity in also reminding you of the provisions of Clauses 2.29 to 2.31 of
Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’) pertaining to Variations, in so far as we are not to

proceed with any Variation unless a Variation Order and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. In
which respect, it is your obligation to issue this Record first if you wish to instigate change; this is only
after the additional time and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.
Meanwhile, until such time as you take the action required of you in accordance with SAA8 Clause 2.29,
we are unable to proceed with implementing any changes to our existing road marking works and will
continue with the Works in accordance with the current IFC Drawings. We trust this is clear.
Potential Impact:
Any requirement for additional works, in this case, additional road marking, at such a late stage of the
Project, is very likely to impact upon our ability to achieve Milestone MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required:
It is for this reason therefore that we issue this E-Notice requesting your prompt action, guidance,
decision or further instruction as may be applicable to resolve the matters referenced herein in order to
mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works. This includes without limitation:
1.
Issuing such Instruction as necessary for us to instigate the required changes into the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within ten (10) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
Yours faithfully,
