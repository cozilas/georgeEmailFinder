Subject:Re: Notice of Delay; TCAJV Target Programme to Completion Rev.10.4; Outstanding Preceding
Works by Other
Dear Sir,
We are in receipt of your letter referenced (1) above in which you are alleging that you have suffered
delays due to obstructions by others. This is to confirm that the issues raised in your mentioned letter
have been discussed and resolved during our meeting and confirmed by you via an email, enclosed
herewith. Therefore, we confirm that there are enough available work-fronts to proceed with your
works.
As discussed in previous correspondences, we once again reiterate that you are required to increase
your manpower to meet the requirements of the project. Specifically, the number of manpower has
been insufficient for a considerable amount of time, considering the volume of works on site. You are
required to have enough manpower to be able to coordinate the works on site with our construction
team.
We always remain available to assist you by all possible means to progress in all areas satisfactorily and
ensure that the target programme dates are met throughout the project.
This is for your information and necessary action.
Yours faithfully,
