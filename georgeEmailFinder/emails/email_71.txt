Subject:Re-Grouting Works to Pier 4 (GH 38) and Cracking to LB1 Slab
Dear Sir
We refer to your letter ref: (1) following issuance of our letters ref: (2) and (3).
We have consistently maintained that the subsidence that has occurred and continues to occur on this
Project (affecting both the MTB Works and the MTA Works), is not of our doing. We further remind you
that we are not the designers for this Project, the Employer’s Design Consultant is; it is their
responsibility, under your guidance, to provide us with the design of all the subsidence remediation
measures.
The re-grouting works to Pier 4 was designed by the Employer’s Design Consultant and instructed by
you. We have simply undertaken the grouting works as designed and instructed to do so. It is the
Employer’s Design Consultant who insisted on deeper grouting, despite us hitting ‘competent rock’ at a
higher level to achieve the minimum SPT value, and despite it being apparent that some areas are
unlikely to achieve this due to the non-porous nature of the material that will not allow any grout
permeation to occur. It is for you in conjunction with Employer’s Design Consultant to determine the
cause of the cracking to the raft slab to Level LB.1; it is not due to any fault or culpability on our part; nor
can it be construed as such. That is why we object to you perceiving this as a ‘defect’ and unequivocally
reject NCR-01630 (ref: 4).
Given that the Employer’s Design Consultant is responsible for the design of the subsidence remediation
measures, and is responsible for the design of the structure (including the Basement), then it is
imperative for you to urge that he takes the lead on this and that you instruct us following his
recommendations.
Meanwhile, our rights and entitlements to additional time and payment pursuant to Sub-Clause
16.5.1(c) and Clause 21.1 pursuant to Clause 9.10, arising in consequence of your continued failure to
resolve this issue and instruct us as previously notified in letters ref: (2) and (3) and repeated herein, are
reserved.
Yours faithfully,
