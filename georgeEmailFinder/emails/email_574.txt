Points to include in response to the following letters from the Subcontractor:
I.
The Subcontractor’s letter reference MMM/18/MTB/176 dated 19 November 2018.

II.
The Subcontractor’s letter reference MMM/18/MTB/181 dated 9 December 2018 regarding
Time Impact Analysis for the period of year 2015-2016 (Part-1).
III.
The Subcontractor’s letter reference MMM/18/MTB/184 dated 15 December 2018 regarding
Time Impact Analysis for the period of year 2017 (Part-2).
1.
The Subcontractor’s letter reference MMM/18/MTB/176 dated 19 November 2018 is in
response to the Contractor’s letter reference MTB/TCA/MOSART/L/000622 dated 16 October 2018
received by the Subcontractor on 22 October 2018.
2.
In this letter the Contractor provided comments on its initial review of the Subcontractor’s
Extension of Time (EOT) Claim no. 4. The letter also included the Contractor’s comments on the
Subcontractor’s EOT Claims nos. 2 and 3.
3.
The Subcontractor’s response is surprising (letter …176 dated 19 November 2018). It contradicts
the Subcontractor’s agreement with the points raised by the Contractor, meeting in TCAJV site office 11
October 2018. The discussion points were confirmed in Contractor’s letter …622 dated 16 October 2018
.
4.
Contractor hereby re-iterates and expands its responses to the Subcontractor’s comments
(letter …176), in the same order as the Subcontractor’s letter.
5.
Item-1: The Contractor’s letter describes the Subcontractor’s lack of contractual compliance
related to timely delay notices and correspondences. The Subcontractor’s reply does not address the
Contractor’s comments, it refers to generic weekly reports.
6.
Item-2/2a: The Subcontractor responded that the prospective delay fragnets used in the claims
are interim and will be updated once the actual access is granted. The amount of delay in each window
should only be assessed up to the cut-off date of each period. Prospective impacts beyond the window
period are/remain theoretical until actualised in later window periods. One of the reasons for not
applying prospective impacts beyond the window is, it hides the true critical path at the window cut-off
period. i.e. impact events/fragnets should be applied/extended progressively in successive windows
until either actualised or forecast to the end of the last window.
7.
Page 23, Paragraph 5.1.5 of the Subcontractor’s EOT Claim no. 4 submitted by letter reference
MMM/18/MTB/149 received on 17 September 2018 states the following; “The logic and activity dates of the update programme were amended at this point to accurately reflect
the impact upon subsequent activities resulting from the delay event.”
Accordingly, under item-2b, the Contractor requested the list of these modifications. However, the
Subcontractor’s response below is inconsistent with its previous position.
“There is no changes to the progress updates whilst preparing the TIA, therefore the Contractor’s
comment in this respect is not valid.”
8.
Item-2c(i.): The Subcontractor stated, “…the updated progress programme is chosen as of “prior
to” the delay events in question, which is a basic principal of the TIA method”. Contractor agrees with
this statement in principle, subject to the following.
The Subcontractor has used two progress updates with data dates of 21 January 2018 and 22 July 2018
to carry out TIA under the Subcontractor’s EOT Claim no. 4. Based on the Subcontractor’s statement in
item-2c(i.), the Subcontractor has carried out TIA for delay events occuring after the data date of 21
January 2018.
Any delays prior to 21 January 2018 have to be assessed using TIA’s under Subcontractor’s EOT Claims 1
and 2. As explained below the Subcontractor has not carried out any delay analysis (TIA) under EOT
Claim 1 or 2.
9.
Item-2c(ii.): The Subcontractor stated, “To establish the fact that there is no access to most of
the area, it is sufficient to use a programme having a data of January 2018…”. The Contractor agrees
with this as a general statement, the Subcontractor would be entitled to an EOT due to Contractor

delays in providing access. However, without a proper delay analysis concurrency cannot be established,
which is required to determine the amount of compensable delay.
10.
Item-2c(iii.): The Subcontractor stated, “the delay events are mostly related to ‘design details’”.
A claim based on prospective fragnets may in theory produce entitlement to an EOT. However, the
amount of entitlement to EOT and compensable periods will depend on the liabilities for critical actual
delays, which can only be established through a proper delay analysis.
11.
The Subcontractor stated that the TIA was carried out in windows. Window 1 starts in January
2018 and ends in March 2018. Window 2 starts in July 2018 and ends in August 2018. If the
Subcontractor had used TIA in windows, then the Subcontractor should have curtailed the delay fragnet
within the window period. Also, the window periods should be continuous. It is not clear why the
Subcontractor has used windows when the delay fragnets starting January 2018 extend to 31 December
2018.
12.
Similarly, under item-2c(iv.), the Subcontractor explains that the two TIA’s carried out with data
dates of 21 January 2018 and 22 July 2018 are ongoing (interim). Accordingly, the assessment for
entitlement under these delay events will be finalised once the events are actualised.
13.
Item-2d: The Subcontractor stated, “Delay events may contain “actual dates”, but the updated
progress programme does not contain any actual date greater than the data date.”
The screenshot below - taken from the Subcontractor’s TIA programme with data date of 21 January
2018 - shows the ‘original programme activities’ with progress/actual dates after the data date. The
Subcontractor stated, “delay events may contain “actual dates””. The Contractor agrees that delay
events before/left of the data date should use actual dates. However, activities after/right of the data
date are forecasts, should not be actualised for two reasons. Firstly, they obviously cannot have
happened at this time (if the data date is correct). Secondly, applying actual dates after the data date
incorrectly distorts the logical scheduling of the remaining activities including the critical path.
14.
Item-2e: The Subcontractor stated, “The only constraints, are on the fragnets…”. The approved
baseline programme included six (6) constraints. The Subcontractor’s TIA programme dated 21 January
2018, contains 261nr constraints, of which 84nr are applied to delay fragnet activities.
15.
Adding constraints in fragnets can be acceptable. However, the Subcontractor should not make
modifications to baseline programme activities/logic through the addition of constraints (or other
measures), without providing a reasonable explanation(s). The screenshot below – taken from the
Subcontractor’s TIA programme dated 21 January 2018 - provides examples of constraints added to the
original baseline programme activities.
16.
Item 2f: The Subcontractor stated, “the TIA has not been reviewed properly, with comments
raised without an understanding of the programme, the delay events, and the way they are impacted.”.
The aforementioned statement is unacceptable given the examples below, which demonstrate the
Subcontractor’s improper application of TIA methodology.
17.
The Subcontractor’s EOT claims are summarised in Table 1.

An EOT of 285 days had already been awarded prior to Subcontractor’s Claim no. 1, based on
Contractor’s Revision-6 Programme issued by letter references MTB/TCA/MOSART/L/000103 dated 25
March 2015 and MTB/TCA/MOSART/L/000110 dated 17 May 2015.
19.
Based on the Contractor’s Revision-6 Programme, the Subcontract Commencement Date and
the Time for Completion were revised based on the Heads of Agreement (HOA) – 1 with the Employer
dated 5 March 2015. The contractual dates and the revised dates based on HOA-1 are summarised in
Table 2.

20.
Accordingly, there was no requirement for a delay analysis for the analysis period of 83 days
(Table 1) covered under the Subcontractor’s EOT claim no. 1. However, an analysis of concurrency is
required to establish the amount of compensable delay within Claim no.1.
21.
EOT Claim no. 2, covers a period of 787 days (Table 1).
22.
The Subcontractor’s EOT Claim no. 2 (letter reference MMM/18/MTB/024 received on 18
February 2018) provided only two sentences under Section 6 heading ‘Delay Analysis’:
“1. The impact of delayed access has been inserted into the Updated Baseline Programme and shows
that completion of the Subcontract Works would have been delayed to 12th September 2017 due to
these events, which is beyond the period currently claimed in this Claim No 02 to 30th April 2017.
2. The Time Impact Analysis is enclosed as Appendix C”
23.
Appendix C provided a hard copy of a progress update (not a delay impact analysis) as of end of
November 2016 (data date not shown in the hard copy). There is no delay impact analysis carried out by
the Subcontractor.
24.
Clearly the Subcontractor had not performed a credible TIA to establish its entitlement to any
EOT within the period ‘analysed’ (787 days).
25.
EOT Claim no. 3, covers a period of 245 days (Table 1).
26.
The Subcontractor’s EOT Claim no. 3 (letter reference MMM/18/MTB/043 received on 14 March
2018) provided only two sentences under Section 6 heading ‘Delay Analysis’:
“1. The impact of delayed access has been inserted into the Updated Baseline Programme and shows
that completion of the Subcontract Works would have been delayed to 11th October 2018 due to these
events, which is beyond the period currently claimed in this Claim No 03 to 31st December 2017.
2. The Time Impact Analysis is enclosed as Appendix C”
27.
Appendix C provides a hard copy of a progress update (not a delay impact analysis) as of
February 2018. There is no delay impact analysis performed by the Subcontractor.
28.
Clearly the Subcontractor had not performed a credible TIA to establish its entitlement to any
EOT within the period ‘analysed’ (245 days).
29.
EOT Claim no. 4, covers a period of 243 days (Refer Table 1).
30.
The Subcontractor’s EOT claim no. 4 (letter reference MMM/18/MTB/149 received on 17
September 2018) included TIA’s with data dates 21 January 2018 and 22 July 2018. These prospective
TIA’s are ongoing (interim) and will be assessed once the actualised delay impacts are submitted by the
Subcontractor.
31.
Item 3: The Subcontractor stated, “we are currently preparing a full TIA of 48 monthly
windows”. Subsequently, the Subcontractor has submitted TIA’s Part-1 and Part-2 (which combine to

give 29 out of 48 monthly window analyses, refer letter references MMM/18/MTB/181 dated 9
December 2018 and MMM/18/MTB/184 dated 15 December 2018.
32.
Part-1 contains the TIA’s for the period Yr.2015 – Yr.2016. Part-2 contains the TIA’s for Yr.2017.
Part-3 - containing the TIA’s for Yr.2018 - is awaited from the Subcontractor.
33.
The Contractor has made an initial review of the Subcontractor’s Part-1 and
Part-2 submissions as follows:
34.
In both Part-1 and Part-2 submissions the Subcontractor concludes the executive summary as
follows:
“The Subcontractor considers that it is entitled to an Extension of the Subcontract Time for Completion
as a result of the delay events occurring each month due to "DELAY DUE TO PARTIAL / NO ACCESS TO
WORK AREAS". The total Extension of the Subcontract Time for Completion claimed by the
Subcontractor will be presented in part-3 of the report.
The Costs arising as a result of the delay event are evaluated and will form part of the submission. The
details of Cost calculation will be provided in the final Part i.e. Part-3 of the report covering the whole
period from August 2015 till Dec 2018.”
35.
Accordingly, the Subcontractor has not concluded any of its claims for EOT/Cost for the period
2015-2017 covered under Part-1 and Part-2.
36.
The Subcontractor’s delay analysis methodology in Section 5, paragraphs 7 and 8 states; “7. The delay fragnets are added to each month, as a separate WBS-Delay Event. The delay fragnets /
activities are WIRs, based on their zones, level, sector, Section, and the Site access details / request.
8. The previous month file containing the delay events then becomes the base-file for the next month
delay events, this file is then updated in accordance with the available update / submitted monthly
update and delay fragnets for the current month are added to it. The Programme is scheduled and
analyzed. This process continues.”
37.
The Subcontractor’s statement concerning the application of the TIA methodology is correct.
However, the Subcontractor (as illustrated Table 3) has not in practice applied the method as written.
38.
The purpose of performing a TIA in monthly windows is to assess the liabilities of
delay/mitigation/acceleration in monthly windows and assess the monthly variations to the critical path.
39.
However, the monthly windows in the Subcontractor’s TIA report does not include a simple
summary table of delay (claimed entitlement or liabilities of the critical delays) within each window. The
results of the Subcontractor’s analysis are not evident in the narrative.
40.
Instead, Contractor has had to review the Subcontractor’s ‘detailed’ appendices to determine
the periods of delay claimed in each window. This has revealed several significant anomalies, refer Table
3.

The

update period).
41.
The example in Table 3 shows that the delay fragnets did not impact the completion dates in the
Subcontractor’s 24 April 2016 and 22 May 2016 progress updates.

42.
As noted in Table 3 the progress updates at 24 April 2016 and 22 May 2016 cover a 28 days
period. However, the completion date forecast in each shows a difference of 160 days. Contractor
observed that this is due to logic changes and other amendments applied to progess data. For example,
removing actual dates (de-statusing) in the 22 May 2016 update that had been assigned in the previous
update.
43.
The Subcontractor should use the original approved baseline programme (unamended) logic
and any additional logics should be applied using the delay fragnets.
44.
The Subcontractor should review the progress updates and any discrepancies should be
explained in the delay analysis report. It is essential that the Subcontractor’s analysis is based on reliable
and consistent progress data.
