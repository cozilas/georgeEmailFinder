Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to its letter at reference 1 above regarding the encroachments of techn ical spaces
or egress stairs at the end of the platforms and in particular to the date of 05 May 2015 for submission
of its fully detailed claim for the same.

Due to the fact that there has been a large number of Engineer's Instructions issued simultaneously in
recent times and coupled with the fact that the Contractor has just recently submitted its combined
claim for the revised ELS requirements, the Contractor respectfully requests the Engineer's consent to
extend the date for submission of the fully detailed claim for Claim No. 014 from 05 May 2015 to 05
June 2015.

Yours faithfully,
