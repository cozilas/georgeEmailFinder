Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to letter reference 1) with regards to the Station Area Planning. To date, the
Contractor has attended numerous SAP coordination workshops with CPO/QR/PMC as outlined below:

Al Sadd - 08 July 2015
Qatar National Museum Station - 12 July 2015 Joaan Station
- 26 July 2015 Al Sudan Station - 26 July 2015
Sport City Station

- 12 July 2015 Ras Bu Abboud Station

- 26 July 2015

Bin Mahmoud Station - 26 July 2015
Al Waab Station- 30 July 2015
Souq Waqif Station

- 30 July 2015

Al Aziziyah Station

- 30 July 2015

During these workshops the Contractor presented to CPO, Employer and Engineer the extent to which
design changes can be made to accommodate the latest SAP layouts which were issued in May 2015 :

1.
At the workshop of 30 July 2015 the Contractor was advised that the revised SAP drawings for Al
Sadd Station would be issued in the following week.
2.
The Contractor received comments from CPO and PMC regarding its presentations on 26 and 30
July 2015 on 04 and 16 August 2015.
3.

The Contractor organized a workshop on 18 August 2015 to address these comments.

4.
. At the same workshop, the Contractor was asked to clarify a few more issues for Bin
Mahmoud, Souq Waqif and Joaan Stations.
5.
The Contractor committed that these outstanding issues would be addressed at the meeting of
23 and 29 August 2015 .
6.
It was the general consensus that the remaining issues were not difficult to resolve with the
exception of the Joaan Station wherein CPO is of opinion that the vent shafts should be relocated to
other side of the road.

On 01 September 2015, the Employer submitted to the Contractor, by means of an informal email under
reference MOOO-QRC-INFM-010596 - CP0_ 15_04534 SAP for Gold Line Underground Stations, the
following SAP drawings:

In addition, the Contractor has obtained informal SAP drawings for the Al Sadd and Al Waab Stations
from CPO.

Time is of essence and therefore, notwithstanding the absence of formal issuance of the SAP drawings
from the Engineer under the relevant instruction, the Contractor will proceed with the detailed design in
order to mitigate further delay. On this this note, the Contractor urges the Engineer and the Employer to
assist in obtaining the SAP drawings for the remaining stations (Souq Waqif and Joaan) as soon as
possible.

The implementation of SAP requirements , which must be formally instructed, constitute a Variation and
upon receipt of the Engineer's instruction, the Contractor shall proceed in accordance with the
provisions of Clause 13 [Variations and Adjustments] of Volume 3 - Conditions of Contract.

In this respect, the Engineer is kindly requested to obtain the Employer's written confirmation of its
agreement to implement the revised SAP drawings and instruct accordingly in order to avoid and/or
minimize abortive design.

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.
Yours faithfully,
