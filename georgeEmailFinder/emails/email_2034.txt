Dear Sir,

Subject to ongoing discussions with the Engineer and the Engineer’s Assistant, the Contractor was
informally instructed to exclude the following element of Engineer’s Instruction Reference 2) from its
Scope of Works:

“Volume 5, Sub-Clause 3.5.14
Lot 2.2, AI Sadd Station, enhancements of the pedestrian crossing at AI Quds signal, subject to MOTCLTPD review and approval, are to be provided”

The Contractor kindly requests the Engineer formalize the above by issuing a revised Instruction.

Yours faithfully,
