Subject: Elevator Clear Laminated Glass Type GLZ-31
Dear Sir,
We hereby write further to your response to our above referenced submission for additional costs due
to
the Engineer implementing a change of glazing type via its letter dated 09 April 2015.
In light of your rejection to our petition for additional costs, we take the opportunity to correct a
number
of incorrect statements made in your response dated 02 May 2018.
The original IFC Glazing Specification indicates forty-three typ.es of glass to be used on the project of
which
fourteen are described as clear laminated glass. It is therefore preposterous to suggest that the
Contractor
should assume the use of glass type GLZ-31 for all elevator glazing. The description of GLZ-31 within the
Glazing Specification gives no indication that it is to be used as standard within the glass elevators.
Likewise the Elevator Specification makes no indication that GLZ-31 shall be used.
Therefore, we record our disagreement with your rejection of our ROM 1780.
Yours faithfully,
