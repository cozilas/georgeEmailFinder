Subject: 	Request for an Engineer’s Instruction: Acceleration of the Works 

Dear Sir/Madam,
We write with reference to the recent meeting attended by the Employer’s, the Engineer’s and the Contractor’s representatives on 8 February 2021, within which the Employer has expressed its intention to request for an acceleration of the works to complete the Project by September 2021. 
In view of the Employer’s request, we wish to put on record that the duration of the works as per the Contract is 365 days pursuant to Sub-Clause 1.1.3.3 [Time for Completion] of Part A-Contract Data. 
As a result, we kindly request you to confirm, if indeed, the Employer’s request to accelerate the works will be put in effect, in order for us to develop a detailed proposal to achieve a revised completion date.
In addition, in the event the Employer indeed wishes to proceed with an accelerated program, then a formal Engineer’s Instruction (EI) as per the Contract Clause 3.3 [Instructions of the Engineer], has to be issued accordingly.
We remain at your disposal for any additional confirmation and/or clarification on the above.
Yours faithfully,
