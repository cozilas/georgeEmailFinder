Dear Sir,

This is a direction under Sub-Clause 13.2.1 for the Contractor to submit a quotation that shall include
both price and any potential time impact for a proposed Variation in relation to a proposed amendment
to the Scope requirements associated with Autowalks as referenced in Volume 6, Employer's
Requirements
- Section 13, Item 13.3.3.12 Elevators, Escalators and Autowalks - a, iii. The current wording in the above
reference is:
Autowalks shall be provided for the horizontal movement of passengers in the pedestrian tunnels,
where people need to walk long distances. Autowalks shall be provided for pedestrian bridges exceeding
40m length and that lead to station's remote entrances.

ALYSJ is to consider the following proposal and submit accordingly:

The proposal is to amend the minimum overall length of subways/bridges requiring the installation of
travelators (autowalks) from 40 meters (current) to 100 meters in the initial fit-out phase.

ALYSJ are to note that their proposal islo also include a specific provision that for all subways I bridges
that are less than 100 meters but greater than 40 meters in overall length, Contractor will allow for the
structure to include installation of Autowalks by others at a later date if the need arises.

The proposal is also to define the maximum walking distance without a travelator as being 12 meters
and the runoffs at either end of a travelator as being 6 meters. The maximum length for any travelator
shall not exceed 50 meters.
Dear Sir,
