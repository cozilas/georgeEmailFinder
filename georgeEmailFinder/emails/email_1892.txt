Dear Sir,

We had commented in our response to your Master Programme submission of 31-Dec-14 that STKID
milestones for Al Aziziyah station be included in your first programme update.

In accordance with the Contract Vol. 3., Appendix 2A (options exercise protocol) clauses, you are hereby
reminded to include STKID 1, STKID 2, and STKID 3 milestones for Al Aziziyah station and demonstrate, in
Master Programme update, that all activities required to achieve these milestones are completed on
time to achieve the same STKID dates as all other stations
Yours faithfully,
