Re: Notice of Delay- Removed and Damaged Works

Dear Sir,
We are in receipt of your letter referenced (1) above, wherein you are notifying us about the removal of
materials by others after our instructions. You have also expressed your intention to claim additional
costs in the event there is “re-supply of missing and damaged material, reinstallation of removed
material, repair of damages and re-alignment, time delays, etcetera”.

In view of the above, please be informed that we acknowledge your contractual right to submit any
claim which you may be entitled; however, you also have the contractual obligation to keep correct
signed records, identifying the parties involved and provide the information in a timely manner.
Additionally, we refute your comments in the second and third paragraph of the second page of your
letter that the “Contractor has repeatedly, without any notification or coordination with the
Subcontractor, disrupted the Subcontractor's progress […]”, and inform you that we are taking all
necessary measures, following the Subcontract provisions to ensure the timely progression of the works
whilst you are sufficiently informed accordingly.
We trust the aforementioned information is self-explanatory and you will carry out the necessary
actions accordingly.
Yours faithfully,
