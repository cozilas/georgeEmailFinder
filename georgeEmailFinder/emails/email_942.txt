Subject AMC Area (Office Building) Outstanding & Interface Works Completion
Dear Sir,
Further to the above referenced letter (1) and (2) the Engineer would like to advise the Contractor that
ARCO Interiors are progressing with their fit out installation works and in order not to adversely impact
their progress we urge the Contractor to complete all outstanding and incomplete works in this Third
Party, AMC area, Office Building L3.1, and ensure the completion of the snag and de-snag WIR process.
The Engineer also highlights that the dates agreed in the coordination workshop on 27 February 2018
between ARCO and the Contractor in the presence of the Engineer, regarding the completion dates of
the interface services have been not been met despite the Contractor's commitment.
The Engineer requests the Contractor to provide its completion strategy for the outstanding and
interface works within the next 5 working days, upon receipt of this letter.
Your urgent action in this matter is appreciated
Yours faithfully,
