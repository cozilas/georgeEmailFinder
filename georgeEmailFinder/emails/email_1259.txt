Dear Sir,
With reference to the above subject, we enclose M/S Deemah Stoneâ€™s letter referenced (2) above,

You are hereby instructed pursuant to Clause 11.3 [Instructions of the Contractor], to proceed and take
necessary action on obtaining a Code 1 for the works mentioned on the letter referenced (2) above,
