Dear sir
This is an instruction under Sub-Clause 3.3.1 regarding the execution of the work under the Contract.
The following Employer's Requirements:
Volume 6 Sub-Clause 11.4.6.13: Maximum rise to direction change: 2 flights Volume 6 Section 12 SubClause 1.3
In the situations where there is an additional level between concourse and platform the escalators
double back on the intermediate level converging towards the centre of the platform.

are relaxed as follows:

For stairs between concourse and platform up to four flights shall be acceptable without a change in
direction. In addition escalators between concourse and platform are not required to double back at the
intermediate level.

"In the situations where there is an additional level between concourse and platform the escalators
double back on the intermediate level converging towards the centre of the platform", is relaxed.

The above has been technically agreed in the Engineering escalation meeting held on 28 January 2015.
The time and cost saving to the Employer will be discussed and agreed at a later date.
Yours faithfully,
