Reply - Comments on Insurance Policies

Dear Sir,
It is very concerning that you continuously fail to fulfil your Subcontract obligations with regards to
submitting compliant Insurance Policies as per Schedule 14 [Insurances] of the Subcontract as well as
Appendix ‘N’ of the tender documents, almost a year on the project.
We hereby reject the content of your letter referenced (9) above, wherein you are trying to deviate
from the already agreed Conditions of the Subcontract, asserting that you are not obligated to provide a
compliant Professional Indemnity Insurance. In this regard, you are referred to the enclosed Subcontract
Agreement Pages 567 & 580 respectively, which clearly outline your obligations for the provision of the
Insurances.
You are reminded that as per Clause 5.1 of Schedule 11 [Payment Terms] “No amount shall be paid to
the Subcontractor until the Contractor has received and approved […] evidence of the Subcontractor’s
Insurances […]”.
Notwithstanding the above, we have proceeded as a gesture of goodwill, with releasing payments
(including the Advance Payment) to assist your cashflow, to ensure that you expedite your performance
in the project and all Insurances are submitted in a timely manner, as required. However, to date, you
have failed to submit all required Insurances within the stipulated period.
In view of the above, we reiterate that you are required to revise and resubmit your Insurance Policies
as per our comments made vide our letter referenced (8) above to avoid any delays in releasing your
payments.

This is for your utmost attention and immediate action

Yours faithfully,
