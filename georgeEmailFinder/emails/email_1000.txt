Subject: Notice of Delay due to Poor Sub-Subcontractor Performance
Dear Sir,
We write to you with regards to our constant concerns pertaining to your capability to manage your
SubSubcontractor
for the works package of Fire Stopping {CHRONICLE).
Further to our aforementioned letter references, we are once again forced to place on our record of
your
poor performance for the relevant activities. {See Appendix 1) Your failure to manage your
Subcontractor
and that of its inadequate labour resources and engineering issues are completely unacceptable and will
no longer be entertained. The extent of outstanding works to be completed by your Fire Stopping
Specialist Subcontractor is extensive.
The consequences of the highlighted outstanding activities hereunder Appendix-1 have immense impact
on the Consultant approval of inspections and subsequent delays of the room handovers and ceilings
closure.
Therefore and for the record, all costs incurred by us with regards to the secondment of additional
labour
resources to supplement your insufficient workforce will be for your account and in strict accordance
with
that of Clause 10.3 {Contractors Claims) of the Subcontractor Agreement between us. The same will be
subject to 15% Overhead & Profit I Administration Charges.
Yours faithfully,
