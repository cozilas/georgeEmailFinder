Dear Sir,
We have ascertained that your project manager has failed to carry out her responsibilities and duties in
accordance with the Project Requirements in a timely manner.
It has been witnessed that your project manager Ms Antel lliovits has failed to following site activities
closely and
dealing with our site management very unprofessionally. Moreover, she keeps misleading our team and
giving
false reports and information to obscure her failures.
Aforementioned failures by your project manager cause delays to achievement of the critical milestone
dates.
Therefore, we hereby issue a warning letter in pursuant to the Clause 14.9.3 that of the Subcontractor
Agreement;
'The Contractor may require the Subcontractor to remove (or cause to be removed} any key personnel
or any other
person employed on the Site or Subcontract Works, including the Subcontractor's Representative if
applicable, who
in the reasonable opinion of the Contractor:
(a) persists in any misconduct or lack of care
(b) carries out duties incompetently or negligently
(c) fails to conform with any provisions of the Subcontract; or
(d) persists in any conduct which is prejudicial to safety, health or the protection of the Environment"
Our instruction is issued according to the Conditions of Subcontract Agreement Clause 12.12 where the
Subcontractor is required to cooperate with the Contractor to ensure the coordination including
timeframes,
programmes and schedules for the completion of the Subcontract Works. As she informed previously,
please take
immediate actions to fix the problems on the site not later than 2 weeks. Failing such, we shall
determine a
solution to overcome the above issue at your own cost which we will inform you in due course include
the removal
of the responsible staff
Yours faithfully,
