Subject Notice to correct- Shortage of Manpower NAFFCO
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence (1) wherein the Engineer notified the Contractor of his
concerns in relation to the levels of manpower on site and requested that the Contractor corrects the
decline in their resources. Amongst the Subcontractors referred in correspondence (1) was also PCEJV.
During a site walk which took place today it was evident that NAFFCO employees (Subcontractor to
PCE.JV) are not present on site. Out of the 175 that were reported 2 days ago, only 9 are on site today.
This is unacceptable given the critical stage of the Project and the lack of required manpower will have
an adverse effect on the commissioning activities, snagging and room completion and potentially affect
the target to take over Pier 4 on 15 December 2019.

We hereby provide notice pursuant to Clause 12.10.1 of the Conditions of Contract and request that
the Contractor implements immediate measures to rectify this issue and ensure that their
Subcontractor retains the required resources at all time on site.
Yours faithfully,
