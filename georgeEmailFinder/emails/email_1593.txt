Dear Sir,

Following the Contractor's letter referenced above, the Engineer's Assistant acknowledges the receiving
of Contractor's Value Engineering Proposal - Alternative Layout for Ras Bu Abboud Switch Box and
Stabling Yard.

We note that the VE Proposal is based on the Reference Design as augmented by Engineer's Instruction
No.51, when in fact the Contractor should have based its VE Proposal on the Baseline Reference Design.
The reason for such an approach is due to the fact that during the period between the issuance of El
No.51 (6 May 2015) and the receiving of Contractor's VE proposal (29 July 2015), there has been no
approval of the modified Detailed Design (in accordance with El No.51) submitted on 3 May 2015.

Considering the above the Contractor is requested to provide its Value Engineering Proposal based on
the Baseline Reference Design and including the impact on the Works already executed, within fourteen
(14) days from receiving this letter.

This is ue and your response are becoming critical to ensure an agreed path forward is considered as
soon a practicable. We look forward to your positive focus on the above.

Yours faithfully,
