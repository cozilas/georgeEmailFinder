Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to letters referenced 1 and 2 above, whereby the Engineer's Assistant requested a
quotation relating to both the timing and price for a Variation proposed by the Engineer regarding the
Optimisation of the station entrances.

The optimisation detailed in the Engineer's Assistant's letter will require significant redesign and as such
it is not possible to provide a quotation for these Works untilthe design is completed. The Co.ntractor
has requested a quotation from its Lead Designer to design these works and will provide it following its
receipt.

Further to the above, the Contractor has carried out a preliminary report on the impact to the VHTS
associated with this entrance optimisation which is attached for your reference. The impact to the VHTS
scope of Works is detailed as follows:

Reduction for Elevators Reduction for Escalators Total Reduction
Subsequent reduction in Contractors Margin @ 4%
Total saving associated with VHTS

10,444,158.00 QAR
6,251,546.00 QAR
16,695,704.00 QAR
667,828 .16 QAR
17,363,532.16 QAR
Please note that the above calculation does not take into account any of the instructed cost
optimizations. as the Contractor has not yet received confirmation as to the breakdown of the savings,
and how they will be split across the lines included in Kone's order. There would likely be a further
saving through the Maintenance Contract, which Qatar Railwill enter into with Kone. However,the
Contractor has no visibility of this Agreement, and as such cannot price this Work.

Yours faithfully,
