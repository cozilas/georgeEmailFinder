Subject:Subsidence Rectification Programme â€“ CIPP Lining to Sewer Pipeline
Delayed Receipt of Instructions for Pier 4 Scope of Works
Dear Sir,
We refer to your letter ref: (1) the content of your subsequent e-mail ref: (2) and letter ref: (3).
Your letter ref: (1) instructed is to procure the CIPP relining system and on the basis of this instruction
we directed Applusvelosi to order the material. This has a very limited shelf life of six months. Your
letter also directed us to undertake the re-lining to Pier 4 yet the full scope of [grouting works] works
and the preferred sequence of works, at that point (i.e. 8 May 2019) had yet to finalized and agreed
We have since agreed between us to grout under the pipes before lining; despite your earlier e-mail (ref:
2) suggesting otherwise. However, you have only just issued letter ref: (3) enclosing EI No. 773B that
instructs the full scope of sewer and storm water rectification works, albeit again limited to Pier 4, which
is ten weeks after we were first instructed to order the CIPP relining system for the Project.
Not only are we concerned about the delay and the effect this will have on the sewer rectification works
to Pier 4, but we are also concerned that if you delay issuing us instructions defining the scope of
rectification works for the remaining piers, in the same manner as for Pier 4, then not only will this
further prolong the rectification works generally, but we run the risk that the CIPP materials for Piers 1
to 3 that have been ordered through ApplusVelosi, will become scrap given their limited shelf life.
Yours faithfully,
