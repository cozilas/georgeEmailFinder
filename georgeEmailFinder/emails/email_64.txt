ANNEX A
DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT
Background
The relocation of Hotel windows was initially proposed and agreed by ADAC as a way forward to simplify
and de-link the interface between the glass window and stone cladding that would satisfy recent
comments from ADAC’s new Fire and Safety Consultant ‘ProFire’; although all previous related Shop
Drawings were thoroughly reviewed and approved by the Employer’s Design Consultant as well as its
Fire and Safety Consultant. It is to be noted that ‘ProFire’ has advised, via email dated 23 December
2019, that the previous Employer’s Design and Fire Consultant had “improperly reviewed and misscoded the drawings”.
Therefore, on 11 December 2019, we had a meeting with between our respective teams (TCAJV and
CMA) as well as the Employer (ADAC) at which we were requested to issue the related revised sketches
via an RFI to expedite the return approval (this was advised via email dated 11 December 2019).
RFI/0401/17654
We complied and on 15 December 2019, we raised RFI/0401/17654 associated with the ‘Window Shift
location at Hotel Courtyard Façade’ providing you with a series of sketches all “as discussed and agreed
with ADAC”, requesting your approval of the same.
We requested a response by 26 December 2019. You failed to reply until 8 January 2020. Nevertheless,
we were advised by the Employer’s Design Consultant that this was a design change from IFC and is
rejected and with that in mind, informed the Employer therein, “to reject this proposal accordingly.” The

Employer on the other hand, advised it had no objection to our proposal, and directed us to ensure all
approvals were obtained from the relevant reviewers (Employer’s Design Consultant and HOE) for the
system performance.
We do note however that the Employer’s Fire and Life Safety Consultant (Profire) previously advised you
that an advance copy of the “updated drawings for windows are verified and found acceptable” (as per
their e-mail dated 24 December 2019, at 11:35 AM) and you in turn advised us that “window drawings
are cleared” as per their e-mail to you also dated 24 December 2019, but timed at 12:05 PM).
SDS/0401/A/4840 Rev. 00
As instructed via the above response to RFI/0401/17654, we complied with the requests and on 19
January 2020, submitted the new Shop Drawing No. 401-JV-A-03-L_-5.32-DWL-SD-001 Rev. 00 ‘Fire
Rated Window Details and Hotel Courtyard Façade’ under cover of Shop Drawing Submittal No.
SDS/0401/A/4840 Rev. 00, which you subsequently responded to on 26 February 2020 classifying it
Status Code 3 (refer Table 2):

Notwithstanding the delayed response, you advised you would follow the coding of the Employer’s Fire
and Life Safety Consultant (Profire); which had been returned classified as Status Code 3. However, it is
worth noting that no comments were in fact provided either on the Transmittal or the Shop Drawing
[subject to the SDS/0401/A/4840 Rev 00 response issued on 26 February 2020]. This was recorded in an
exchange of e-mails between our respective Document Control Departments at the time (26 February
2020). We were surprised by their rejection given their previous acceptance of the window sketch
drawings [see above].
SDS/0401/A/4840 Rev. 01
On 4 March 2020, we submitted Shop Drawing Submittal No. SDS/0401/A/4840 Rev. 01, for approval of
Shop Drawing No. 401-JV-A-03-L_-5.32-DWL-SD-001 Rev. 01 ‘Fire Rated Window Details and Hotel
Courtyard Façade’ which you replied to on 25 March 2020 again classifying it Status Code 3 (refer Table
3); the Rev. 01 Shop Drawing attached thereto containing multiple unreasonable Status Code 3
comments.

Summary
Article 1.3 of Specification Section 013300 ‘Submittal Procedures’ governs the processing time by which

Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4 shows that you have consistently failed to respond to SDS/0401/A/4840
Rev. 00, Rev. 01 and Rev. 00 within the 21, 14 and 7 calendar day review periods expressly stipulated the
Contract:
•
Table 2 shows that you exceeded the contract review period by 17 calendar days;
•
Table 3 shows that you exceeded the contract review period by 7 calendar days; and
•
Table 4 shows that you are currently exceeding the contract review period by 8 calendar days.
Our entitlement to an extension of time and to recover the associated costs resulting from this act of
prevention on your part and / or the part of the Employer’s Personnel/Consultants, will apply
irrespective of any alleged failure on our part [which is denied], to transmit submittals to you in a timely
manner.
Yours faithfully,
