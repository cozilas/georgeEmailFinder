Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer's Instruction Nr.89 of reference 1) issued pursuant to General Condition ("GC")
13.1.1 of Volume 3 of the Contract, the Contractor encloses herewith full particulars of its actual design
costs related to the optimization of the Passageways' Width.

The relevant Fee Change Notice (FCN) 071 includes payment requests from Atkins on account of other
design changes as well which are not related to the Engineer's Instruction Nr. 89 and hence no reference
has been made herein. Those shall be addressed by the Contractor under a separate cover in due
course.

As a direct consequence of this instruction to vary the works, the Contractor instructed Atkins to
perform additional work and has received a notice for additional payment by Atkins on account of the
additional design works entailed. Those can be summarized as per the following table:

Table 1) FCN 071 (Subway Width Reduction): Amounts claimed by Atkins, AL YSJ JV Determination for
the same and payments to date

As detailed herein, the Contractor estimates that QAR 8,510,410.87 is a fair and reasonable
compensation to Atkins against the originally claimed value of QAR 13,860,192.96 which was, at the
Contractor's opinion, overstated both in terms of the applicable staff rates and the respective time
spent.

The Contractor has enclosed as attachment 1) to this letter its determinat ion of FCN 071 .

Whilst noting that none of its aforementioned determination amounts have been agreed with Atkins as
full and sole compensation with the entire balance being the subject of an ongoing dispute, the
Contractor has nevertheless paid the amount of QAR 7,702,680.74 already, for which proof of payment
in the form of electronic payment (wire transfer) documents has been enclosed as attachment 2).

It is finally noted that the remaining MEP design works in relation to the said FCN have been de-scoped
from Atkins and currently being undertaken by Worley Parsons and as such, the Contractor reserves its
rights to bring forward evidence of its future payments for the same.

In any event, and whilst noting that the FCN 071 determination amount may be subject to further
change, the Contractor kindly requests the Employer to proceed with an interim, on-account payment of
its current determination value plus 12% for profits and overheads , in the net amount of QAR
8,627,002.43.

Such payment would be of invaluable assistance to the continued financing of the Project. Yours
faithfully,
Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to letter 1) whereby the Engineer issued an instruction pursuant to Sub-Clause
13.1.1 of the General Conditions of Contract in relation to the Optimisation for the Reduction in
Passageways' Width.

Upon receipt of the Engineer's instruction, the Contractor duly instructed its Design Consultant Hyder to
proceed with the incorporation thereof in the design and has received the enclosed Consultant's
Proposal for the Adjustment of the Fee with supporting particulars of the related additional design costs.

In accordance with the provisions of Sub-Clause 1.18 [Limitations on Consultant's Entitlements and
Claims] of the Design Consultant's Agreement,

"In the event the Consultant shall have any Claim or a right to any Entitlement relating to the same
issue, event or circumstance forming the basis of a Claim or right to an Entitlement of the Client under
the Main Contract which is capable of being passed through to the Consultant under the Agreement, the
Entitlement granted to the Consultant under this Clause shall not, under any circumstances, exceed an
Entitlement granted to the Client under the Main Contract in relation to the same issue, event or
circumstance forming the basis the Entitlement. "

Further to the above, the Engineer is hereby kindly requested to review the Design Consultant's
Proposal for the Adjustment of the Fee and to proceed in accordance with Sub-Clause 13.6 [Valuations
of Variations] and agree or determine adjustments to the Contract Price and the Schedule of Payments
pursuant to Sub-Clause
3.5 (Determinations).

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarificat ion.
Dear Sir,
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 13.2.1, the Engineer's Assistant directs the Contractor to submit a quotation,
providing a detailed breakdown of cost savings for which the Contractor would carry out the proposed
Variation. The quotation is to be based upon the following Engineer's Instruction, which is currently
under review for process and issue to the Contractor .

Details of the Instruction under review are:

""The Employers Requirements Volume 6 Section 11, Design Specifications Sub-Clause 4.6.25 b)
currently state that:

"Based on these calculations, the minimum clear width of such passageways , whether elevated or
underground, shall be no less than 10 m. This does not include areas of low mobility near to vertical
surfaces such as walls, railings or balustrades. For these areas, an additional width of 0.25 m must be
deducted per surface from the overall width to arrive at the absolute clear width for the passageway."

Volume 6 Section 11, Design Specifications Sub-Clause 4.6.25 b) is now amended:
To reflect an optimization outcome where the minimum clear width of passageways whether elevated
or underground is reduced to 6.80 metres. (excluding event stations)

The potential minimum width allowable at each station is as shown in Attachment A, Summary
Presentation of Required Passageway Widths, attached to this Instruction. Contractor is to note that:

•

This does not include for finishes which should be assumed as +1.0m

•

Width of passageway is the clear width between the two (2) clad facades of the passageway

•
Width of walkway is the usable width of the walkway between the two (2) travellators or the
travellators and the wall - depending upon layout.

Stations, where the minimum width has already been agreed with Other parties or where design and
construction may have advanced to the stage where reverting minimum width is no longer feasible,
shall be considered on a case by case basis.

Contractor is instructed to implement the requirements to ensure the best possible optimization in
design and installation is carried out.""

In support of the above detail, the Engineer's Assistant also includes the document referenced as
Attachment A Key Plans for Width of Passageways along with a specific Table as extracted from
Attachment A
The Engineer's Assistant requires Contractor to review the above details, ensure that the appropriate
requirements are being implemented into current design outcomes and to submit the detailed cost
savings breakdown within fourteen (14) days of this direction.

Yours faithfully,
