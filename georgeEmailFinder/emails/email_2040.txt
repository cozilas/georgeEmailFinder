Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer’s Assistant’s letter of reference 1), the Contractor notes that in accordance with
Subclause 14.3.2 of the General Conditions of Contract the Contractor is required to enclose a number
of documents, as applicable, to its Statement.

In relation to the provision of evidence of payments to Subcontractors, Subclause 14.3.2 further
confines the requirement to provide such information to where it is required for the assessment of a
payment and preparation of an Interim Payment Certificate.

The Contractor has therefore duly provided all payment evidence whenever applicable and required for
the assessment of a specific pay item. To mention but one example, under reference 5) evidence of
payments to Subcontractors was enclosed to the Contractor’s request for an on-account payment
against additional design costs incurred in relation to an Engineer’s Instructions.

Under letter reference 1) the Engineer’s Assistant has not specified against which pay items he considers
the requirement to provide evidence of payments to Subcontractors to be applicable and required for

its assessment of the Statement. The Contractor is therefore unaware of any noncompliance with
Subclause 14.3.2 and kindly requests further clarification.

Yours faithfully,
