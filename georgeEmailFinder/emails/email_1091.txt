Subject: Reply- Variation for Design Calculations
Dear Sir,
We acknowledge receipt of your letter referenced in (6} above regarding the aforementioned subject,
However, we reiterate on our position stated in our previous letter under reference (5) that, it is your
contractual obligation to provide and get approval of all required Structural Calculations for items under
your package that conforms and meet all requirements of the Project specifications under the
Subcontract.
Although we are agree with your statement that there is no requirement for LMI to provide the
Professional Indemnity insurance for this scope of works, however it is your misuse and
misinterpretation of the word "Design Calculations" instead of mentioning "Structural Calculations" in
this context. Â·
Therefore we reject your notification for a variation cost of structural calculations since it is your
contractual obligation to do so.
Moreover, please be advised to refrain from raising such unfounded notification in future.
This is for your utmost attention and immediate action.
Yours faithfully,
