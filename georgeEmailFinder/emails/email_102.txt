Dear Sir,
We write in response to your letter referenced (1), (2) and (4) above, pertaining to the aforementioned
subject.
Following initial review of your submitted documentation, we note that, you did not follow the
guidelines
sent to you through several letters and e-mails.
If you deem yourself entitled to 'Prolongation Costs' for any period beyond March 2015

accordingly.
You are reminded of your obligation to adhere Clauses 27.1 (Subcontractor's Claims) and
