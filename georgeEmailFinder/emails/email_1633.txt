Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to the Attachment 1 to the Engineer's Instruction (E.I.) no.87 regarding changes in
the design of the entrance adjacent to Al Shamouk tower at Al Sadd Station received under letter
reference 1).

The Contractor analyzed the Attachment 1 therewith and ascertained that the information provided is
illegible, therefore an informal request was sent (email from Ms.Artemis Anninou to Mr. James J.
Quinlan dated 15 November 2015) to the Engineer's Assistant.

Further to the above, the Contractor hereby kindly requests the Engineer's Assistant to provide legible
drawings and the corresponding CAD drawings for the Amended Pedestrian Connection at YWST020 (Al
Sadd Station). Upon receipt thereof, the Contractor will proceed with the implementation of E.I no.87 in
the design.

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.
Yours faithfully,
