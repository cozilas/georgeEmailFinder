Subject: Reply letter â€“ Notification of Delay to Subcontract Works due to the recently introduced Access
Restrictions
Dear Sir,
We acknowledge receipt of your letter referenced in (3) above regarding the aforementioned subject
and we hereby inform you the following.

We reject your assertion that the recently introduced access restrictions are hampering your progress of
works. Please be advised that you were properly notified about the closure of the south ramp at the
east of the building in a timely manner as evidenced by our enclosed email sent to you on 19th April
2018 referenced in (4) above. Such notification was to enable you to plan your works and put in place
necessary precautions to avoid any access problem.
In this regard, you were given ample time to respond accordingly highlighting your concerns to our
Construction/Logistics team; hence as per our record, we received none of such response or comments
from any of your site team.
Moreover, as an experienced subcontractor and as per the Subcontract Clause 10.1.3 [Right of Access to
the Site] and the Clauses under 12.12 [Other Contractors and Other Subcontractors], you should have
anticipated some of the difficulties encountered in this challenging project with respect to coordinating
your works and should have allowed flexibility in the programme by having in place mitigation
strategies. Therefore, we trust that you have the capacity to take all measures required to mitigate all
delays and complete the works on time.
Notwithstanding the above, please be informed that as per the Subcontract Agreement, there is no
ground to attribute delays related to this matter, if the delays are not critical and are not affecting the
critical path of the works related to the location. Therefore, we reject your assertion to claim for
Extension of Subcontract Time for Completion with additional cost.
Yours faithfully,
