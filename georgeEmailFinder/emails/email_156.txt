Subject:Post SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0210
Unreasonable Code 3 comments issued in reply to Shop Drawing No: 401-EF-M-02-34-5.32B-AC-SD-001
Rev 04 & Rev. 05 and RFI/0401/17425 – Failure to Resolve Design issues – Mechanical HVAC Ductwork
to Hotel Building L3.4
Dear Sirs,
We refer to your letter ref: (1) following issuance of our E-Notice No. 0210 (ref: 2) in which you allege
that we are responsible for overcoming the design issues described in (ref: 2) due to a purported “lack of
coordination [on our part] between various trades and services”. You also infer that we are somehow
liable for deficiencies in “Code compliance requirements”.
For the reasons comprehensively set out in our letter ref: (2) we disagree entirely. We therefore take
this further opportunity in reminding you of the following salient evidence of fact:
During a Briefing Pack (BP) 10 design development meeting held on or around end January / early
February 2018, it was found that the existing arrangement of the HVAC ductwork to the Hotel Building
L3.4 had been poorly designed / poorly coordinated by the Employer’s Design Consultant (i.e. in and
between the HVAC and Architectural Design Drawings), such that if constructed, the ductwork would
clash with the architectural cladding located immediately above. Additionally, there were also issues
concerning the orientation of light fixtures.
In an e-mail dated 11 February 2018 [1.56 pm] we advised you as follows (refer to Figure 1):
Figure 1
In a further e-mail dated 20 February 2018 [4:10 pm] we wrote as follows (refer to Figure 2):
Figure 2
The snapshots referenced above and included in our e-mail dated 20 February 2018 conveys the
clashing of the ductwork as well as the means by which it could be overcome (Figure 3):
Figure 3
Meanwhile, during the BP10 design development meeting held on 4 February 2018, a sketch layout
indicating the agreement of the parties of the side by side arrangement of the HVAC ductwork was
tabled (refer to Figure 4 below). In addition to addressing the clashing of the ductwork, this sketch also
took cognisance of accessibility issues and the resolution of issues with the lighting fixtures.
Figure 4
However, although all other parties had signed this sketch as agreed, whether by reason of oversight or
some other reason that remains unclear, the Employer’s Design Consultant [KPF] had not signed it.
On 5 December 2018 we issued Shop Drawing Submittal No. SDS/0401/M/0957 Rev. 05 requesting your
approval of Shop Drawing No: 401-EF-M-02-34-5.32B-AC-SD-001 Rev 04, relating to the ‘Mechanical
Duct Layout L3.4 (Hotel/Offices/Lounges Level) Sector 5.32B. Unfortunately however, on 2 January

2019, we received a Status Code 3 response to SDS/0401/M/0957-05 together with a series of
comments annotated upon Shop Drawing No: 401-EF-M-02-34-5.32B-AC-SD-001 Rev 04. These include
amongst other things, the following comments in relation to the ductwork (Figure 5 refers).
Figure 5 – Status Code 3 Comments
Shop Drawing No: 401-EF-M-02-34-5.32B-AC-SD-001-Rev 04
These comments – particularly in relation to the ductwork blocking the walkway and means of egress
shall not be blocked – demonstrate that that the Employer’s Design Consultant had either overlooked or
chose to ignore what was previously discussed and agreed at the Briefing Pack 10 design meetings.
This caused us to raise RFI/0401/17425-00 (entitled ‘Comment on Shop Drawing – Ductwork Route at
Hotel Building L3.4’), on 3 September 2019, which besides enclosing a series of attachments in support
of the above, asked you / the Employer’s Design Consultant to confirm the following:
1.
Confirm acceptance to the current duct routing as shown on the shop drawing; and
2.
Confirm acceptance to shift the 5 lighting fixtures as marked on attached sketch.
We requested a response to RFI/0401/17425-00 by 8 September 2019. However you failed to reply until
21 October 2019. Unfortunately, rather than the Employer’s Design Consultant [KPF] address what was
being requested, KPF’s response stated inter alia the following:
•
“We have given our comments at ADAC's request to assist the project but have no responsibility
for the measures the JV adopt to rectify their defects”
•
“The changes proposed by the Contractor shall have no increased cost or programme impact to
the client”
•
“CMA have assumed design responsibility for changes to the ducting on the roof without getting
technical input from the design team.
•
“… we cannot support the change as directed by CMA. We would recommend that ADAC reject
this change.”
We made our thoughts known on these comments in our letter (ref: 2) addressing each one by way of a
Scott schedule per Table 2 thereto, and therefore for brevity will not repeat the content here. We will
however, reiterate that it is clear that KPF is aware of the numerous discussions, meetings and resultant
agreements mentioned above to resolve these issues, which they consider have taken place without
their direct involvement. Thus, it is evident that KPF is unwilling to take ownership and address this
matter, which in its view, you [the Engineer] and ADAC, have assumed responsibility for.
Further to which, on 12 January 2020, we submitted SDS/0401/M/0957-06 requesting approval of Shop
Drawing No: 401-EF-M-02-34-5.32B-AC-SD-001 Rev 05, which was returned on 23 January 2020,
classified Status Code 3 was accompanied by a series of comments annotated thereupon. These include
amongst other things, the following comments in relation to the ductwork (Figure 6 refers).
Figure 6 – Further Status Code 3 Comments
Shop Drawing No: 401-EF-M-02-34-5.32B-AC-SD-001-Rev 05
As noted in letter ref: (2), we are disappointed that the Employer’s Design Consultant has maintained its
position as per its previous responses and ignored the previous agreement that was reached in early
February 2018. This issue is not being resolved and is delaying us; hence our E-Notice No. 0210.
Meanwhile, in an e-mail dated 26 January 2020 [08:48 AM] titled ‘SDS/0401/M/0957-06’, we wrote to
advise you that: “The ... drawing is again rejected by KPF/ARUP with comments claiming that the
Contractor’s proposal in RFI-17425 was rejected by ARUP. In fact ARUP didn’t reject the proposal they
only recommended that ADAC rejects it (see below excerpt from ARUP’s response).” We also stated:
“TCA-JV are working closely with the CMA to address all the concerns raised by ADAC in the RFI
response; the items related to the scope of the drawing were addressed adequately prior resubmitting
the drawing which are the location of the grease trap and the travel distance (See attached emails).

In light of the above, we kindly request ADAC to direct the Design Consultant to recode the drawing.”
However, in your response dated 13 February 2020 [7:29 PM] you wrote to advise inter alia:
“1.
We discussed with ProFire regarding the egress path at L3.4 Hotel Roof and they informed that
since the current scenario it is single sided common path egress allowable distance shall be not more
than 15m as per NFPA. However, if an alternative route can be provide by catwalk to the other side or
ladder to the lower level balcony, the travel distance required is relaxed to 60m. Please check the
possibility of providing alternative exit path as shown in the snip below and issue a proposal to close the
issue.”
We replied on 17 February 2020 [5:53 PM] and stated amongst other things that:
“As discussed, the shop drawing is following the agreed solution during the BP and the signed sketch for
the same.
Your below proposal to add a ladder to resolve item 1 constitutes a variation to the Contractor’s scope
of work and requires an Engineer’s instruction to be implemented.”
Our position remains unchanged; both in terms of the Employer’s Design Consultant failure to take
ownership and address the on-going design problem and design coordination issue which we have
comprehensively set out in our E-Notice No. 0210 and summarised above; and your joint failure in
recognising that any changes to the existing IFC design constitutes a variation and requires an Engineer’s
Instruction for us to proceed with incorporating any change [alternative exit path] into the Works. Both
you and the Employer’s Design Consultant fail to recognise and accept that this is not a design and build
contract; we are not responsible for the design, and as such we are not responsible for overcoming
design coordination issues nor are we responsible for overcoming code complaint issues; neither are we
responsible for providing proposals “to close the issue.” These responsibilities rest firmly with the
Employer’s Design Consultant not us. Hence as this is a design problem, it cannot be construed as being
due to any failure on our part to coordinate between trades and services.
At the risk of being repetitive, this issue is a design problem and design coordination problem and we
therefore reiterate that, as noted in our e-mail dated 26 January 2018, you approach the Employer to
direct the Design Consultant to recode Shop Drawing No: 401-EF-M-02-34-5.32B-AC-SD-001 Rev 05 or in
the alternative, to provide a properly coordinated code compliant design solution. That is his role.
Meanwhile, we continue to maintain all our rights under the provision of Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event described in letter ref: (2).
Yours faithfully,
