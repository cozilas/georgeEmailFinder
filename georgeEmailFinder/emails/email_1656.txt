Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer’s Instruction Nr.53 of reference 2) allegedly issued pursuant to General
Condition (“GC”) 3.3.1 of Volume 3 of the Contract, the Contractor encloses herewith full particulars of
its actual design costs related to the amendment of the scope of works of the Project.

As a direct consequence of this instruction to vary the works, the Contractor instructed Atkins to
perform additional work and has received a notice for additional payment by Atkins on account of the
additional design works entailed. Those can be summarized as per the following table:

FCN 23 Amount claimed by Atkins
(QAR) ALYSJ JV Determination
(QAR) Amount paid to date
(QAR)
Atkins Lead Design

1,070,500.00

701,444.00

Atkins MEP Design

194,609.00

Atkins Total

896,053.00

896,053.00

Table 1) FCN 23: Amounts claimed by Atkins, ALYSJ JV Determination for the same and payments to date

As detailed herein, the Contractor estimates that QAR 896,053.00 is a fair and reasonable compensation
to Atkins against the originally claimed value of QAR 896,053.00 which was, at the Contractor’s opinion,
overstated both in terms of the applicable staff rates and the respective time spent.

The Contractor has enclosed as attachment 1) to this letter its determination of FCN 23.

Whilst noting that none of its aforementioned determination amounts have been agreed with Atkins as
full and sole compensation with the entire balance being the subject of an ongoing dispute, the
Contractor has nevertheless paid the amount of QAR 896,053.00 already, for which, proof of payment in
the form of electronic payment (wire transfer) documents has been enclosed as attachment 2).

In any event, and whilst noting that the FCN 23 determination amount may be subject to further change,
the Contractor kindly requests the Employer to proceed with an interim, on-account payment of its
actual design costs incurred plus 12% for profits and overheads, in the net amount of QAR 1,003,579.36.

Such payment would be of invaluable assistance to the continued financing of the Project.

Yours faithfully,
