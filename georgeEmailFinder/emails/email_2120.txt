Dear Sir,
We refer to MOOS-LBE-COM-LTR-01092 which specifically required the Contractor to submit under Subclause 13.2.1 detailed quotations and time Impacts regarding Tunnel Finishes and Walkways. The
Contractor has failed to submit the required information which was due on 30 July 2015 and is now late.

The Engineer's Assistant reminds the Contractor that the information is due and requests the attached
Cost Eslimate Matrix Template be used in supplying the required information. Under Sub-C lause
13.2.2 the contractor must submit information clearly showing Option B's calculations and
documentation as calculated in the Accepted Contract Amount.
Yours faithfully,
