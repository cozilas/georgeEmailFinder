Subject Removal and Replacement of the Subcontractors Representative
Dear Sir;
We refer to our letter ref {2) dated 25th Sept 2017 which is written as a response to your letter Ref {1)
dated 13th Sept

2017 regarding removal and replacement of the Subcontractors representative and update its content
with the
reference to your allegations with the followings;
We once again would like to repeat that our disagreement to your allegations had been discussed in the
principle meeting held on 23rd Aug 2017 and agreed by your principles to provide necessary proofs,
justifications, substantiation for all those allegations. However we have not seen any detail, reference
and/or any project criteria being the ground of your following allegations except some email
correspondences for the first item.
Obstructive actions/behaviors that hinders the Progress of the Contract Works The list of Project
Activities/Objectives hindered due to such actions/behaviors The list of Contractor's instructions that
the Subcontractor has shown excessive reluctance Particular cases and its consequences where the
Subcontractor has failed to comply with its contractual obligations as a result of the above
The cases in those emails have been properly responded within the content of our letter dated 25th Sep
2017 and the subjects are all timely acted and resolved without causing any disturbance to site
progresses. On the other hand we pursue our contractual rights for all those cases where we incur
additional costs and loses through our variation submissions and kindly request your assistance for the
early determination with sufficient compensation.
In conclusion once again; Day to day email communications are utilised as obstructive behaviour
whereas it is the requirement of Sub-Contract Clause 12.11.3 {Cooperation) to report any defects or
non-conformities to the Contractor in good and sufficient time to enable the Contractor to procure the
rectification of such works without causing any delay or disruption to the Subcontractor.
12.11.2 If any part or parts of the Subcontract Works are dependent for their support or execution upon
work being carried out by any Other Contractors or Other Subcontractors, the Subcontractor shall either
monitor the carrying out of such work or inspect such work and report any defects or non-conformities
to the Contractor v in good and sufficient time to enable the Contractor to procure the rectification of
such works without causing disruption to the subcontractor. Those communications are escalated to a
level of dispute creating confusion in contractual, commercial and technical issues rather than proper
regard to the Sub-Contract provoking the communicators Contractor's improper representations in
those communication not using reasonable endeavors such as to convene formal meetings for amicable
resolutions for such conflicts in accordance with SubContract Clause 10.2 (Contractor's Personnel)
10.2 Contractor's Personnel: The Contractor shall use reasonable endeavors to ensure that the
Employer's
Personnel, the Contractor's Personnel, the Consultants, Other Contractors and Other Subcontractors on
the Site:
a) cooperate with the Subcontractor under clause 12.11 (Cooperation); and
b) take actions similar to those which the Subcontractor is required to take under clauses 12.14.3(a) to
12.14.3(c), and under clause 12.24 (Protection of the Environment).
The Subcontractor has not objected to any of Contractor's instruction however have drawn the
Contractor's attention to the ambiguities and/or discrepancies that might jeopardize the performance of
the Subcontractor that eventually would have adverse effect on the project.
The Subcontractor do not accept to bear the consequences of such inappropriate and inconvenient
decisions of any of Contractor's Personal and/or Representatives instructing the Subcontractor to
undertake the obligations of other subcontractor involved in the Project enforced to carry out works out
of its scope defined under Sub-Contract. Therefore the Subcontractor record Contractor's breach of
SubContract Clause 9.20.1
9.20.1 Any amendments to the terms and conditions of the Subcontract shall only be effective if in
writing

and signed by a duly authorized representative of each Party. Any amendments to the scope of the
Subcontract
Works shall be subject to the provisions of clause 20 (Variations and Adjustments).
Subcontractor Representative had only met with the Employer in meetings at where Contractor
requested his attendance together with Contractor Representatives. He has never met the Employer
bypassing the Contractor.
Once again the above is not the position of Anel's representative but its Anel's position itself and hold
the Contractor
culpable for all such inappropriate and inconvenient decisions, its failure to comply with the Subcontract
Clause 9.20.1
and Clause 10.2 (Contractor's Personnel) . The Subcontractor reserves its rights for all cost and losses
that might arise
due to its consequences in accordance with Sub-Contract Clauses 9.10.4, Clause 16.5 (Extension of
Subcontract Time
for Completion), Clause 21.2 (Adjustment to the Subcontract Price, Clause 24.3.1, Item (g) (Contractor's
Risks), Clause
27.1 (Subcontractor's Claim)
We hereby would draw your attention and record that our clarifications have not been responded by
your side till date
therefore your allegation are deemed to be totally refuted and closed.
Yours faithfully,
