Subject: Over-Pumping from Site West Pond to ADM Network
Dear Sir,
By way of correspondence reference {1) above, we sought permission to discharge the water
used in testing and commissioning of the LB2 fire pumps from manhole number MH-42 into the
MTL storm water network for a period of two weeks. By way of letter reference {2) we received
your no objection certificate.
The MTL storm water network terminates downstream at the Site West Pond. ADAC requires that
this pond be kept empt/, however, as there is no outlet ADAC has directed that any water in the
pond be over-pumped into the ADM storm water network. Notwithstanding that we contend this
is not our responsibility under the Contract,2 on a without prejudice basis we have agreed to
carry out over-pumping on this occasion, and we have made the necessary arrangements with
TRANSMAK3 for the two week period during which we shall be carrying out the testing and
commissioning ofthe LB2 fire pumps.
Upon completion of the testing and commissioning of LB-2 fire pumps we will be shutting the
system down. However, we understand that ADAC's Fire Life Safety team, in preparation for Civil
Defense inspections, will soon thereafter require the system to be switched into auto-mode for a
period that is at present unknown and which may extend up to site handover in October 2019.
Consequently, from time-to-time, water will be discharged from the fire pumps into the MTL
storm water network and ultimately into the Site West Pond. We draw your and ADAC's attention
to this and request that ADAC make its own arrangements for over-pumping this discharge water
from the pond into the ADM storm water network.
Alternatively, should ADAC require us to engage with TRANSMAK and continue the overpumping, we
request you to formally instruct us pursuant to Clause 20.l.l(b} to submit a cost
proposal4 for this varied works.
Yours faithfully
