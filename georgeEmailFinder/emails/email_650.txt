Subject:Re: Water Spill on top of grouted stone flooring tiles- CP Level 3.0

Dear Sir/Madam,
We are in receipt of your letter referenced (1) wherein you have informed us about the incident
showing the water flood on grouted stone flooring tiles at CP Level 3.0. After reviewing the evidence
submitted with your letter we note that the stone as shown in the pictures and video is not protected
properly. As per your Subcontract obligations, you failed to take all appropriate actions to protect your
works using the blue sheets under the plywood.
Furthermore, you are reminded of your obligations under Subcontract Clauses 15.6.2 [Passing of risk
and title], 24.2.1 and 24.2.2 [Subcontractor’s Care of the Subcontract Works] to protect your works until
ownership transfers to the Employer upon Taking over Certificate in accordance with Subcontract Clause
18 [Contractor’s Taking Over].
This is for your information and further action.
Yours faithfully,
