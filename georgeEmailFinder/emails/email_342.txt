Subject:Post SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0140
Pending Installation of Duress Alarms to Screening Room and X-Ray Machines / Delays to
Completion of HBSS and PBSS Installations to L0.0 and L1.0 due to Delayed Completion of Shell and Core
Works by Employer’s Other Contractor
Dear Sir
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and/or disruption to the Works and seek your swift resolution of the same.

Overview
The matters described in Annex A concern delays to completion of HBSS and PBBS installations due to
act(s) of prevention on the part of the Employer and / or the Employer’s Other Contractor.
Potential Impact
Delays and disruption due to the events and circumstances outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
likely to impact on achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within seven (7) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
On 15 July 2019, we raised RFI/0401/17302 Rev. 00 [dated 13 July 2019], together with a series of
schedules and marked up Shop Drawings, plus a photo, requesting further clarification from you as to
whether the duress alarms are to be free issued for the following equipment and areas / levels:
1.
The Hold Baggage Screening System (HBSS) to L3A Screening Room to Level L0.0 (the relevant
extracts of the related schedule and Shop Drawing are shown in Figure 1 and 2 below); and
Figure 1
Figure 2
2.
The X-Ray Machines in the Shell and Core Areas to Level L0.0 and Level L1.0; particularly given
that at the time of raising RFI/0401/17302 Rev. 00, the X-Ray Machines are located in rooms that are
designated as ‘shell and core’ fitted out by the Employer’s Other Contractor and had not been
completed and consequently the X-Ray Machines were unable to be installed (the relevant extracts of
the related schedule and Shop Drawing shown in Figure 3 and 4 refers).

Figure 4
We requested a reply to RFI/0401/17302 by 22 July 2019. However, you failed to do so until circa three
weeks later, on 14 August 2019. In short, the response from the Employer’s Design Consultant
confirmed that that the “Duress Alarms buttons for future provisions … are to be free issued to the
Client” but with specific reference to the Shell and Core areas, the Consultant advised that “the
machines will be installed as soon as the shell & core areas are ready ... [and] …Contractor to install the
duress buttons after completing the installation of the machines in the shell & core areas.”
In our view this represents an acknowledgment that:
1.
Our ability to complete our works is dependent on completion of the shell and core areas; and
2.
The shell and core areas are incomplete.
Unfortunately this has remained the case since the response to RFI/0401/17302 was returned, and at
the date of preparing this Notice, i.e. 9 September 2019, the shell and core areas to the above noted
areas and levels to be fitted out by the Employer’s Other Contractor have not been completed. As a
direct consequence of which, we have been prevented from completing the installation of free issue

duress buttons to Levels L0.0 and L1.0; and similarly prevented from completing the HBSS and PBSS
equipment installations and related works to the levels and sectors shown in Figure 1 and 3 above.
We therefore take this opportunity advising you of the specific items of specialist equipment and the
rooms affected, evident from the following schedules provided in Figure 5 and 6 below:
Figure 5
Figure 6
Moreover, the delayed completion of the shell and core areas and the impact on our Works and the
works of our specialist subcontractors has been continuing for some considerable time; evidenced by
the following letters from the specialist PBSS subcontractor, Smiths Detection [copies attached]:
1.
Letter dated 10 June 2019, reference MTB-SMD-TCAJV-L-0668 (ref: 1); and
2.
Letter dated 10 June 2019, reference MTB-SMD-TCAJV-L-0669 (ref: 2).
It is because of the delays to completion of our works and those of our subcontractor(s), that we are
compelled to raise this E-Notice No. 0140, notifying you that delayed completion of core and shell fit out
works by the Employer’s Other Contractor(s) and the impact this continues to have on the HBSS / PBSS
works, will invariably delay testing and commissioning and impacting our ability to achieve Milestone
MS09B, and may prevent us from achieving Substantial Completion (Milestone MS09C).
Yours faithfully,
