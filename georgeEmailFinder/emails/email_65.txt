Subject: Notice of Delay for Long Overdue Code-3 Shop Drawings Re-Submission for Typical layout Plans,
SS Skirting (Gate House Code E & F)
Dear Sir,
Despite our assistance to AIG to develop proper shop drawings, as acknowledged by your letter
MFAD/TCA/JA/393/2016 30 October 2016, AIG have failed to respond. The Gate House skirting drawings
are still under Code 3 since 07 October 2016. We previously recorded our concerns regarding delays in
shop drawing submittals in our letter ref. MTB/TCA/AIG/L/000422 date 16 October 2016.
Moreover, it is our experience that AIG shop drawings are frequently of poor quality. The standard of
drawing is far from best practice as required by Clause 12.1.6 (k) of the Sub-Contractor contract
conditions
and the quality assurance in 12.15. The repeatedly poor quality negatively impacts the project program .
Any costs, losses and/or expenses incurred by TCA-JV and/or other Subcontractors in connection with
your delays to the above or the negative impact(s) that may result from this delay shall be your sole
responsibility for both cost and time.
Failure to fulfill your contractual obligations under the Subcontract shall be recovered from your
account
in accordance with the Subcontract Terms and Conditions. In case of further non-performance, we will
withhold payments for this purpose.
Yours faithfully,
