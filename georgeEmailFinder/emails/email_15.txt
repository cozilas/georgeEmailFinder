Subject:Charges for Manpower
Dear Sir,
In relation to the above-mentioned letters ref: (1 and 2) which have been sent to you regarding the nonattendance of your manpower, this is to inform you that the fluctuation of the manpower provided by
you continues to date, despite our numerous warnings to keep the manpower number constant.

Specifically, as discussed in our abovementioned letters, the number of your workers are decreasing and
fluctuating daily and are not being kept constant. This is creating a significant disruption to our works
and negatively affects our site productivity resulting to costs impacts.
Moreover, it has come to our attention that you may be providing, in some instances, workers who are
not registered with ADMC or with DEWA and are using another personâ€™s gate pass to enter the site. This
not only unacceptable, but taking into consideration the strict rules imposed on site, any unauthorized
access to the DEWA site is strictly prohibited. Consequently, if this is found to be truthful then, serious
penalties may be imposed upon you as well as, termination of your services.
In view of the above, you are requested to ensure that appropriate steps are being, in order to avoid the
reoccurrence of such events in the future. Failure to comply with the above, may lead to lead to your
dismissal from our Project Site.
Yours faithfully,
