Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer’s direction under Sub-clause 13.2.1 of the General Conditions of Contract of
reference 1) received on the 11th of June 2017 the Contractor requests clarification concerning the
scope of works of this Variation.

In the ERS of reference 2) the Engineer’s Assistant has commented the Contractor’s report of reference
3) in relation to the future use of the tunnel extension as follows:
The report makes reference to the track that will be non-operational in phase 1. The future operator will
make full use of all available track for strategic stabling of maintenance trains and shunting movements,
so please amend the report. If the Contractor is stating that track is not going to be used for phase 1,
then the question will be made as to why the track is being provided.

The intended use of the tunnel extension under phase 1, especially if it is to be used for stabling
purposes, has a major impact on the design requirements of this section. The Contractor is therefore
requesting clarification as to the intended use for phase 1 operation.

Furthermore the Contractor wishes to advise the Engineer that it will submit a quotation when the price
and any possible delay implications have been fully assessed. However, this cannot be provided within
the 14 days specified as there are 3rd party inputs (not least from an engineering aspect) that are not as
yet available.

The Contractor therefore confirms its intention to provide a preliminary price by the 6 June 2017, and
trusts this meets with the Engineer’s approval.

Yours faithfully,
