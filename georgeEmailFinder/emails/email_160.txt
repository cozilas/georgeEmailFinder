Subject Delay Notice- Failure to Complete Airport Pulse Solution
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence (1) above, for which the Contractor's response is still
awaited. As you are aware, the requirement for the Airport Pulse System Solution provided by the
AOS Subcontractor to comply with the Resource Management System Specification (Section 274250,
Clause 2.4AA (1-2) is an essential functionality required for the daily airport operations.
This required functionality was originally scheduled to be delivered in accordance with the
Contractor's Rev 11.2 Schedule. An NCR was issued (2) on 18 February 2019 which to date remains
open. In response to the open NCR, the Contractor stated that the required functionality was
scheduled to be delivered during Q2 2019. However, as of 13 February 2020, there is no clarity
when the Airport Pulse solution will be completed .
To avoid further delays, the Contractor is advised to take immediate steps in completing this
important system interface. The Contractor is also required to provide a completion schedule
through implementation and into a production environment. This shall include for full testing and
commissioning according to the established Project test procedures, and for Performance Testing
with the other Airport-wide Systems. The schedule shall be provided within 7 days from the date of
receipt of this letter.
We reserve the Employer's rights pursuant to Clause 10.3 of the Conditions of Contract for all delays
which may be caused to the Project as a result of the Contractor's inaction and non-compliance.
Yours faithfully
