Subject Contractor's Claim: Compensation for Employer's Breach of Contract {Specification
Dear Sir,
We refer to our letter referenced as (1) above, part of which was a reply to your letter referenced as (2)
above, and note that we have not received any response from you.
The electrical works that the Contractor alleged to have been omitted from the Contract are not part of
the Works under the Contract. Therefore, there cannot be any omission and loss of profit and
overheads.
Paragraph 1.5C of Specification Section 013115 does not place any obligation on the Employer to ensure
that Tenant Contractors employ for their fit out works the Contractor's Subcontractors. The purpose of
the paragraph is to make sure Tenant Contractors procure systems which are the same as or similar to
those provided by the Contractor to ensure continuity and compatibility for a seamless integration of
these systems.
As you are aware, many of the Contractor's Subcontractors, including Anel Emirates, are failing to fulfill
their obligations relating to their existing contracted scope. The Contractor's position that its
Subcontractors can even fulfill additional scope is not true.
Please respond to this letter no later than 7 Days from the date above if you disagree.
Yours faithfully,
