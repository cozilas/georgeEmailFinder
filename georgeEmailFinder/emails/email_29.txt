Subject Use of Aluminum Composite Panels (ACP}
Dear Sir,
It has been established that there are significant differences between the con.figuration of the ACP
assemblies and the original test data provided by the Contractor. These differences include but not
limited to, variations in the cavity width of the assemblies and the jointing arrangement between
panels.
The use of ACP and associated assemblies fall under the Curtain Walling Specification (074201) which is
a
performance specification. Therefore, it is the Contractor's responsibility to demonstrate such

assemblies meet the requirements of the International Building Code (IBC} 2006, which forms the basis
of the Fire Strategy for MTB.
Section 1407.10.4 of the 2006 version ofthe IBC requires metal composite materials containing plastic to
be tested to NFPA 285 Standard Fire Test Method for Evaluation of Fire Propagation Characteristics of
Exterior Non Load Bearing Wall Bearing Assemblies Containing Combustible Components.
Please provide evidence you have met your contractual obligations with respect to the fire performance
of such assemblies. This evidence shall include but not limited to:
• Identification of the various different configurations of assemblies involving the use of ACP.
• Fire test data from an accredited testing house which demonstrates such configurations do not
adversely affect the overall fire performance of the assemblies in comparison to the criteria
detailed in NFPA 285.
Subject Snagging de-snagging Through Zutec
Dear Sir,
In response to your letter (1), the three week Zutec trial for snagging and de-snagging was concluded
on 07 April 2018, after which the hard copy formats that were running in parallel to Zutec were to be
discontinued. Zutec has been officially operational as the single system for recording
snagging/desnagging
starting 08 April 2018.
Whilst you previously supplied the room areas details to enable Zutec be setup for snagging and
desnagging,
it recently transpired that some building area information was missing and this requires your
action and update. You are currently identifying these areas and in the interim, snag/de-snag hard
copies have been accepted and processed by the Engineer to avoid any delays.
You provided details for the missing areas in Piers 1 and 2 Gatehouses entrance walls and cladding
which has now been uploaded to Zutec. Please review the rest of the Piers and the CP for any other
areas and systems omitted from Zutec and provide your updates as required to ensure the Zutec
system is fully updated and useable for snagging and de-snagging.
Subject Inspection Following Ceiling Panel Fall Incident
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to the Contractor's recent incident where a previously installed ceiling panel
became dislodged and fell 25 meters, landing in close proximity to personnel operating at level 2 of the
CP Area of the MTB.
The Engineer and the Employer are yet to receive any progress updates as to the agreed and required
reinspection
of each installed ceiling panel that was detailed in post incident meetings and to be
conducted as a matter of priority.
The Engineer requires the Contractor to provide the following overdue information for the ceiling panels
and the inspection hatches:

• A specific strategy detailing the re-inspections and what they will entail, as well as confirmation
of the re-testing criteria, and method.
• It was also suggested that the removal of the polythene and the required cleaning of these
panels will be done simultaneously, please confirm.
• Program scheduling the start and completion of each section, including inspection milestones.
• Prevention measures to avoid any further disturbance of panels and inspection hatches.
• Detail the WIR process and communication to the Engineer.
• Contractor's point of contact who will be leading this inspection activity. The Contractor is required to
respond with all the information requested within 3 working days upon
receipt of this letter.
Subject: Project Director- Absenteeism
Dear Sir,
Further to the Principals Meeting of 24 April 2018, the Contractor records the absence of the
Subcontractor's Project Director Mr. Nicholas Galati from said meeting. This absence was without prior
notification and is of further concern since Mr. Galati is also the Subcontractor's appointed
representative.
The failure to attend the aforementioned meeting and a number of high level management meetings
over
the last few months has been noted by the Principals and for the avoidance of doubt is entirely
unacceptable without prior notification, explanation and delegation of authority pursuant to Clause
12.8.6
Conditions of Subcontract.
Notwithstanding the above, the Subcontractor is to advise the Contractor forthwith when Mr.Galati will
return to resume his duties and obligations under the Subcontract.
However, should Mr Galati be unable to perform his duties and obligations under the Subcontract,
which
include representation at high level management meetings, the Subcontractor pursuant to Clause 12.8
of
the Conditions of Subcontract shall confirm in writing a suitable replacement for due consideration by
the
Contractor.
Yours faithfully,
