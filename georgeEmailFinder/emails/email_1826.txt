Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to the Engineer's Variation Instruction No 121, received via reference 1,
instructing the design and construction of a third pedestrian entrance and associated underpass/subway
to Qatar National Museum ("QNM") Station pursuant to General Condition ("GC") 13.1.1 of Volume 3 of
the Contract.

The Contractor is of the opinion that, due to the receipt of El No 121, claim notices for an extension of
time pursuant to GC 8.4.2 and GC 20.1.2 are not required at this point as the QNM (Section Reference
M006.YE.ST.SHQ) Time for Completion Milestone, STKID. 03, does not require completion of the
aforementioned additional third pedestrian entrance and associated underpass/subway for the
Milestone to be met.

However, should the Employer, the Engineer, or the Engineer's Assistant subsequently advise the
Contractor in response to this letter that the Contractor's aforement ioned opinion is not agreed, the
Contractor shall then be entitled to treat such a negative response as a claim event and then issue its
notices of claim pursuant to GC 8.4.2 and GC 20.1.2 accordingly.

The Contractor therefore respectfully requests a formal response, by the below stated date, to the
Contractor's opinion that the subject matter of El No 121 is not required to be completed by the QNM's
STKID. 03 Time for Completion Date. A lack of formal response by the below stated date shall be treated
by the Contractor as agreement with the Contractor's aforementioned opinion until formally notified
otherwise by the Employer, the Engineer or the Engineer's Assistant.
Yours faithfully,
