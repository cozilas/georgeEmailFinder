Dear Sir,
We write in relation to your above referenced (1) letter regarding the Cancellation and Withdrawal of
RFVO's in relation to reversal of specialist systems value engineering items.
We would again highlight our above referenced (2) letter whereby we have identified that these items
would be captured and closed out through the issue of formal variation orders against the letting of
the respective defined provisional sum packages.
As you state in your letter the defined provisional sum items are paid based on the actual expenditure,
therefore we do not see the merit in reversing these items at this time, when the sums for the DPS will
be instructed for the actual value, and as such the value of the DPS is irrelevant be it including the VE
items or not.
In order to close these items out as you wish, we would encourage you to submit your RFVO for the
ICT, AOS & Security DPS packages so as we can then raise the formal Variation Order whereby we will
then subsequently remove the associated DPS value and replace with the corresponding package
value.
The reversal of the value engineering items therefore has no merit at this time and as such will be
dealt with through the Variation Order process pursuant to Clause 20 of the Conditions of Contract.
Yours faithfully,
