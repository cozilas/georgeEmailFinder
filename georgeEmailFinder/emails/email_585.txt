Subject:Coring of Waterproofed Manholes
Dear Sir,
Further to the above mentioned subject the Contractor wishes to clarify and further requests the
Engineer as per the below.
In response to our email the Engineer referred to their correspondence reference (1) stating that in
accordance with Specification Section 071326 the waterproofing of the manhole structure is an element
for which the Contractor is responsible for in terms of the selection, design and warranties in terms of
application.
However, we are not entirely in agreement with this as we are not responsible for the selection and
design of the waterproofing system and details. We are responsible to provide all labour, Materials,
Contractorâ€™s Equipment and Plant to fully execute the requirements to furnish, deliver, and install the
Works as expressly described in the Drawings and Specifications, or implied therefrom, and in
accordance with the Contract pursuant to the above-mentioned Specification Section.
We also do not deny that the rectification and integrity of the said waterproofing falls under our scope,
but due to the nature of the work (rectification of existing work compromised by core drilling) we are
not responsible for the methodology of the reinstatement works and requested you in our email
reference (2) to provide this including maintaining details of the waterproofing to ensure the integrity of
it.
Once again we request the Engineer to provide us with further details, decisions, directions and
instructions pursuant to Clause 11.3 (Instructions of the Engineer) of the Conditions of Contract to
provide us with a practical methodology to implement these rectification works.
In the absence of the above requested instruction we are unable to proceed with the works and we will
not be held responsible for any delays as a consequence.
Yours faithfully
