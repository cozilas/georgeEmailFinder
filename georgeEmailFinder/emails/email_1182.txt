Subject: Request for Outstanding Cost Substantiation for EOT 1
Dear Sir,
Further to our Minutes of Meeting dated 23rd August 2017, copy attached, the Contractor has
requested
the Subcontractor to provide the outstanding Cost Substantiation for Prolongation Costs for EoT 1 for
the
following period;
December 2013 to May 2014

The Contractor records that, as at the date of this letter, the Subcontractor has failed to provide the
requested cost substantiation.
The Contractor requests the Subcontractor to submit within 14 days of receipt of this letter the
outstanding Cost Substantiation as requested by the Contractor. The Contractor notes that should the
Subcontractor fail to provide the requested Cost Substantiation, it would prejudice the outcome of the
Subcontractor's Entitlement (if any) for Prolongation Costs under EoT 1.
Furthermore, if the Contractor does not receive the requested Cost Substantiation within 14 days of
receipt of this letter, the Contractor shall assume that the Subcontractor has waived any and all
entitlement during the periods that the Subcontractor has failed to provide either the requested
detailed
Cost Substantiation, or satisfactory Substantiation.
For the avoidance of doubt, the request by the Contractor for the outstanding Cost Substantiation is not,
of itself, to be considered as an admission of any entitlement to an extension of the Time for Completion
and/or payment of additional Costs, nor does it constitute a waiver of any of the terms of the
Subcontract.
Yours faithfully,
