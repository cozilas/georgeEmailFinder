payment of any Cost so incurred as an addition to the Contract Price pursuant to GC 8.9.1(b) and, may
provide the Contractor with entitlement to receive extension(s) to the affected Time(s) for Completion

pursuant to GC 8.9.1(a) and 8.4.1(b) for any delays consequently incurred due to suspending the
Contractor's progress of the aforementioned Sections of the Works.

Accordingly, the Contractor hereby notifies the Engineer's Assistant of the Contractor's intention to
claim for its possible entitlement (1) for additional payment of any Cost incurred due to El Nr 126
(notification pursuant to GC 8.9.1(b) and GC 20.1.2) and, (2) for any extensions to the affected Time(s)
for Completion for any delays that may be incurred due to El Nr 126 (notification pursuant to GC 8.4.2,

Please rest assured however that notwithstanding the above, the Contractor will endeavour, in
accordance with its contractual obligations, to mitigate any delays and additional costs incurred due to
El Nr 126.
Yours faithfully,
