Subject: Project Director- Absenteeism
Dear Sir,
Further to the Principals Meeting of 24 April 2018, the Contractor records the absence of the
Subcontractor's Project Director Mr. Nicholas Galati from said meeting. This absence was without prior
notification and is of further concern since Mr. Galati is also the Subcontractor's appointed
representative.
The failure to attend the aforementioned meeting and a number of high level management meetings
over the last few months has been noted by the Principals and for the avoidance of doubt is entirely
unacceptable without prior notification, explanation and delegation of authority pursuant to Clause
12.8.6 Conditions of Subcontract.
Notwithstanding the above, the Subcontractor is to advise the Contractor forthwith when Mr.Galati will
return to resume his duties and obligations under the Subcontract.
However, should Mr Galati be unable to perform his duties and obligations under the Subcontract,
which include representation at high level management meetings, the Subcontractor pursuant to Clause
12.8 of the Conditions of Subcontract shall confirm in writing a suitable replacement for due
consideration by the Contractor.
Yours faithfully,
