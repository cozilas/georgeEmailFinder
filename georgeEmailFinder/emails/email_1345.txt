Dear Sir,

Further to the Contractor's fully detailed interim ELS Claim submission (Revision 1) issued under cover of
reference 22 and, further to the Contractor's January 20 16 monthly update of same issued under cover
of

reference 4, the Contractor hereby provides, in accordance with General Condition ("GC") 20.1.6(b) of
Volume 3 of the Contract, its February 2016 monthly update of the ELS Claim with respect to the
following additional financial information.

The January 2016 ELS Claim update contained the following Financial Summary:

Description of Value/Cost
Qatari Riyals

Additional Site Running Costs to date (Loss and/or Expense)
149,249,110.00
Additional Design Costs to date [Atkins claim, O&K, Arup] + DVE 10,930,825.00
Value of ELS Variation to date
Disruption Costs

147,719,261.00

TBC

Contractor's Overheads & Profit to date 40,026,895.00
Finance Charges to date (including OHP upon same)

19,730,531.00

Total Claim (to date)
367,656,622.00

No payment has been received by the Contractor with respect to ELS Claim. Accordingly the total
finance costs to date (29.02.16) and, overheads and profit upon same are calculated as follows :

(1)
Total Claim Value for January 2016 (excluding Finance Charges) = OAR 367,656,622.00 - OAR
19,730,531.00= OAR 347,926 ,091.00.

(2)

Finance Costs from 25 March 2014 to 30 June 2015:

The Contractor was delayed and started to incur additional costs from the initial 25 March 2014 ELS
Presentation. Therefore, up to the date of the 30 June 2015 ELS Claim update, the financing costs
incurred are as follows:

OAR 347,926,091.00 (Total Claim Costs to 30 June 2015 excluding finance costs) x 0.5 x 432 days/365
days x 4.25% pa = OAR 8,750,579 .00.

(3)

Finance Costs from 30 June 2015 to 29 February 2016:

(QAR 347,926,091.00 (Total Claim Costs from 30 June 2015 to 29 February 2016 excluding finance &
associated OHP costs) x 244 days/365 days x 4.25% pa = QAR 9,884,914 .00.

(4)
Therefore , Total Finance Costs from 25 March 2014 to 29 February 2016 are: QAR 8,750,579.00
+ QAR 9,884 ,914.00 = QAR 18,635,493.00.
(5)
Overheads and Profit ("OHP") upon Total Finance Costs from 25 March 20 14 to 29 February
2016 are: QAR 18,635,493 .00 x 13% OHP = QAR 2,422,614.00.
(6)
Therefore, Total Finance Charges and OHP on same from 25 March 2014 to 29 February 2016
are: QAR 18,635,493.00+ QAR 2,422,614.00 = QAR 21.058.107.00
Accordingly, the revised/updated ELS Claim financial amount at 29 February 2016 is collated within the
revised ELS Claim Financial Summary below:

FINANCIAL SUMMARY
