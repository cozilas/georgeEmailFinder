ANNEX A
Description of the Event
SDS/0401/M/0957-05
On 5 December 2018 we issued Shop Drawing Submittal No. SDS/0401/M/0957-05 requesting your
approval of Shop Drawing No: 401-EF-M-02-34-5.32B-AC-SD-001 Rev 04, relating to the ‘Mechanical
Duct Layout L3.4 (Hotel/Offices/Lounges Level) Sector 5.32B’ in the manner shown in Table 1 below.

Article 1.3 of Specification Section 013300 ‘Submittal Procedures’ governs the processing time by which
you are contractually obligated to respond to our Submittals. On the basis that Shop Drawing Submittal
No: SDS/0401/M/0957 is at Rev. 05, then this should have been responded to by you 7 calendar days
later, i.e. on 12 December 2018. However, Table 1 above shows that you exceeded the contract review
period for responding to our Submittal by 21 calendar days, i.e. 2 January 2019.
Irrespective, we received a Status Code 3 response to SDS/0401/M/0957-05 together with a series of
comments annotated upon Shop Drawing No: 401-EF-M-02-34-5.32B-AC-SD-001 Rev 04. These include
amongst other things, the following comments in relation to the ductwork (Figure 1 refers).
Figure 1– Status Code 3 Comments
Shop Drawing No: 401-EF-M-02-34-5.32B-AC-SD-001-Rev 04
It is disappointing to note that the Employer’s Design Consultant had maintained its position as per its
previous response to SDS/0401/M/0957-04 / Shop Drawing No: 401-EF-M-02-34-5.32B-AC-SD-001 Rev
03 [issued on 12 August 2018 and responded to on 16 August 2018, and has elected to overlook or
ignore what was previously discussed and agreed at the Briefing Pack 10 design meetings. .
RFI/0401/17425-00
On 3 September 2019, we raised RFI/0401/17425-00 (‘Comment on Shop Drawing – Ductwork Route at
Hotel Building L3.4’), enclosing a series of attachments (consisting of e-mails, a BP 10 sketch plus our
own sketch layout), in which we advised you of a series of concerns in relation to the Employer’s Design
Consultant’s [KPF] comments endorsed on Shop Drawing No: 401-EF-M-02-34-5.32B-AC-SD-001 Rev 04 –
primarily relating to the provision of access for cleaning of horizontal ducts as well as comments on the
ductwork blocking the access walkway (refer to the extract in Figure 1 above):
As noted, the Employer’s Design Consultant’s [KPF] comments clearly demonstrate that he had either
overlooked or otherwise ignored the fact that the duct route show upon the Shop Drawing had
previously been agreed at previous BP 10 design meetings involving both the Employer’s Design
Consultant [KPF] and yourselves in early 2018, albeit for reasons that remain unclear, the Employer’s
Design Consultant [KPF] had not signed the BP10 sketch {attached thereto). By the same token, KPF had
overlooked or ignored more recent discussions, where, it was agreed by all parties, including the Design
Consultant [KPF] to adopt the solutions agreed in 2018 with the exception of certain lights:

For the avoidance of any doubt, RFI/0401/17425-00 is worded as follows:
‘Referring to the Design Consultant code-3 comments on drawing 401-EF-M-02-34-5.32B-AC-SD-001
[Rev. 03], in which the Consultant highlighted that that the duct routing is obstructing the maintenance
access and is blocking the lighting fixtures placed on the Hotel roof. The Contractor notes that the
current duct route was agreed with both the Design Consultant and the Engineer back in February 2018
following a series of meetings and workshops (See attached emails).
The Contractor further issued a revised BP-10 sketch (See attached) which was signed by the Contractor
and the Engineer; however, it was not signed by the Design Consultant which led to these comments
being raised again by the Design Consultant although the solution was agreed.
The Contractor recently, studied and explored other options with the Design Consultant to resolve the
clashes, for example shifting the 5 lighting fixtures obstructed by the duct to above the duct but the
results were not satisfactory to both the Contractor and the Designer.
It was later agreed by all parties to adopt the solutions agreed in 2018 with the exception that the 5
lights will be kept in horizontal position and not to be rotated 90 degrees as advised earlier. The
Contractor was also requested to raise an RFI to document these changes.’
As noted, attached to RFI/0401/17425-00 were various e-mails, a BP10 sketch plus a sketch layout.
Copies of the e-mails are provided hereto at Annex B. These confirm numerous discussions and site
visits that were conducted to resolve the previous concerns associated with the access to the ducts and
duct-related works. By way of specific example our email sent to you on 28 February 2018 [Tuesday 4:10
PM], confirmed the resolution of the issues regarding the accessibility of the ducts for maintenance and
the clashes of the ductwork with the lighting fixtures. In our email we also included a sketch providing a
3D snapshot demonstrating the actions which have been taken to resolve the issues of the ductworks
located at Hotel Building L3.4 Sector 5.32B (reproduced in Figure 2 below):
Figure 2
As noted in the comments to Figure 2 above, the ducts have been rerouted side by side and the catwalk
to the specific area below the arch has been omitted. Furthermore “5 pieces of U1C lighting fixtures
have been rotated vertically to accommodate the fixtures between the duct and balustrade with the
light direction towards the louver. KPF also confirmed that the rest of U1C lighting fixtures will continue
facing the ceiling but the lighting will be directed towards the louver”.
Also attached to RFI RFI/0401/17425 is a revised BP-10 sketch issued and signed by you and ourselves
(Figure 3 refers), after the matters in relation to the purported accessibility issues to the ducts and the
clashes of the ductwork with the lighting fixtures had been resolved. However, as noted above, the
sketch was not signed by KPF, which has since led to KPF rejecting Shop Drawing No: 401-EF-M-02-345.32B-AC-SD-001 Rev 03 and providing the Code 3 comments described above, despite the design issues
having previously been discussed and agreed – with the full knowledge of KPF.
Figure 3
We concluded RFI/0401/17425-00 by asking you / the Employer’s Design Consultant [KPF] to
1.
Confirm acceptance to the current duct routing as shown on the shop drawing; and
2.
Confirm acceptance to shift the 5 lighting fixtures as marked on attached sketch.
We requested a response to RFI/0401/17425-00 by 8 September 2019. However you failed to reply until
circa seven weeks later on 21 October 2019. Unfortunately, rather than the Employer’s Design
Consultant [KPF] address what was being requested, KPF’s response stated the following:
‘The attached RFI should have been submitted as Field Modification Request to the CMA and dealt with
by CMA. We have given our comments at ADAC's request to assist the project but have no responsibility
for the measures the JV adopt to rectify their defects and have no requirement to update IFC for any

responses to these RFIs. The response to this RFI shall not set a precedent for requests from the
Contractor to deviate from the approved shop drawings and the CMA should review for similar
situations on site. The changes proposed by the Contractor shall have no increased cost or programme
impact to the client: This RFI is not a simple issue. CMA have assumed design responsibility for changes
to the ducting on the roof without getting technical input from the design team.
We have given our technical comments below at ADAC's request to assist the project. The Contractor is
seeking to retain the parallel HVAC duct installations on the hotel roof which are contrary to the KPF
issued IFC where the HVAC ducts are double stacked. The impacts of the proposed layout include: Access to maintain the KEF and SEF in the fan rooms on the hotel roof is blocked. -An Egress route from
half of the hotel roof is blocked –Access to the proposed additional grease trap is not possible due to the
lack of a co-ordinated services installation on the hotel roof. - The modified duct routing results in light
fittings being moved which has an adverse impact on the lighting design. Arup have previously raised
this issue with ADAC, CMA and KPF in June 2019. In light of the comments above, we cannot support
the change as directed by CMA. We would recommend that ADAC reject this change.’
Accordingly, we make the following comments:
1.
The ‘measures’ reflected within the content of and attachments to RFI/0401/17425-00 were not
made to overcome our “defects”. These reflect a deficiency in the design and we simply were recording
what had been suggested and agreed at the time to overcome the same.
2.
We further note that having previously been subject to the discussions outlined above, KPF are
now seemingly absolving themselves of any liability for involvement with and resolution of, a particular
issue that is after all a deficiency in their design / design coordination issue. Simply, it is KPF’s problem
and they are stepping aside rather than assist with resolving it.
3.
While the matters subject to RFI/0401/17425 are ‘contrary to the IFC design’, the Employer’s
Design Consultant is reminded that it is because of inconsistencies in the IFC Design and poorly
coordinated design issues such as this, that the Briefing Pack ‘design development’ process was
instigated [at the behest of KPF / Engineer / Employer] in order to seek our assistance in trying to
resolve both the inconsistences in the design as well as design changes. This matter was discussed in
the design development meetings for Briefing Pack 10. Within RFI/0401/17425 we were simply
providing a backdrop and recording what occurred [and what was agreed to] previously and how the
latest KPF’s comments endorsed on Shop Drawing No: 401-EF-M-02-34-5.32B-AC-SD-001 Rev 03 are
entirely contrary to what the parties discussed and agreed during the BP-10 design meetings, and
sought further advice on the matter.
However, rather than take ownership and properly addressing a valid design issue, it is clear from the
above comments that KPF are ‘side stepping’ the issue, in particular we note:
1.
KPF’s statement that the matters subject to RFI/0401/17425-00 should have been submitted as
a Field Modification Request (FMR) to the CMA for the CMA to be dealt with by CMA (CMA for the CMA
to be dealt with by CMA);
2.
KPF’s statement that “CMA have assumed design responsibility for the changes in the ducting”
at the Hotel Building Level L3.4 Sector 5.32B [which we believe is not the case at all]; and
3.
KPF advising that it cannot support the change [identified in RFI/0401/17425-00] as directed by
CMA and a recommendation that ADAC reject this change [in design and scope].
With these statements, it is clear that KPF is undeniably aware of the numerous discussions, meetings
and resultant agreements mentioned above to resolve these issues, which they consider have taken
place without their direct involvement. Thus, it is evident that KPF is unwilling to take ownership and
address this matter, which in its view, you [the Engineer] and ADAC, have assumed responsibility for.
Nevertheless, ADAC’s response annotated on the RFI/0401/17425 reply, referred to an unreferenced /
unnumbered 2 page attachment appended thereto that purports to record various matters subject to a

site visit conducted on 13 October 2019 between us (TCA JV), you (CMA) and ADAC, “to find the most
probable solutions to the Contractor’s requested confirmations in this RFI [RFI/0401/17425].”
We note however, rather than just limiting this ‘to the Contractor’s requested confirmations in this RFI
[RFI/0401/17425]’, ADAC have sought to use this as an opportunity in commenting on issues that are
out with the scope of the RFI [mechanical] and comment on architectural issues also.
Notwithstanding, we have taken the liberty of providing a response alongside each ADAC comment,
elaborating on the actions which have been undertaken by us since the RFI response was received, as a
means of demonstrating the address / resolution of each issue (refer to Table 2 below). Please note that
copies of the various e-mail correspondences referenced below are included at Annex C hereto.
Table 2
CMA COMMENTS
TCA JV RESPONSE
1. “RFI Item 1 – Acceptance of the current duct routing
In general, given the structural constraints, the duct routing is acceptable. However, not all services
were adequately coordinated. The CMA needs to work with the Contractor to resolve the following
items: We note that the ducts’ route has been accepted by ADAC, “given the structural constraints” as
noted in your comments. Furthermore, we confirm that we have been working closely with you (the
Engineer) and have addressed all your/ADAC’s concerns raised in RFI/0401/17425, associated with the
ductwork located at the Hotel Building Level L3.4 Sector 5.32B.
a. Issue 1 – The grease trap and associated access door is not accessible (see highlighted in the
screenshot below). The 800x300 smoke duct blocks the AD as it drops down to pass under the arch.
Also, the drain is not accessible from the guardrail side that KEF duct.
• Action –Contractor to rotate and/or relocate the grease trap to make it accessible from the catwalk.
‘a’– ‘Issue 1’ – Following, your/ADAC’s comment in relation to the grease traps’ accessibility
issues, we have taken actions to address these issues and have informed you accordingly via our email
dated 17 December 2019 [5:00 PM] attached at Annex C, wherein we confirmed the following:
“Further to the response to RFI-17425 and as directed by ADAC in their response to Item 1 - Issue 1, the
Contractor has rotated the grease trap and the access door at the kitchen extract duct (See attached
photo and the below red line marking)”.
Furthermore, in regards to the accessibility issues to the ducts, mentioned in your comments we have
informed you via our email dated 5 January 2020 [Sunday 10:19 AM] attached to Annex C hereto, that
the access to the ducts for inspection and maintenance of the grease traps at the discussed area is
congested, however, it is in fact accessible as shown in Figure A below.

Figure A
Additionally, in our email dated 5 January 2020 [Sunday 10:19 AM] we have also informed you that we
have tested the grease traps’ slope by pouring a small amount of water and found that the water is in
fact reaching towards the drain points properly. In addition during the maintenance we were able to
place a tray underneath the drain point to remove the grease/oil. Consequently, it is apparent that there
are no issues with the grease trap accessibility or functionality (Figure B refers).
Figure B

b. Issue 2 – Fan rooms have access constraints to be addressed by the Contractor and CMA (see
highlighted in the screen shot below). The head height in area 1 is low and requires appropriate
marking/padding and/or shifting. If shifted, coordinate with Issue 1 above. In addition, the duct supports
in this area constitute a tripping hazard and need an appropriate crossing (e.g., low-rise catwalk). There
is no apparent access to the fan room door in area 2, and needs an appropriate crossing over the duct.
• Action –Contractor to agree appropriate solutions for access ‘b’ – ‘Issue 2’ (Fan rooms have access
constraints to be addressed by the Contractor and CMA). This is another issue that is not relevant to the
mechanical issues discussed in the RFI and cannot be considered to form part of the discussions
associated with the re-coding of the mechanical Shop Drawing ref: 401-EF-M-02-34-5.32B-AC-SD-001Rev05, also discussed in this E-Notice. For clarity, we note that the issues raised by ADAC to the RFI also
shown at the left hand side herewith in Table 2, are related to architectural issues and not mechanical
issues and therefore must be dealt with separately.
c. Issue 3 – Single egress route. As discussed with the design team, the routing of the duct in this space is
acceptable, if the maximum travel distance is no more than 23 meters.
• Action –Contractor to agree appropriate solutions for egress with the CMA, as part of the Contractor’s
work coordination.
We acknowledge your statement that “the routing of the duct in this space is
acceptable, if the maximum travel distance is no more than 23 meters”. However, the issue with the
travel distance has been addressed and we have informed you, via our email dated 5 January 2020
[Sunday, 3:26 PM] attached to Annex D hereto. In our email we explained that based on the IFC Design
provided by you in relation to the egress route of the ducts, the distance to the escape ladders to the
North and West of the ducts is nevertheless designed to be more than 23 meters.
This is explained further in our aforementioned email enclosed to Annex D, wherein we explained that
the duct obstructing the egress path has no impact on the travel distance to reach the egress ladders.
We also provided you with two (2) snapshots, namely ‘Case 1’ and ‘Case 2’, explaining and
demonstrating the egress route to the North and West.
As indicated in our aforementioned email, the best case scenario regarding the travel distance from the
point where the ducts are located to the egress ladder, is around 33-35 meters. We reiterate that this
travel distance is in accordance with the IFC Design. This is presented in the snapshot ‘Case 1’ in our
email (reproduced in Figure C) below.
Figure C
As stated in our email ‘Case 1’ (Figure C), the travel distance from where the duct is located to the North
egress ladder, is 34.37m (more than 23m).
In addition, snapshot ‘Case 2’ (reproduced in Figure D), indicates that the travel distance from where the
ducts are located to the West egress ladder is 33.65 meters (more than 23m).
Figure D
Consequently, as stated above and in our email, the ducts obstructing the path have no impact on the
travel distance. Moreover, the travel distance by the Design, is nevertheless more than 23 meters. For
these reasons, your comment that “the maximum travel distance is no more than 23 meters”, cannot be
accepted and are invalid.
Notwithstanding, if you wish to instigate any change in relation to the egress route to the ducts, then
this will require the issuance of new IFC Drawings and a Variation Order; this is after the additional time
and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand as per SAA8.
2. RFI Item 2 – Acceptance of shifting the 5 lighting fixtures as marked in the RFI
1. In general, the proposal is acceptable. However, final location needs to be coordinated during
commissioning of the lights and duct rectifications noted above in Item 1.

• Action –Contractor to ensure proper light installation (placement, lux levels, etc.), and finalize
coordination during commissioning.

We acknowledge that the five (5) lighting fixtures have been accepted by you and confirm that a
“proper light installation (placement, lux levels, etc.)” and finalization of “coordination during
commissioning” has been ensured.
3. Item 3 – Coordination of other issues noted from site walk
1. Access ladder to the L3.4 Roof area. The two hoop ladders fitted on the west side of the hotel may
constrain firefighter’s access (with equipment) to this area and will need to be agreed with ADAC fire.
The ladder on the east side is under an NCR with the CMA and needs to be resolved (and agreed with
ADAC fire).
• Action –Contractor to agree appropriate solutions for ladder (as noted above) with the CMA, as part of
the Contractor’s work coordination.
2. General catwalk provisions in the area to provide adequate (safe) access and support for equipment
and maintenance personnel movement.
• Action –Contractor to agree appropriate solutions with the CMA, as part of the Contractor’s work
coordination.” Item 3 discussed by ADAC to RFI/0401/17425, namely “coordination of other issues
noted from site walk”, is exactly that, other issues, which are not relevant to the mechanical issues
discussed in the RFI and cannot be considered to form part of the discussions associated with the recoding of the mechanical Shop Drawing ref: 401-EF-M-02-34-5.32B-AC-SD-001-Rev05, also discussed in
this E-Notice. For clarity, we note that the issues raised by ADAC to the RFI also shown at the left hand
side herewith in Table 2, are related to architectural issues and not mechanical issues and therefore
must be dealt with separately.
SDS/0401/M/0957-06
Further to which, on 12 January 2020, we submitted Shop Drawing Submittal No. SDS/0401/M/0957-06
requesting approval of Shop Drawing No: 401-EF-M-02-34-5.32B-AC-SD-001 Rev 05, ‘Mechanical Duct

4 days
Again, when viewed against the contractually obligated response times per Article 1.3 of Specification
Section 013300 ‘Submittal Procedures’, then Table 3 shows that you exceeded the contract review
period in respect of Shop Drawing Submittal No: SDS/0401/M/0957-06 by 4 calendar days. Any delay to
any submittal, irrespective of the duration, is unacceptable, particularly at this stage of the Project.
We further record that the Code 3 response to SDS/0401/M/0957-05 was accompanied by a series of
comments annotated upon Shop Drawing No: 401-EF-M-02-34-5.32B-AC-SD-001 Rev 05. These include
amongst other things, the following comments in relation to the ductwork (Figure 4 refers).
Figure 4 – Further Status Code 3 Comments
Shop Drawing No: 401-EF-M-02-34-5.32B-AC-SD-001-Rev 05
Although we reminded you of the content of RFI/0401/17425 [by a note endorsed on Drawing No: 401EF-M-02-34-5.32B-AC-SD-001 Rev 05 issued vide SDS/0401/M/0957-06 on 12 January 2020], we are
again disappointed that the Design Consultant has maintained its position as per its previous responses
to Shop Drawing No: 401-EF-M-02-34-5.32B-AC-SD-001 Rev 03 and Rev. 4, submitted vide

SDS/0401/M/0957 Rev. 4 and Rev. 5 (described above), and has ignored any previous agreement we
reached with those involved, and the very crux of the matter that was subject to RFI/0401/17425.
At the risk of being repetitive, we advised you that the current duct route was agreed with both the
Design Consultant and the Engineer back in February 2018 ….[and while we] issued a revised BP-10
sketch … it was not signed by the Design Consultant ….although the solution was agreed.” “It was later
agreed by all parties to adopt the solutions agreed in 2018 ….” We simply wanted confirmation that this
was indeed the case; and moreover we complied with the request to document this via an RFI. However,
having done so and rather than properly address this, or offer an alternative solution, the Employer’s
Design Consultant has referred us back to fact the ductwork is blocking access.
Once again it is extremely disconcerting to note that rather than assist us and resolve what is after all a
design issue, the Design Consultant has elected to maintain its position and similarly elected to ignore
the content of RFI/0401/17425, and ignored the history of events associated with this matter.
However, despite us providing detailed clarifications and explaining the measures taken to address all
your / ADAC’s / KPF’s concerns in regards to the accessibility to the ducts and ductwork installed at the
Hotel Building to Level 3.4, and despite us requesting that Shop Drawing No: 401-EF-M-02-34-5.32B-ACSD-001-Rev05 be recoded, including a request made via email on 26 January 2020 [8:48 AM] copy
attached at Annex E, you / KPF have failed to do so – hence the issuance of this E-Notice.
In view of the foregoing, this issue is not being addressed; despite our sincere requests for resolution –
neither by you as the Engineer for the Project, nor the Employer’s Design Consultant. Therefore, in view
of the events and circumstances outlined above, we maintain that the Status Code 3 comments issued in
response to Shop Drawing No: 401-EF-M-02-34-5.32B-AC-SD-001-Rev 05, are unreasonable and
inapplicable, and we urge you to immediately re-code it to a minimum of Status Code 2.
Consequently, until such time as you do so re-code Shop Drawing No: 401-EF-M-02-34-5.32B-AC-SD001-Rev 05, we are prevented from completing the remaining Works and / or testing and
commissioning, which will in time, invariably impact our ability to achieve Substantial Completion.
Despite this event having it origins in 2018 [as noted above], we wish to make it clear that its cannot
possibly be construed as forming part of or ‘Included Circumstances’ (per Clause 1.7.4 of SAA8) and will
be included within any forthcoming Time Impact Analysis, albeit in recognition of the Effective Date
included in SAA8, any delays will be analysed from 4 September 2018 onwards. SAA8 cannot reasonably
be interpreted as requiring the Contractor to absorb delays of unknown (possibly unlimited) duration
occurring pre/post 4 September 2018, particularly where the resolution of the matter causing the delay
lies with the Employer. We contend therefore that under the circumstances the responsibility, under
the Contract (as amended by SAA8), for such delays lies with the Employer.
Yours faithfully,
