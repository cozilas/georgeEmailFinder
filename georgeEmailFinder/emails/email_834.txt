Subject:Failure to Deliver Material for Fabrication of Swing Doors
Dear Sir,
With reference to the above subject and after our visit to your factory on Sunday 17th June 2018, we
write to inform you about our disappointment in regards to your failure to deliver the materials for the
works on site.
Specifically, M/S Formwell is yet to receive adequate stock of materials which will enable them to
proceed with the fabrication of the top and bottom rails of the swing doors. We also raise our concern
on the fact that there are not enough materials to complete the works at P4 and strictly notify you that
these on going delays have to be rectified immediately.
In light of the above, your lack of progress, the late fabrication and delivery of materials which has
negatively impacted the installation works and subsequently will impact the target completion dates, is
put on record.
You are therefore instructed pursuant to Subcontract Clause 11.3 [Instructions of the Contractor] to
immediately take action and submit a mitigation plan (that includes delivery schedule with shipping
dates as well as measures of fabrication, delivery and installation) no later than 7 days from receipt of
this letter.
The aforesaid mitigation plan should clearly indicate the recovery of the current delays with the
objective of completing all activities as per the required and committed dates. Additionally, you are also
required to provide evidence of the order / acknowledgment of the raw materials purchased from Assa
Abloy USA with shipping dates and delivery schedule.
You are again reminded that any delays, costs, losses and/or expenses incurred by us and/or Other
Subcontractor/s arising as a result of the above delays shall be at your risk and recovered from your
account in accordance with the Subcontract Clauses 10.3 [Contractors Claims], 16.6.1 [Delays Damages]
and other relevant clauses.
This is for your immediate action.
Yours faithfully,
