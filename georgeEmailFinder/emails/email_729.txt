Reply - Comments on Insurance Policies

Dear Sir,
We acknowledge receipt of your letter referenced in (11) above and inform you that it is very
concerning, that you are continuously trying to deviate from the agreed Conditions of the Subcontract,
asserting that you are not obligated to provide a compliant Professional Indemnity Insurance.
We continue to reiterate our position as per our letter referenced in (10) above, with regards to the
agreed terms and conditions of the Subcontract as per Schedule 14 [Insurances] as well as Appendix ‘N’
of the tender documents. Additionally, you are again referred to the enclosed Subcontract Agreement
Pages 567 & 580 respectively, which clearly outline your obligations for the provision of the Insurances.
You are kindly reminded that these are mandatory Insurance requirements of the project and in no way,
M/S Prometal can be exempted from such.
We hereby reject the content of your letters referenced (9) & (11) above respectively. Please note that,
despite your failure to comply with the Insurance provisions of the Subcontract, to date, we have
released all due payments up to June 2018, Payment Certificate No. 6.
You are reminded that as per Clause 5.1 of Schedule 11 [Payment Terms] “No amount shall be paid to
the Subcontractor until the Contractor has received and approved […] evidence of the Subcontractor’s
Insurances […]”.
In view of the above, we reiterate that you are required to revise and resubmit your Insurance Policies
as per our comments made herein and vide our previous correspondences. In the event that you do not
comply with our Instructions accordingly, Clause 5.1 [Interim Payments] of Schedule 11 (Payment
Terms) will be put into effect.
This is for your utmost attention and immediate action.
Yours faithfully,
