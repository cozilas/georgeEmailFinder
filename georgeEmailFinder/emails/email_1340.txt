Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to the Engineer's Assistant's ("EA") disapproval and detailed comments issued
pursuant to Volume 3's Sub-Clause 20.1.8 under cover of reference 11 with respect to the Contractor's
Claim 001 (Rev
01) November 2014 Update.
The Contractor refuses to accept the EA's disapproval of the Contractor's Claim noted with reference 11
and within subsequent references from the EA. To this end, the Contractor hereby attaches its detailed
response, comments and argument to each and every comment/statement raised by the EA within its
disapproval and detailed comments.
The Contractor therefore continues to maintain its right to entitlement for additional
payment/adjustment of the Contract Price in accordance with the arguments and information provided
within its submitted Claim 001 and within the Contractor's detailed response, comments and argument
(attached to this letter) to the EA's disapproval and detailed comments.

Furthermore and notwithstanding the EA's comment within reference 1"that the effects resulting from
the claim have ended," the Contractor will shortly be submitting a further Claim 001 update
incorporating, inter alia, the latest costing information received by the Contractor to date.

Yours faithfully,
