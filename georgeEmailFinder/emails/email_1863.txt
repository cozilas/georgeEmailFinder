Dear Sir,

The Contractor is writing to inform the Engineer’s Assistant, (PMC) regarding the current situation at Ras
Bu Abboud Station. In particular, the divergence between the current design of the station and the
documents received in response to our Value Engineering (VE) proposal. The Contractor seeks
clarification on these the requirements outlined in these documents and direction with regards to the
ongoing construction.

A document prepared by Takamol Portfolio Management Group, “Encroachment on Right of Way” was
issued to the PMC and copied, for information only, to the Contractor on 19 March 2015, through
Aconex and an email was received from PMC on 12 April 2015 with basic revised Employers
requirements and a new layout for ACN. The email also clearly states that it was for Information only
and that these requirements would be formalized by issue of an Instruction. Neither of these documents
contained guidance on how to proceed. The Contractor has since written to request Instructions on
these, as the implications will result in major changes to the Employer’s Requirements and subsequently
the design. To date no Instructions have been issued on the subject.

The Contractor at this time is progressing the construction of the Station in accordance with the current
DD2 designs, which have the status D-NOWC (No Objection with Comments). The design at this time
takes no cognizance of the requirements as stated above.

On Saturday, 9th of May 2015, the Contractor is scheduled to pour slab 6 of the Station base slab. In the
absence of an Instruction to the contrary these works will continue.

The Contractor reiterates its request for formal Instruction on the above requirements and clarity on the
on-going construction works.

Yours faithfully,
