Dear Sir,
The Engineer's Assistant would like to remind ALYSJ JV of its obligations to fulfill the Employers
Requirements, Volume 6, Clause 11.4.3 Landscaping, specifically regarding the urban integration of ".....
all functional and structural features pertaining to stations ...." by minimizing the visual impact of
technical Pop Ups on the urban environment.

Please see the attached sketch for reference.

Further, we refer you to Employers Requirements, Volume 6, Clause 13.2.3.1 (n) Chilled Water System I
Central Plant which details a typical dry cooled chiller pit.

For chiller yards and tunnel ventilation/draught relief shafts, the equipment shall be located in a sunken
plaza as far away from the public view as is technically feasible.

For emergency exits, the enclosed stair structure shall terminate below grade with only an exposed
stair leading to grade level.

In all other cases where the above measures cannot be implemented, ALYSJ JV will need to provide
justification on a case to case basis which will need to be evaluated by Qatar Rail. We request that ALYSJ
JV provides a report detailing the feasibility of such measures at each station at the earliest possible
time to avoid future delay to deslgii developi11e11t.

Finally, please note that any protective railing or parapet wall that will be required at grade needs to be
in line with the branding design intent.
Yours faithfully,
