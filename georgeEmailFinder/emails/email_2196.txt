Dear Sir,

Reference is made to the Engineer's Assistant's letters items 3 and 4 and the reminders items 1 and 2
regarding the direction under clause 13.2.1 of the General Conditions to submit quotations for the
modifications to the Employer's Requirements.

The Contractor confirms that the letters are all request on the same subject matter which is the
modification of the allowable voltage drop.

The allowable voltage drop which is currently 2.5% in accordance with the Kahramaa specification,
which has now been extended to 6% for lighting loads and 8% for any other loads in accordance with
BS7671 and IEC 60364-5-52. The Contractor confirms that this new requirement has been incorporated
into the MEP designs currently included in the Tender documents for the MEP Provisional Sums
packages.

The Contractor trusts that this clarifies the current situation.
Yours faithfully,
