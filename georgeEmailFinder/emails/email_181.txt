Subject: Flood damage in basement levels LBl and LB 2
Dear Sirs,
We refer to your letter noted above and would record the following points:
1. Having inspected our Works and the surrounding installatons and not having found any cause
of our making, our report was raised simply to identify possible sources of the root cause;
2. Our initial report on the root cause of the flood was issued to you over two weeks ago: to
some extent this is, as you say, a statement of opinion but we are under no obligation to
provide anything further. To date nothing has been issued to us that sets a cont ra ry position;
3. It has been stated that you would issue your review of our report, but at t he time of writing
this is still await ed;
4. Given that the root cause of the flooding does not arise from any act or omission of the
Contractor; and given that we had warned of possible insufficiency in site-wide storm-water
disposal provision; and given t hat nothing tangible was done by ADAC or Aecom to act
prudently as required under the Contract: then such an event can be said to constitute an act
of Gross Negligence as defined under the Contract and any indemnity offered by Sub-Clause
24.1.1 is thereby extinguished;
5. Similarly as the root ca use is not of our making, t hen Sub-Cla use 24.2.2 to which you refer
cannot be relevant. The obligation to 'ca re for the Works', on its widest interpretation, does
not extend to an obligation to remedy damage caused by faulty design. TCA JV is not
responsible for the design of the storm-water system and there is nothing in Clause 24 that
transfers design liability to TCA JV or renders TCA JV liable for insuring against design errors.
We have covered the manner in which we believe the project should jointly move forward in the urgent
rectification of this damage in separate emails and discussions and suggest that your efforts be more
focused on cooperative endeavour to this end. We shall continue to urge that in parallel you issue both
your detailed response to our initial report and your own hydraulic investigations, as this data has been
requested by the insurer for his information.
Yours faithfully,
