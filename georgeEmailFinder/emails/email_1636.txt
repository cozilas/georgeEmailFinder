Dear Sir,

The Consultant is hereby instructed to proceed with the implementation of the Engineer's Instruction
(E.1.) nc.86 regarding changes in the design of the entrance 1.2 at Bin Mahmoud Station as detailed in
the enclosed letters under reference 1).

However, since this matter has already been instructed pursuant to Sub-Clause 4.6 [Variations and
Adjustments] of the Agreement under letter reference 2), this instruction does not have any further
impact on the Consultant's design development.

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.
Yours faithfully,
