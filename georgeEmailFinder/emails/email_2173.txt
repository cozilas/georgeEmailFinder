Dear Sir,

The Engineer's Assistant refers to letter reference 1), wherein the Contractor was directed to submit a
quotation for any cost or time impact and subsequently reminded by reference 2) and 4). Although the
Contractor failed to respond with a quotation, Engineer's Instruction reference 5) was issued containing
the same request which was again delayed. The last reminder, reference 6), followed and was due by 29
August 2016.

The Engineer's Assistant must now conclude that the Contractor is unwilling to provide the Instructed
quotation given that a totalperiod of 230 days have lapsed without submission of a quotation.

Absent compliance with the Engineer's direction and later Instruction to provide a quotation, the
Engineer is now co palled to complete his assessment of the Variation without input from the
Contractor.

Yours faithfully,
