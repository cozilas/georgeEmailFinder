Dear Sir,

Engineer's Assistant notes Contractor's continuous failure to timely fulfil its contractual obligations as
requested in the letters referenced 1 and 4.

The fact that Engineer's Instruction No.89 was issued, does not release the Contractor from respecting
the provisions of Sub Clause 13.2.1 of Volume 3 of the General Conditions of the Contract. Currently
Contractor is more than 200 days delayed with this request which is unacceptable.

Moreover the information required in the letter referenced 5 is overdue since 21 March 2016.

Therefo e the Engineer's Assistant is hereby requesting the Contractor to submit the requested
information with no urther delay.

Yours faithfully,
