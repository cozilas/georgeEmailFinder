Dear Sir,

In response to your previous letter reference 1, the Contractor presented his mitigation plan for the
excavation works on 29 March 2015 to Engineer's Assistant.

The Contractor showed in the presentation that the excavation of the top soil and removal of the
previously diverted utilities removal (by the Employer) had directly impacted on the slow progress of the
excavation works. The Contractor mobilized 18 number of excavators to site and the number of disposal
trucks has been increased to manage the planned quantity. The Contractor has achieved the planned
progress of the excavation rates for the last seven days.

This is not a material delay in relation to the critical path and can be managed by a number of mitigation
measures including but not necessarily limited to, 21 days float and those measures open to the
Contractor and contemplated under Clause 8.

Yours faithfully,
