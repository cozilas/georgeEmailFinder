With reference to the above subject, we write to inform you about the extremely serious accident,

Fortunately, yet coincidentally, there were no injuries to anyone working at the area where the incident
took place, since many of our workers were working at the same location, fixing the reinforcement for
the intermediate slab beams.
With this letter, we wish to express our serious concern regarding this extremely dangerous incident and
to request you to issue a formal investigation report accordingly, in order to understand the root cause
of this incident.
We put on record that the works were suspended from 13:20 to 16:15 PM, after which from 16:15 PM
onwards, a permission was given to work only at North-West and the South area, wherein a limited
amount of people (i.e. 10 workers) are able to work at these areas. We also note that due to this
incident, numerous workers have not reported to work today 17 January 2021. As a result, kindly be
informed that any delays arising from this matter will not be our responsibility.
Moreover, we kindly request you to officially inform us about the root cause of this incident as
mentioned above, and confirm what mitigation measures are put in place to avoid similar incidents in
the future. This is not only required to ensure that there is no reoccurrence of such incidents in the
future, but it will also be used to inform our workers that all safety issues have been resolved and all
precautions have been put in place to protect the workers.
We trust the above clarifies the matter and you will take all necessary actions accordingly.
Yours faithfully,
