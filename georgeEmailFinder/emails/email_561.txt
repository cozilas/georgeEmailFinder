Subject: WMS Neglect To Finalize An Edi As Basic Version, To Include Bim Activities In
Their Program And To Submit Appropriate Models For Coordination
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to the above subject and further to our numerous transmittals and emails but
not limited to the below, we express our concerns regarding your failure to fulfil your Subcontract
requirements in regards to BIM deliverables and implementation plan in a timely manner.
Reference is made to herunder transmittals and project specification 019800, we would like to
emphasize
on the terms of your progress evaluation that should meet in full I compliance with:
I. An agreed version of EDI as version 01 (with a sample model LOD 400, tagged & MTO), according
to the BIM Implementation Plan (page 4, paragr.4):
"The digital form of the 81M submissions, its contents (geometrical and alphanumeric), necessary file
formats, software requirements, data , attributes, etc., will be provided to the Sub-Contractor after

execution within an agreement outlined in an ED/ {Electronic Data Interface) procedure prior to the
start of coordination or 8/M development.)"
II. BIM activities (LOD300, 400, 500) to be included in your program.
Ill. The models which are going to be evaluated (assessed) should be submitted with official
transmittal. So far you have not provided appropriate models of steel platforms for coordination
among other trades (TCAJV has been issued two clash reports INT-BIM-5560 & 5561). Moreover
you have not submitted models of Linen Chutes.
On top of that you have submitted shop drawings and still it is pending by your side the submission of
models and after appropriate coordination period to become fully coordinated as LOD 400, kindly
review
the transmittaiiNT-BIM-3863; which you got since 5th August. In this document in item 6 it is mentioned
that "The extraction of the 2D shop drawings and or fabrication drawings {for construction purposes)
must
be completed from the approved LOD 400 8/M model.".
Therefore you are kindly urged to finalize the above prerequisites regarding the EDI finalization, the BIM
activities, and the submission of models for the coordination among other trades within 10 days from
receipt of this letter.
