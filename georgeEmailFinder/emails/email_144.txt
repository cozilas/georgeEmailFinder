Subject:Rejection of Additional Works: Verification Boreholes and Grouting
Dear Sirs,
We refer to the above referenced e-mails (copies attached) concerning the following matters:
1.
RHDHV e-mail: 12 February 2020 relates to VBH suggestions for Sewer Line 2301 to LS22;
2.
RHDHV e-mail: 17 February 2020 concerns additional verification SPT boreholes S2304 – S2305;
3.
RHDHV e-mail: 24 February 2020 associated with additional verification borehole to HM2301;
and
4.
ADAC e-mail: 5 February 2020 relates to additional grouting to areas LS22 – 2301.
All of the above referenced e-mails point to the requirement for us to undertake additional works;
which we hasten to add, are to areas where our remediation works have already been completed and
signed off by you. Moreover, the additional work has yet to be formally instructed by you. Therefore
until such time as you issue us the requisite Engineer’s Instructions directing us to undertake the
additional works, we are not obliged to undertake the same. Nor are we obliged to expend monies on
what is transpiring to be a ‘trial and error’ empirical method of design. Therefore we will not be

entertaining any of the additional requirements described in and/or attached to the above noted emails. Any further work will cause us to revert to SAA8 i.e. ROM then a Variation instruction.
Yours faithfully,
