Subject SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No.0170 Delays to processing re-entry permit/NOCs
and activities of Others affect)ng finalization of snagging, de-snagging and T&C
activities
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence (1) received from the Contractor regarding the alleged
delay in the processing of re-entry permits and NOCs.
We note that these rooms should have been completed as part of Milestones MS06A and MS06B in 31
December 2018 and 28 February 2019 respectively. The Contractor has failed to achieve these
Milestones within their contractual Completion Date and the rooms to date remain incomplete due to
the Contractor's own delays.
The Engineer has processed more than 600 re-entry permits to the tenant spaces to accommodate the
activities of the Contractor when these areas should have been provided with uninterrupted access to
the Tenant Fit Out Contractors. There is no visibility when the Contractor will finalize their base build
works and this affects not only the works of the Tenant Contractors but also the Testing and
Commissioning (T&C) activities.
As a result of the Contractor's re-entry to these spaces, disruption has been caused to the works of the
Employer's Other Contractors for which the Contractor shall be held responsible. The Contractor is
requested to provide their plan on when the base build works will be completed in these areas in
order to achieve undisturbed and uninterrupted access to the Tenant Contractors.
In light of the above, we do not consider that the submitted E-Notice has any merit and we hereby
reserve the Employer's rights for any further delays to the Project associated with the Contract or's
failure to achieve Milestones MS06A and MS06B within their contractual Completion Date.
Yours faithfully,
