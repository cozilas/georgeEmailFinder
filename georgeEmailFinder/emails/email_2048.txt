Dear Sir,

Further to the receipt of the Engineer’s Assistant’s e-mail of reference 1) it is hereby noted that the
unofficial instruction contained therein imposes additional and / or abortive design work on account of
changing the tunnel fire suppression QCDD DC2 drawing reference numbers and necessitating the
resubmission of same.

As evidenced in the e-mail correspondence enclosed herewith, the Employer has requested the said
submissions to refer back to the “original account and reference number” and hence the application
number needs to revert back to "N/2017/0000069". Moreover, to allow those additional design works
to proceed the Contractor has no option other than to issue an instruction to WorleyParsons who in
turn will only progress with the abortive design works subject to the approval of its respective Scope
Change Order (SCO).

To avoid any unnecessary delays therefore, the Engineer’s Assistant is kindly requested to issue an
Instruction pursuant to Clause 13 [Variations and Adjustments] within seven (7) days from receipt of this
letter.

Yours faithfully,
