Delays to Automated Tray Return System (ATRS) Testing - Overdue Responses to Document
Submittal Nos. DS/0401/13480 Rev. 02 (Smart View Matrix SAT Protocol) and DS/0401/14184 Rev. 01
(ATRS Performance Test Document)

Dear Sir
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and / or circumstances described herein
may cause delay and/or disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.
The Event(s):
On 5 and 6 May 2019, we in conjunction with the specialist Automated Tray Return System (ATRS)
package subcontractor, MacDonald Humfrey Automation (‘MHA’), submitted the following Document
Submittals, requesting for your review and approval of (1) the ATRS Smart View Matrix SAT Protocol and
(2) the ATRS Performance Test Document appended thereto (refer to Table 1 below).

Article 1.3 of Specification Section 013300 ‘Submittal Procedures’ governs the processing time by which
you are contractually obligated to respond to our submittals. For example, on the basis that Document
Submittal No: DS/0401/14184 is at Rev 01 then this ought to have been responded to by you 14
calendar days later, i.e. on 20 May 2019. However the information recorded in Table 1 shows that you
exceeded the review period expressly stated in the Contract by 35 calendar days.
In other words, you have had Document Submittal No: DS/0401/14184-01 in your possession for 49
calendar days. Consequentially, the delayed approval of the ATRS Performance Test Document has
similarly delayed MacDonald Humfrey Automation from carrying out the ATRS Performance Test – their
letter dated 10 June 2016 referenced (4) [copy attached], is synonymous with this very matter.
As for Document Submittal No: DS/0401/13480, which is at Rev. 02, Table 1 shows that you exceeded
the seven (7) calendar day review period expressly stated in the Contract by a 15 calendar days.
MacDonald Humfrey Automation wrote on this also, both in letter refs: (4) and (3) [attached].
Potential Impact:
As noted, the delayed response to Document Submittal No: DS/0401/14184-01 has directly impacted
MacDonald Humfrey Automation’s ability to undertake the ATRS Performance Test; and without doubt,
the late response to DS/0401/13480-02 has contributed in delaying the testing also, and given that the
ATRS system is an essential and fundamental aspect of the Airport Operational Systems will impact on
our ability to achieve Milestone MS09B and will invariably knock on to Milestone MS09C.
Action Required:
Ordinarily we would be requesting you prompt action, guidance or decision as may be applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
However as the responses to Document Submittal Refs: DS/0401/13480 Rev. 02 and DS/0401/14184-01
have been received, there is no action on your part. The potential for delay remains however.
As such, we reserve all our rights under the provisions of Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and
27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to the Time for
Completion and any associated costs due to the event(s) and circumstances described herein.
Yours faithfully,
