Dear Sir,

The Contractor is writing with reference to the ongoing flooding situation at Souq Waqif station.

On the 251h of August 2015, a fountain of water appeared and caused severe flooding in the excavated
area of the aforementioned station. This flooding has been brought under control by the introduction of
3 heavy duty water pumps and installation of a separate discharge system, as the current system did not
have the capacity required. Further enhancement of the dewatering system is ongoing. Initial remedial
measures such as specialized grouting by sodium silicate and steel TAM tubes have been taken to
reduce the excessive inflow of water. This situation will have an impact on both time and cost to the
project.

A geophysical survey has been conducted and the results must be analyzed before further steps can be
taken.

The Contractor hereby by gives notice of the delay as per clause 8.4.2 and notice of claim as per clause
20.1.2 of volume 3 - Conditions of Contract.

Yours faithfully,
