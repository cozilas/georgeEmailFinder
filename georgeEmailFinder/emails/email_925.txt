Dear Sir,
With reference to the Engineer's reply to RFI 11594 wherein the Design Consultant requested
coordinated
layouts/plans to be reviewed with ADM for sign-off, please refer to the attached drawings signed by
ADM
showing the locations of the clean-outs.
We note that the additional cleanouts due to the offset in the riser routing (point #2 of the RFI) are not
shown in the latest or previous revisions of the relevant IFC plans (refer to attachments).
We consic{er the Engineer has issued instructions constituting a Variation which are not in the form of,
or
which have not been confirmed in writing by the Engineer by way of a formal Variation Order.
In accordance with Conditions of Contract (COC) clause 20.1.4 (b), please provide a formal confirmation
of
Variation or issue an Engineer's instruction and revised Drawings and/or Specification pursuant to COC
11.3.3. and 20.1.1 (a).
In the event the Engineer does not take the above Contract required actions then in accordance with
COC
clause 20.1.5 the Contractor would not be able to proceed with the implementation of the above
described Variation. Should this materialise then the Employer shall be solely responsible for all
consequential impacts due to late or untimely confirmations.
Kindly be guided accordingly.
Yours faithfully,
