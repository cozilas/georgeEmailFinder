Dear Sir,

achieved. Kindly note that these works should be completed by 30th of September 2018 and as per your

In light of the above failures, please be advised that we will be appointing third parties on your behalf to

relevant cost incurred by such third parties will be your responsibility and recovered from your account
accordingly.
Moreover, you are reminded of your obligations as set out under the Subcontract Clause 8.1.2

This is for your utmost attention and immediate action.
Yours faithfully,
