Subject: RE: Engineer's Position for Reversal of VE Struct 09- Replacement of Curved
Dear Sir,
Plate Secondary Girders with Trusses- Central processor Roof Steelwork
The Contractor acknowledges receipt of Engineer letter ref (1) and responds as follows:
At the outset, the Contractor records it disagreement with the statement of the Engineer that "The
Contract Price and the scope of the Works includes therein a Value Engineering Item referenced as VE
Struct 09 being a proposal by the Contractor to substitute the secondary roof girders to the Central
Processor roof with tri-chord trusses in lieu of curved plate girders." (Emphasis added). The Value
Engineering (VE) Item ref VE Struct 09 was initiated, proposed and introduced by the Employer during
the
Best and Final offer (BAFO) stage during Tender (see letter ref 3 confirming this).
Furthermore, the Contractor rejects the following statement of the Engineer in letter ref (1}" During the
design development in October 2012 a decision was agreed between the Employer's Design Consultant
and
the Contractor's Sub-consultant to adopt a two chord truss except for the edge details which would
utilize
a faceted plate girder system." The Contractor asserts that any reference to the attendance of the
Contractor, Subcontractor or Contractor's Sub-consultants at any VE design development meetings for
VE
Struct 09 is irrelevant. The Contractor only attended those VE design development meetings in good
faith

to assist the Employer's design Consultants. Pursuant to clause 9.7.1 of the Contract, the Employer
(through its design Consultants) was entirely responsible for the design development ofVE Struct 09.
The Contractor has reviewed the Engineer's assessment and does not agree with it. The Contractor
maintains its position as submitted via RFVO ref (4).
Yours faithfully,
