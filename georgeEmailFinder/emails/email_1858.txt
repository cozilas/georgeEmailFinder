Dear Sir,
This is an instruction under Sub-Clause 13.1.1 of the General Conditions of Contract to initiate and
execute
a variation.The nature and extent of the variation is provided below. The fo l owi ng Employer's Requi
rement:
Volume 6, Section 13, Figure E1: Station Power Systems Block Diagram - Scope Demarcation:to be
deleted.

Volume 6, Section 13, Sub-section 13.3.4.4 (f}: Stand-by Diesel Generators - to be deleted.

Volume 6, Section 14 (Electrical & Mechanical Room Requirements) - are to be amended to remove
Diesel Generators and Tanks as follows:

Figure E.1: Station Power Systems Block Diagram - Scope Demarcation - to be added.

Diesel Generators and Tanks are deleted from the metro stations as Qatar Rail's multiple redundancies
in the power supply system are by means of two Station Power Supply Substations (SPS) at either site of
a metro station. At this level there is 100% SPS redundancy. If SPS 1 fails, SPS 2 can provide the full load.
The room allocation for the Diesel Generators (70 m2) is to remain for Systems use. The room allocation
for
Diesel Tanks (30 m2) is to be utilized by the Civil Works Contractors.
Yours faithfully,
