Subject:Post SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0131
Unreasonable WIR Code 3 Comments Rejecting the Mock-up for XD1 Lighting Fixtures requesting
changes to the Ceiling Roses and GI Boxes
Dear Sirs,
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
The matters described in Annex A concern delays to the Works due to your unreasonable Status Code 3
comments issued in response to WIR-ELEC-66175-Z, rejecting the Mock-up for Type XD1 Lighting
Fixtures and insisting upon unfounded changes to the Ceiling Roses [regarding the IP Rating].
Potential Impact

Delays and disruption due to the events and circumstances outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
likely to impact on the achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delays and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned immediately upon receipt of this e-notice.
Nevertheless, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
In or about August 2019, we submitted Work Inspection Request (WIR) Ref: ELEC-66175-Z requesting
the final inspection and approval for the Mock-up installation of Lighting Fixture Type XD1 at CSP L0.0
External area 5.26 D. You returned WIR Ref: ELEC-66175-Z classified Status Code 3 ‘Revise & Resubmit’
on 21 August 2019; the primary basis of which is reflected by the following comment:
‘The installation of the GI boxes with the related ceiling roses is not complying with the IP rating
requirements for the external installations, the Contractor to rectify this installation and to reflect any
changes in an approved RLM drawings [sic] prior resubmitting this WIR.’
For the reasons outlined as follows, it is our contention that this comment [and hence the Status Code 3
rejection of WIR ref ELEC-66175-Z] is not only unreasonable but totally unfounded.
The installation detail of Lighting Fixture Type XD1 [as shown on inter alia Shop Drawing No: 401-AN-E07-GE-0.00-LT-SD-110] consists of various components; including without limitation the following:
1.
Lighting Fixture Type XD1; and
2.
Ceiling Rose.
In relation to the Lighting Fixture Type XD1, we acknowledge that as per Specification Section 265120
(‘Architectural Front of House Lighting’) the IP [Ingress Protection] requirement for the ‘Ceiling recessed
fixed downlight’ (Lighting Fixture Type XD1) is shown to be ‘IP66’, which essentially means that the Type
XD1 Lighting Fixture is weatherproof (i.e. watertight, waterproof and dustproof). However, Specification
Section 265120 fails to provide any information that defines the Ceiling Rose IP rating; neither does it
provide information or any cross references in support of any requirement for the Ceiling Rose to be IP
rated. If you had any concern on the IP rating of the Ceiling Rose, or you wished to instigate changes to
the Installation Detail of Lighting Fixture Type XD1, then you had every opportunity in advising us prior
to releasing the response to WIR ref ELEC-66175-Z on 21 August 2019. One such opportunity was in
response to the Ceiling Rose Material Submittals.
Specifically, on 21 January 2014 we issued Material Submittal No. MS/0401/E/0097 Rev. 00 seeking your
review and approval of the Ceiling Rose; which you responded to on 17 February 2014 albeit endorsed
Status Code 4 ‘rejected’; on the grounds the material was to match the raceway material. This was
subsequently followed by the submission on 7 April 2014 of a revised submittal, namely Material
Submittal No. MS/0401/E/0123 Rev. 00, which was returned Status Code 2 on 30 April 2014. Details
pertaining to the submission and responses to both submittals are shown in Table 1 below.
This demonstrates to us that you had every opportunity to raise any concerns on the Ceiling Rose IP
rating in 2014; not only on one occasion, but on two separate occasions but you failed to do so.

‘Exceptions as Noted. Revise & Resubmit for Record’
As noted in Table 1, you responded to MS/0401/E/0123 on 30 April 2014 classifying our revised
Submittal for the Ceiling Rose as Status Code 2 together the following comment [emphasis added]:
“Code 2 - We take no exceptions to proposed material. Comply [with Abu Dhabi Wiring Regulations]
ADWR regulations and install as per approved shopdrawing details. Ceiling Rose where exposed to view
should be white (RAL9016).”
Our shop drawing for the installation of Lighting Fixture Type XD1 i.e. Shop Drawing No: 401-AN-E-07GE-0.00-LT-SD-110 Rev 01, was issued to you on 8 August 2018 vide Shop Drawing Submittal Ref:
SDS/0401/E/1099 Rev. 01, which you returned Status Code 2 on 20 August 2018 (refer to Table 2).

Code 2 ‘Exceptions as Noted. Revise & Resubmit for Record’
As per the approved Shop Drawing, the installation of XD1 Lights (IP rated) shows the Ceiling Roses, GI
Boxes and Driver Ballasts (refer to Figure 1 below) [all of which are non IP rated devices] mounted to the
lighting tray, with no comments annotated thereupon concerning the IP rating of the devices.
Figure 1 – Installation detail of Lighting Fixture Type XD1
Extract from Shop Drawing No. 401-AN-E-07-GE-0.00-LT-SD-110 Rev. 01
We proceeded to “install ... [Lighting Fixture Type XD1, Ceiling Roses, GI Boxes and Driver Ballasts] … as
per approved shopdrawing details” in their intended locations on site in accordance with your
comments issued in reply to SDS/0401/E/1099 Rev. 01. Given that the lighting detail complies with the
Contract requirements based on the Design information supplied by you (i.e. IFC Drawings and
Specifications), and Material and Shop Drawings Submittals approved by you, we are appreciably
perturbed to now be informed that “the related ceiling roses is [allegedly] not complying with the IP
rating requirements for external installations…”; and that you require them to be ‘rectified’.
Your Status Code 3 commented response to (WIR) Ref: ELEC-66175-Z was issued on 21 August 2019. This
is one year after you approved Shop Drawing No: 401-AN-E-07-GE-0.00-LT-SD-110 Rev. 01 (Table 2
refers), and five+ years after you approved MS/0401/E/0123 Rev. 00 (refer to Table 1).
In view of the various circumstances summarised above, your comments are not only mistimed, but
unreasonable and without merit. You have also failed to take cognisance of the ramifications on the
project if you insist on instigating any changes – particularly at such a late stage of the Project.
Specifically, should you require IP rated requirements, then all of the Ceiling Roses [of which there are
100s] will have to be replaced with IP rated boxes with terminal blocks inside. In addition, all of the
Driver Ballasts will have to be encased in IP rated boxes to ensure consistency. In this regard we note
that the ‘Dimming & Type’ of the Driver Ballasts as per Specification Section 265120, is identified to be
‘Dali and remote’ respectively. Hence, the Ballasts will also have to be replaced as per your requests
and must be separated/remote from the rest of the devices as indicated in the Specification.
Consequently, we record that your comments affect hundreds of installed Ceiling Roses, GI boxes and
Driver Ballasts at numerous locations in the Project, all of which would require replacing. This is
notwithstanding the immense amount of disruption that would be caused to completed works.
In order for us to undertake and instigate changes such as those noted herein, we will require fully
coordinated revised IFC Drawings encapsulating the changes introduced in your WIR response, and
further remind you that SAA8 laid down mandatory procedures to be followed if additional works are
required, in so far as an EI and VO are needed for us to proceed with the aforementioned changes.

The provisions of Clauses 2.29 to 2.31 of SAA8’ pertaining to Variations are clear; we are not to proceed
with any Variation unless a Variation Order and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. In which
respect, it is your obligation to issue this Record first if you wish to instigate change; this is only after the
additional time and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.
Therefore, until such time as you take the action required of you in accordance with SAA8 Clause 2.29,
we are unable to proceed with implementing the changes noted above and will continue to proceed in
accordance with the existing IFC design to the extent we are able to. We trust this is clear.
Meanwhile, give the unreasonable nature of your Status Code 3 comments issued in response to WIR
Ref: ELEC-66175-Z, we request that you immediately re-code it to a minimum of Status Code 2.
Yours faithfully,
