Dear Sir,

Further to the Notice of claim for Claim No. 034 at reference 1above, the Contractor respectfully
requests the Engineer's written agreement to an extension of 1 month to the current contractual
submission date for the Claim of 29 October 2015.

The reason for this extension request is to enable the initial Claim No. 034 submission to be reasonably
quantified within the extension period. The SAP drawings have resulted in changes to each and every
station which will take some time to identify the full impact. The granting of this extension will also give
us time to respond to the request for further clarifications on Claim Numbers 002-010 inclusive and 017,
hence the Contractor will commit to providing this response by the 19th of October 2015 .
The Contractor would appreciate a prompt written response to this extension request by the date stated
below. Yours faithfully,
