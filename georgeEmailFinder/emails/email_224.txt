Subject: Rejection of CIR Submissions
Dear Sirs,
We write to express our concern at your rejection of 316 number CIR submissions made du ring week
51, at a time when all other stakeholders are making concerted efforts towards meeting the
Completion Plan Cause and Effect dates. This number represents nearly 80% of all such submissions
made in that week.
The reason given, that these are not 'in line with delivery plan' is contractually incorrect and in the
circumstances unacceptable, representing a clear prevention event for which we hereby give notice
in accordance with Contract Clause 27.1.1.
These 316 CIRs will be resubmitted and we request that sufficient resources are made available to
properly review these as a matter of urgency, in an effort to recover the delay caused by this '
rejection.
Yours faithfully,
