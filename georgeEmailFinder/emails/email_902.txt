Re: Incident Report for Damaged Sign – ANEL’s response

Dear Sir,
Further to your letter referenced in (2) above, please find enclosed response we have received from M/S
ANEL reference in (5) above which is self-explanatory.
Pursuant to the conditions of Subcontract Clauses -15.6.2, 24.2.1 & 24.2.2., you are hereby reminded of
your obligation under the Subcontract to protect the works until such a time as ownership of the same
transfers to the Employer upon the issuance of the Taking Over Certificate (TOC).
In case, you wish to pursue a claim against another Subcontractor, the onus is on you to provide correct
particulars in the form of substantiation/ evidence of the damage. In this regard you have failed to
demonstrate as such hence you are liable for your negligence.
This is for your information and record.
Yours faithfully,
