submitted vide SDS/0401/C/0383-01 – Depth of Grout Points above the Diaphragm Wall for Pier 2 –
Failure to Re-Code Shop Drawings
Dear Sirs,
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
The matters described in Annex A concern delays to the Time for Completion of the Works due to the
unreasonable Code 3 comments issued in response to six out of fourteen Shop Drawings issued vide
SDS/0401/C/0383-01 for Drilling Depth of Grout Points above the Diaphragm Wall for Pier 2; and your
subsequent failure to re-code the affected Shop Drawings despite our request issued on 5 January 2020.
Potential Impact
Delays and disruption due to the events and circumstances outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
likely to impact on the achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delays and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned immediately upon receipt of this e-notice.
Nevertheless, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
Background
In the period between 17 July 2019 and 27 November 2019, we submitted a total of one hundred and
fifteen (115) Grouting Layout Shop Drawings [including revisions] under cover of a total of twenty-five
(25) corresponding Shop Drawing Submittals, in the manner recorded in Annex A1 hereto.

We remind you that Article 1.3 of Specification Section 013300 ‘Submittal Procedures’ governs the
processing time by which you are contractually obligated to respond to our submittals. On the basis that
each of the Shop Drawings Submittals set out in Annex A1 are shown to be between Rev. 00 and Rev. 2
and higher, then they ought to have been responded to by you 21, 14 and 7 calendar days later. Even
though all the submittals have been responded to, we note your responses were returned up to 57
calendar days later than the review period expressly stipulated in Specification Section 013300.
SDS/0401/C/0383 Rev-00
The twenty-five (25) Submittals introduced above, included SDS/0401/C/0383 Rev-00 submitted on 15
October 2019 requesting approval of fourteen (14) Shop Drawings, associated with the drilling depth of
grout points above the diaphragm wall located at Pier 2, albeit of the Shop Drawings are entitled ‘Airside
Civil Work Soil Improvements grouting Layout Plan For Sewer Manhole & Pipe at Pier 2’.
All fourteen (14) Shop Drawings issued under SDS/0401/C/0383 Rev-00 were subsequently approved by
you / NACO classified as Status Code-2 on 7 November 2019. It is important to stress at this juncture
that no comments were made by you / NACO regarding the drilling depth of the grout points above the
diaphragm wall. As a result, the works commenced on site and the drilling of the grout points was
undertaken in accordance with the approved grout points reflected upon the approved Shop Drawings.
SDS/0401/C/0383 Rev-01
Further to which, we proceeded with updating our Shop Drawings taking cognisance of the omitted
grout points around the crossing services and earth pits as agreed during our meetings / discussions
based on Bulletin 262.2. These were submitted for your approval on 27 November 2019 vide Shop
Drawing Submittal No. SDS/0401/C/0383 Rev. 01. You subsequently responded on 30 December 2019.
However, out of the fourteen (14) Shop Drawings we submitted, eight (8) were returned Status Code 2,
while the remaining six (6), were classified Status Code-3. The affected Shop Drawings are:
1.
Shop Drawing No. 401-JV-C-09-SR-8.00-TSEX-SD-018 Rev. 00
2.
Shop Drawing No. 401-JV-C-09-SR-8.21-TSEX-SD-001 Rev. 00
3.
Shop Drawing No. 401-JV-C-09-SR-8.21-TSEX-SD-002 Rev. 00
4.
Shop Drawing No. 401-JV-C-09-SR-8.21-TSEX-SD-003 Rev. 00
5.
Shop Drawing No. 401-JV-C-09-SR-8.22-TSEX-SD-001 Rev. 00
6.
Shop Drawing No. 401-JV-C-09-SR-8.50-TSEX-SD-006 Rev. 00
We note that the above Shop Drawings had been rejected on the basis of the following comment
annotated thereupon (reproduced in Figure 1 bellow) relating to the drilling depth on the top of the
diaphragm wall.
Figure 1 – Status Code 3 Comments Issued in Response to
Shop Drawing Nos. 401-JV-C-09-SR-8.00-TSEX-SD-018 Rev. 00, 8.21-TSEX-SD-001 Rev. 00, 8.21-TSEX-SD002 Rev. 00, 8.21-TSEX-SD-003, Rev 00, 822-TSEX-SD-001 Rev.00 and 8.50-TSEX-SD-006 Rev. 00
However, considering the fact that the exact same Drilling Depths listed as “Drilling Depth from Ground
Level (+17.9m)” were previously included in all fourteen (14) of the Shop Drawings submitted to you
vide SDS/0401/C/0383 Rev. 00 and had been approved Status Code 2, we consider the Status Code 3
rejection comments reproduced in Figure 1 above, are unreasonable. Unfortunately, this issue has now
developed into a more complex matter, since the drilling works have been completed on site by us,
based on the ‘Drilling Depths’ previously approved by you / NACO as per SDS/0401/C/0383 Rev. 00.
In addition, we also note that prior to issuing SDS/0401/C/0383 Rev 00 and SDS/0401/C/0383 Rev 01,
we raised RFI/0401/17238 on 25 June 2019 seeking a clear direction from you / NACO regarding the
located / clash point on top of the diaphragm wall, in the manner shown in Figure 2 below.
Figure 2 – Submitted RFI/0401/17238

We requested a response to RFI/0401/17238 by 2 July 2019. However, you failed to responded until 15
calendar days later on 17 July 2019. Notwithstanding the prolonged period taken by you in providing a
reply, the Employer’s Design Consultant (KFP) advised of the following (refer to Figure 3):
Figure 3 – KPF’s Response to RFI/0401/17238
Interestingly, none of the comments provided by KPF in response to RFI/0401/17238 reproduced in
Figure 3, mentioned converting the grout points on top of the diaphragm wall, to be vertical; which has
since been suggested in the Status Code 3 comments responding to SDS/0401/C/0383 Rev 01.
We further record that attached to RFI/0401/17238 were a series of IFC Drawings which have been
previously revised in many Bulletins, clearly indicating that the grout points shall be terminated 500mm
above the pile caps and the existing structures; all of which have been followed to identify the required
drilling depth on top of the diaphragm wall, since it is an existing underground structure.
In addition, we would like to draw you attention, to the diaphragm wall which is located all around the
perimeter of the Central Processor (CP) building, not only at Pier 2, and note that all shopdrawings for
other Piers i.e. P3 and P4 have not been commented in the same manner as per your SDS/0401/C/0383
Rev-01 comments, regarding the drilling depth on top of the diaphragm wall.
Accordingly, the grout works to Pier 2 have been completed based on the approved Shop Drawings and
after of circa two (2) months of construction works, most of the grout points have been completed.
In view of the above, we remind you that it is the Employer’s Design Consultant responsibility to provide
a clear direction in regards to any changes to the grout points type (either vertical or inclined), not the
‘Contractor’ as alluded to in the Code 3 comments annotated on the 14 rejected Shop Drawings vide
SDS/0401/C/0383 Rev-01 (see Figure 1) and in response to RFI/0401/17238 (see Figure 3 above).
In this regard, and as advised many times previously, we reiterate that we are not the designers for this
Project, the Employer’s Design Consultant is. Consequently, we accept no liability or responsibility for
any inconsistencies in the Design; neither do we accept any responsibility for overcoming any
inconsistencies in the Design; this remains firmly with the Employer’s Design Consultant.
Therefore, in view of the events and circumstances outlined above and also explained within our email
dated 5 January 2020 [Sunday 10:32 AM] a copy of which is attached at Annex A2 hereto, we maintain
that the Status Code 3 comments annotated on six (6) out of the fourteen (14) Shop Drawings attached
to the response to Shop Drawing Submittal No. SDS/0401/C/0383 Rev-01, are unreasonable. Despite
urging you by way of our e-mail issued four months ago on 5 January 2020, to re-code the affected Shop
Drawings, you failed to do so. In fact, you failed to provide any reply to our e-mail. Accordingly we urge
you once again to immediately re-code the six Shop Drawings to a minimum of Status Code 2.
However, in the event you wish to instigate changes to the grouting points and drilling depth on top of
the diaphragm wall in the manner suggested in your response to SDS/0401/C/0383 Rev-01, you will
need to issue an Engineer’s Instruction accompanied by revised IFC Drawings reflecting such change.
This is on the basis that SAA8 laid down strict guidelines to follow if additional works are required and
this change / additional variation works will warrant issuance of a valid Engineer’s Instruction (EI) and a
Variation Order (VO) if you require us to proceed with integrating the revised scope into the Works.
Moreover, the express provisions of Clauses 2.29 to 2.31 of SAA8 are patently clear: We are not to
proceed with any Variation unless a Variation Order and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first.
Therefore, until such time as you take the necessary action required of you in accordance with the
provisions of SAA8 Clause 2.29, we are unable to proceed with implementing the changes noted above
and will continue to proceed in accordance with the existing IFC design to the extent we are able to.
Yours faithfully,
