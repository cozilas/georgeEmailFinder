Dear Sir,

Further to your quotation referenced 1) above, Engineer's Assistant (EA) notes that you have included
within this quotation additional costs in connection with Jet Fan requirements as a result of interface
with MSI.

The EA considers that all costs in connection with Jet Fan requirements should be excluded from the
costs resulting from the Engineer's Instruction referenced 2), as the two issues are considered separate.
The Contractor is requested to revise and re-submit the quotation taking the above into consideration.
Yours faithfully,
