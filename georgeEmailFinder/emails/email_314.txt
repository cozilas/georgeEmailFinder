Subject Contractor's Claim for an Extension of the Time for Completion for events between 4
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence (1) wherein the Contractor responded to the Engineer's
assessment and disapproval of the Contractor's claim.
It is the Engineer's determination that the Contractor's response does not address the issues raised by
the Engineer regarding the deficiencies related to the Contractor's cla im (3) and thus the Engineer's
disapproval of the claim pursuant to Clause 27.1.6 of the Conditions of Contract remains.
Should the Contractor object, then the Contractor shall fol low the process described in Clause 27.1.6
with regard to the Dispute Resolution.
Yours faithfully,
