Dear Sir,

The scope of works of Tender Plan of reference 1) relating to Ooredoo cable diversions in Al Sadd has
been evaluated as either:
a)

Covered by Tender Plan of reference 3.

b)

Omitted as part of the deletion of Entrance 4) in Al Sadd

Furthermore the scope of works of Tender Plan reference 1) relating to QAF cable diversions has
considerably changed issue of a change in the construction methodology as announced vide letter
reference 2).

Therefore, as agreed informally with the Engineerâ€™s Assistant, the Contractor herewith withdraws the
Tender Plan for Utility Diversions of reference 1). The Contractor will issue a new Tender Plan M006GDB-COM-PLN-00128, to cover the remaining scope of works in relation to QAF and Kahramaa
diversions at Al Sadd Station.

Yours faithfully,
