Subject: Response to the Engineer's Notification of Delay- Air Duct System Cleaning Activity
Dear Sir,
(Final Cleaning and Cleanliness Verification)
With reference to the Engineer's notification of delay reference (1) above, we respond as follows.
The Contractor notes the content and concerns of the Engineer in the above referenced letter. The
Contractor shall investigate and discuss with the relevant Subcontractor, any delays to air duct system
cleaning activity.
Whilst the Contractor is making all sensible efforts and using reasonable endeavours to achieve the
target
dates as per the rev 10.4 Programme and the duct cleaning recovery programme, the Engineer should
appreciate that it may not always be feasible to achieve some of the ambitious targets set in these
programmes, due to unforeseen circumstances.
The Contractor however assures the Engineer and the Employer that it continues to work in good faith
to
meet the accelerated target completion date set for the completion of the Works. Finally, when
assessed
against the update of the rev 10.4 Programme as at 01 February 2018, there is no slippage with respect
to
30 June 2019 target completion, caused by the alleged delays in air duct system cleaning activity.
We trust the above clarifies your concerns.
Yours faithfully,
