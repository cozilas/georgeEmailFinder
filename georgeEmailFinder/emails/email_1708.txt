now confirms, in accordance with General Condition ("GC") 20.1.6(b) of Volume 3 of the Contract, the
following additional cost information has been collated by the Contractor to 16 June 2016 in relation to

information.

As laid out in Claim 56, reference 1, the Contractor has received FCN 073, reference 3, from the Lead
Designer, wherein the Lead Designer claims in direct consequence of the Claim Event an amount of:

QAR 14,508,742.00

The Contractor has provided to the Client FCN 073 in Appendix B of Claim 056, reference 1. The
Contractor has thoroughly evaluated the Lead Designer’s Claim and defended the Client’s interest. For
full transparency, the detailed evaluation of the Lead Designer’s FCN 073, reference 3, is provided to
client in attachment 1 to this letter.

and the progress on MEP Works to 50%. The Contractor has paid the due amounts in accordance to the
aforementioned progress and to the Contractor’s determination value, totaling:

QAR 5,172,875.47

The full particulars concerning the executed payments of the above mentioned amount is provided in
attachment 2 to this letter.

As the Claim Event giving rise to this Claim has a continuing effect and the Contractor is still collating
further
particulars, the Contractor shall be submitting further interim Claim submissions with respect to the
Claim

Event giving rise to combined Claim Nr 025 & 026 at monthly intervals as required by GC 20.1.6(b).

Yours faithfully,
