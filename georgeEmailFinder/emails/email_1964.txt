Dear Sir,

The Engineer's Assistant is in receipt of the Contractor's letter reference (1) and provides the following
clarifications:

1.
The Engineer's Assistant's request, expressed in the letter reference (2), is not to be construed
as superseding the Contractor's contractual obligation to give the notices under Sub clause 4.7.5 "no less
than 28 days" for the intended date of the commencement of each Subcontractor's/Supplier
works/supply order and for the actual date for commencement of such work/supply order accordingly.
2.
The twice - monthly transmittal referred by the Contractor in his letter reference (3) is a request
of the Engineer's Assistant as consequence of the Contractor's failure to fulfill his contractual obligation
and is not subject to Sub Clause 4.7.5 requirements.
3.
The approval dates mentioned by the Contractor at positions 2, 3, 6 and 7 are not the
contractual approval dates.
4.
All the anticipated dates do not meet the 28 days' notice requirement. Moreover the
anticipated commencement dates related to positions 3 and 5 are earlier than the Aconex transmittal
date.
The Engineer's Assistant requests again for Contractor to comply with their contractual obligations and
request a thorough status report related to all subcontractors/s uppliers that are/were involved in the
project with e phasis on the approval date, actual commencement date and the Contractor's notice date
under Sub clause .7.5 (if any) within 3 days of the receipt of this letter.

Yours faithfully,
