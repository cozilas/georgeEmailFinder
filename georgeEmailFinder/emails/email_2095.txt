Dear Sir,
The Engineer's Assistant refers to the letter reference 1) above in which the Contractor accepts the
Engineer's consideration that, cost saving should be based on tendered values with regard to the saving
resulting from the optimization of the number of Cross Passages .

With regard to 'testing and commissioning' under the scope of Lump Sum Contract Price, the Engineer's
Assista t requires the Contractor to identify and substantiate the testing and commissioning applicable
to the Tunels as well as those applicable to the Cross Passages.

Yours faithfully,
