Re: Gatehouses Lack of Closure Clearance

Dear Sir,
We write in response to your letter referenced (1) above, regarding your statements for the lack of work
fronts for Ceiling/ Wall cladding closure at the Gatehouses and we hereby respond as follows:
Your CommentsOur Response
In addition to the above, please be informed that there are enough available work-fronts for you to
proceed but you are failing to do so. The available work-front areas include but not limited to the
following:
•
Gatehouse 08 L2.0 ceiling – Framing installation has not started yet. You have been advised to
proceed since 16th May 2018;
•
Gatehouse 07 L2.0 ceiling – Framing installation has not started yet. You have been advised to
proceed since 16th May 2018;
•
At the entrance to hold room all areas in Gatehouses in Pier 1 framing for the bulk head and
corner cladding work has to start as soon as possible. We put on record that only GH 48 & 49 have been
completed out of 6 Gatehouses;
•
At the entrance to hold room all areas in Gatehouses in Pier 1 framing for the bulk head and
corner cladding work has to start as soon as possible. We put on record that only GH 7, 8, 9, 10 steel
post have been completed out of 16 Gatehouses.
We once again reiterate, as stated in numerous correspondences, that we remain increasingly
concerned regarding your delays, lack of progress and lack of manpower at site, which has not improved
despite our recurrent instructions to proceed with the works without any delay. The aforementioned
delays can be mitigated by using adequate resources, increasing your manpower and proceeding to
work at the available work-fronts.
We trust you find the aforementioned self-explanatory and clarifies the matter.
This is for your information and further action.

Yours faithfully,
