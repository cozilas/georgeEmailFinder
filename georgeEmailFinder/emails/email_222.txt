Subject : Concern for distribution of photographs and videos
There is concern that photographs and videos of the current storm water impact on the project may
have been taken by persons who have not been authorised in writing to take such photos or videos, and
that these may be posted to social media or shared in any way with entities not directly involved with
the current incident.

Please be reminded that ADAC will take action against any individual or company who posts or in any
way distributes photographs or records of the MTB and MTA Projects and in particular, of the current
storm impact.
Yours faithfully,
