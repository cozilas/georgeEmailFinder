Dear Sir,

Further to our letter reference 1) and Engineer's Instruction No. 78 to delete the diesel generators
reference 2) we reiterate your obligations to fulfill the Employers Requirements,Volume 6, Clause 11.4.3
Landscaping, specifically regarding the urban integration of " .....all functional and structural features
pertaining to stations .... "by minimizing the visual impact of technical Pop Ups on the urban
environment. This includes the supplementary UPS/ battery rooms introduced in reference 2) to
replace the diesel generators. We confirm that the requirement is for one supplementary UPS/ battery
room with minimum
area of 70 m2 and minimum clear headroom of 5 m per I type station and two such rooms for X type
stations.

The following additional guidance is provided:

1.
For stations with switch boxes (Ras Bu Abboud, Bin Mahmoud, Al Sudan, Sport City and
Muaither) the supplementary UPS/ battery room {s) can be located within the overburden above the
switchbox provided that this room is adjacent or as close as possible to the SPS MV/ LV room.

2.
For stations without switchboxes (Qatar National Museum, Al Sadd, Joaan, Al Waab, Al Aziziyah,
Doha Zoo and Al' Rayyan Sbuth) the supplementary UPS/ battery room {s) can be buried within the
available overburden above the station box provided that it does not encroach within Ashghal's RoW
or conflict with utilities. To fac ilitate this burial the minimum clear
headroom of the supplementary UPS/ battery room can be reduced to 3 m with a subsequent increase
in the minimum area to 100 m2

3.
In situations where neither of these options is possible (Souq Waqif) the supplementary UPS/
battery room should be located within the station box utilizing rooms which are currently shown
unallocated in the DD1 Architectural Layouts. To assist with facilitating this, an alternative
configuration of two separate rooms with minimum clear areas of 35 m2 is acceptable.
Yours faithfully,
