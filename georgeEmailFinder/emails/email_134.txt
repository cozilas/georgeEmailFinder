As advised in our e-mail, the above referenced rooms are being occupied by the Employer’s Other
Contractor(s) despite the absence of an approved NOC confirming firstly that all [principle] snags have
been attended to and secondly permitting that such rooms are ready for occupation and use.
We therefore conclude that the noted rooms must have been complete with minimal snags or you
would not/could not have taken possession; and are therefore deemed to be Substantially Complete.
In which case we remind you of the provisions Sub-Clause 18.1.1(a) of the Conditions of Contract which
provides the following definition, in so far as substantial completion is deemed ‘to have been
reached/completed and ready for Taking Over when … the Works required … have been completed in
accordance with the requirements of the Contract subject only to such minor outstanding items of work
and/or rectification of such minor blemishes and/or defects:
(i)
The existence of which individually and collectively will not affect the use of the Works or for the
purpose intended; and
(ii)
The rectification of which can very quickly and conveniently be attended to by the Contractor
post Taking Over without causing any significant inconvenience or nuisance to the Employer or any
relevant Third Party …’ [bold and underlined for emphasis]

In view of this and on the basis the Employer has already taken possession of the above rooms, we
request that you issue the appropriate Taking Over certificates in accordance with Sub-Clause 18.2.1.
Yours faithfully,
