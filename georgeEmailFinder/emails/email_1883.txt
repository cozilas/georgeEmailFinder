Dear Sir,

Further to your letter reference 2) whereby you have presented the current status of the issues related
fo Architectural Branding and our confirmation under letter reference 1) that a) the "five key items for
DD1", b) minor related inclusions, and c) other non AMB related Qatar Rail preferential inclusions are

feasible and can be incorporated into subsequent design development as part of an overall agreement
with no time and cost impact, please find attached for your reference the DD1 Stations drawings that
were duly signed by QR, PMC and Contractor incorporating the above.

As agreed, we will progress and submit for SONO DD2a (30%) designs for all Stations on the basis of
these DD1 drawings.

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.
Yours faithfully,
