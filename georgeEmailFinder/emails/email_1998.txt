Table 1: Summary of preliminary valuation

The Contractor hereby provides a preliminary estimate of the adjustment to the Contract Price in the
net amount of QAR 2,141,603.72 as detailed in Attachments 1) and 2).

The Contractor’s preliminary assessment of the time impact shows that the completion of Entrance 2
will be delayed by 3 to 4 month due to the need for piling at the new entrance location. This will extend
the duration of TTM accordingly.

The Contractor kindly requests the Engineer to clarify the final position of entrance 2 and secure the
necessary land for the entrance and the temporary site installation.

Finally the Contractor understands that the necessity to relocate entrance 2 is a fait accompli and kindly
requests the Engineer to formally issue an Instruction under 13.1.1. Any delay in doing so increases the
risk of additional works to be abortive and further delays to be incurred.

The Contractor reserves its rights to recover any time related costs in connection to this Variation which
shall be addressed under a separate cover.

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.

Yours faithfully,
