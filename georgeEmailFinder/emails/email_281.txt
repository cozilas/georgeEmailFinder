Lighting Calculations for All Luminaires

Dear Sir,
In response to your letter reference 1) and 2) above, we would like to confirm the following:
As previously confirmed in our letter reference 3) above, the introduction of Project Lighting Calculation
via Section 1.4B of Project Specification and Bulletin 110, came after incurred delays related to
substantial lighting design changes and the commencement of the procurement process following
approval of the applicable material submittals. Our letter 3) also stressed that the existing schedule
(Project Programme (Rev 06)) did not provide adequate time to postpone the procurement of fixtures
until such time a a comprehensive lux level calculation was performed to verify the IFC design and the
specification parameters.
In consideration of the above and bearing in mind the late stage of the Project, we maintain our position
and will not be submitting retrospective calculations. We therefore do not accept any lability and/or
responsibility for any failure of the lighting performance arising from any deficiencies in the design,
which is the responsibility of the Employer and its team.
Should you have queries, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Yours faithfully,
