Subject Basement Water Leaks
Construction Management Agency
Dear Sir,
We refer to the evaluation of the current leak condition, rectification methodology and the site
investigation report- " Leakages in carpark, pump room and utility rooms" enclosed in letter (1) and
respond as follows:
Concrete durability requirements were established considering the design life of the building and
hence the building substructure was designed to be water tight. The repeated and widespread
distribution of observed leaks indicates that the waterproofing system has been compromised in
multiple locations thus allowing long term, persistent ingress of groundwater through the basement
structure.
There have also been numerous instances of crystal salt deposits observed on the internal concrete
surfaces which is indicative of high salinity groundwater. The salinity of the water present in the
structure and its effects has not been determined by the Contractor nor considered within the leak
report commissioned.
Ingress of aggressive groundwater and the attack/corrosion of the concrete and reinforcement due to
exposure to corrosive compounds such as sulphate and /or chloride ions may result in significant
degradation of the structure and potential durability issues and service life reductions.
Prolonged water ingress also acts as a transit route for moisture and dampness with in the building
resulting in associated environmental hazards, which can become airborne and spread throughout the
building fabric.
The Contractor has been carrying out resin injection of concrete in the leak affected areas from 2014
to date, however, water ingress, repeat leaks and new leak locations are still occurring. Considering
t hat injection resin repairs have been going on for more than five (5) years without arresting the
leakage the Contractor needs to reassess its repair methodology and explore whether a more effective
/permanent rectification solution should be considered, especially as use of current repair method
during building operations has the potential to be enormously disruptive and incur considerable OPEX
costs to the owner.
The entry of groundwater through the basement slabs and walls will potentially introduce additional
costs to operate and maintain the facility including potential loss of availability and function for the
building owner. The Contractor has not considered how areas of the basement that are covered-up
and concealed will be systematically monitored in future to ensure no leakage is present. The
potential for latent defects within the concrete structure and the long term risks and impact on design
service life resulting from water ingress has not been fu lly addressed by the Contractor.

The Contractor has taken steps to inject cracks to arrest the water ingress, however, water ingress
follows the path of least resistance and so as leaks are repaired this has forced water to find an
alternative path where cracks persist and become pathways through the structural elements, leading
to leaks elsewhere. The Engineer again concurs with Section 7 Part (ii) of the report which
recommends that 'the leaking joints have to be injected not only at locations where they are leaking
but for the entire length, as water has a tendency to leak through the path of least resistance and
once it is sealed, new leakage can happen at adjacent locations' .
The report cites codes and standards for crack widths and analysis for deriving appropriate repair
solutions and advises that for a maximum allowable crack width of greater than or equal to 200 Â·.
microns cracks need to be sealed by injection for exposure class XS2 + XS1 + XS3 . Furthermore, the
report advises that whilst the injection materials used currently are suitable for penetrating cracks up
to 200 microns width, it is suggested to use a resin that has the capability to penetrate cracks up to
100 microns. We request the Contractor to confirm if this recommendation has been implemented.
The Engineer concurs with the reports observations and conclusions and would further advise that the
Contractor has failed to conduct a regular crack monitoring regime to identify and track crack
locations and propagation. The Contractor has acted to the contrary and has covered up and put out
of reach many areas where ground water has since ingressed. Over time th is water penetration has
manifested itself in building void areas, wall and floor finishes, steel imbeds and steelwork supports
and accessories affixed thereto. There is also evidence of excessive corrosion of exposed
reinforcement steel. Whilst the report notes that injection has taken place, it is advised that the
injection ports were fixed too close to the cracks and the cracks were found to be injected
haphazardly.
The Contractor is in a situation whereby it is impossible to rectify defective works without stripping
out all materials and finishes to get back to the structural elements and to map all cracks equal to or
greater than 200 microns and to inject same. This will require all metal elements affixed to the
concrete structure to be removed, stripped back to the base metal and re-galvanized.
Concerning the widespread observations of corroded bolts, nuts and washers, it is evident that
aggressive rusting has taken place which calls into question the quality and suitability of these fixings
and the galvanizing process. The Contractor is requested to engage a metallurgical test agency to
conduct testing on these fixtures and fittings and to confirm compliance with the Contract
specification.
The Contractor should engage a specialist corrosion / concrete / petrographic specialist company to
further test and analyses the existing structure, particularly the effects and potential risk for localized
steel corrosion and concrete attack. Testing and analysis would be expected to include, but not
limited to, non-intrusive field rebar scanning, concrete core sampling and testing, concrete dust
sampling and testing, petrography analysis, half-cell potential tests and groundwater chemical testing
and analysis. The specialist will provide an estimate of the current concrete design life and can
determine the necessity (if any) and options for remedial works.
Lastly, it is evident that the contractor has taken action at site to cover up areas where
dampness/corrosion existed. This is completely unacceptable and must stop. The contractor must act
openly and transparently with the engineer to engage in a systematic process to identify all areas that
require treatment and to undertake all necessary steps to remediate the works to bring the building into
compliance with the contract requirements.
It is critical that the contractor takes immediate action to fully understand this scope and to factor this
into their overall schedule for completion.
For your reference, please find enclosed a selection of leak maps and photos which captures a sample of
leak location and types encountered.
Yours faithfully
