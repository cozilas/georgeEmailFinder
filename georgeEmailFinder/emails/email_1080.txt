Subject: Stone Visit Report (STN-13-0iympia Cream) and Design Intent Control Samples
Dear Sir,
We acknowledge the receipt of the above Engineer's Inspection Report ref. MTC-CMA-TCA-Q401-TML01190 dated on 11 January 2015. However we object the content of the report for DEEMAH STN-13
Olympia Cream part and request for clarification as follows;
}> Stone Flooring Spec 096340 issued on July 2012, refers to a Stone Type (STN-08) as Olympia
Cream with a fabricator named of Campolonghi ltalia Sri.
}> Stone Facing Spec 097500 issued on July 2012, refers to a Stone Type (STN-13) as Olympia Cream
with a fabricator named of Campolonghi ltalia Sri.
We have submitted Olympia Cream (STN-08} stone under material submittal ref.
MS/0401/C/0145 dated on 08 May 2013 and received a Code 1 status for the mentioned stone
from Campolonghi ltalia Sri .
We also provided a stone mock up in accordance to SDS ref. SDS/A/0142 with the approved stone
ordered from Campolonghi ltalia Sri.
We requested an inspection for the stone flooring mock up installed with STN-08 Olympia Cream

at the tent adjacent to the Mock up Building by letter ref. MTB/TCA/AECOM/l/001621 dated 11
March 2014.
We therefore understand that the mat erial "Olympia Cream" either used in Stone Flooring or Stone
Facing with different tags in MTB Project, refers to the same material coming from the same quarry
location which is approved previously by the Engineer with Code 1 MS/0401/C/0145 received on 27 May
2013. With reference to El-109 for FOH Toilet Mock up, as a requirement of Spec 097500, we have
submitted
same materiai"Oiympia Cream" with a different tag STN-13. Based on the STN-08 reference, we have
also
requested a confirmation or further information if any for Sample for Stone (Olympia Cream) under a
letter MTB/TCA/AECOM/l/002003 dated on OS June 2014.
The Engineer's letter ref. MTC/CMA/TCA/0401/TML/00888 and MTB/TCA/AECOM/l/001985,
(KPF/PD/2132/LTR/00297) clearly mentioned that'' ... For STN-13 Olympia Cream, please note that vein
of the submitted sample is less desirable than one presented to us during earlier design review, Per Spec
097500 ... " and also Engineer's letter MTC/CMA/TCA/0401/TML/00922 dated on 25 June 2014 stated
that
" ... Veins and Colours of Stone Shall be Similar to the approved samples ... 11
Based on the comments of the Engineer, please note that by letter reference
MTB/TCA/ AECOM/l/002070, " ... STN-13 Olympia Cream: The aforementioned material is not uniform in
nature, usually the veins are scattered over a big block& are not equally parted. Please find attached
photo (Ref.0001} from Campolonghi ... 11
Please be advised that KPF/ADAC/JV representatives were invited for a stone inspection for STN-13
Olympia Cream at Khaters Factory in Italy to progress with official submissions to the Engineer. On the
date of the inspection 18 November 2014 we note that the KPF Design Team brought along 3 nos. of
new
stone samples 300x300 for "Olympia Cream" with a tag from Campolonghi ltalia Sri. introduced as
control Samples for which the visual appearance is totally different than the previously approved Code 1
Olympia Cream material from the same fabricator.
The inspection was followed up with the exhibition of six slabs which were intended as a true reflection
the nature of this material. KPF/ADAC team marked the acceptable/unacceptable portions of the slabs
and followed with a discussion with the Vendor to confirm with the quarry owner on the feasibility of a
vein free store.
STN-13 Olympia Cream was again submitted under MS/0401/A/0405 on 27 October 2014 and received
Code 3 on 07 December 2014.
The latest STN-13 Olympia Cream submission is made under MS/0401/A/0460 on 29 December 2014
also
including a certificate from a quarry of origin in Tunisia to satisfy the Engineers previous comments, still
pending with the Engineer with the discussions of a vein free stones.
In view of the above, we would like to state our understanding for the expectations for STN-13 Olympia
Cream.
Objections;
)> Firstly, we object to the parts of the report where KPF compares the STN-13 Olympia Cream slabs
in Khater Factory with the new "Olympia Cream" sample introduced on 18 November 2014 at the
factory inspection. We request a revised report from the Engineer which removes the comparison
of slabs visual characteristics with these different samples.
)> Secondly, we object to the report where Olympia Cream vein characteristics are eliminated. This is
the inherit characteristic of the material which should be recognized and accepted by the
Engineer. As previously commented, the designer intended to see similar veins as the approved

sample. Third, we object to the MS/0401/A/0405 received on 07 December 2014 detailed comments
Item 1 for receiving Code 3 " ... The material sample of Olympia Cream does not match the
specified design intent as represented by KPF's Control sample of Olympia Cream {Provided by
Campolonghi). The visual characteristics and aesthetic appearance of the Deemah submittal are
different from Olympia Cream specified by KPF. See Fig. 1 for stone comparison. Contractor to
resubmit to match KPF's Control sample ... " As seen clearly from the previous correspondences,
MS/0401/A/0405; The Engineer cannot give Code 3 for Item 1 due to it is not matching with the
sample firstly seen on 18th November 2014 in Italy.
Conclusion;
}> If the design intent of the Engineer is to proceed with the newly introduced Stone Facing STN-13 ,
this is totally a different material which needs to be re-evaluated.
}> If the design intent of the Engineer is to proceed with the already inspected slabs at Khaters
factory in Italy, it is confirmed by the quarry that the inspected slabs are indicative of this vein
characteristic. We request the Engineer to review Olympia Cream slab inspection comments and
consider their selection criteria by recognizing the nature of this material and allow us to proceed
accordingly.
In light of the above, The Engineer is requested to respond our concerns and clarifying the design intent.
The Engineer has been supportive in this regards for which we thank their efforts. However the formal
communication and record is required to be corrected and we require a clear direction to resolve the
ambiguities.
Yours faithfully,
