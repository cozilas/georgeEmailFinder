Dear Sir,
In the absence of any response to the Contractor's letter (1), the Contractor solicited the opinion of a
third
party expert and for this express purpose commissioned the Building Research Establishment Ltd. (BRE)
to
write a report on the suitability ofthe CP main roof gypsum board rejected by the Engineer.
The aforesaid BRE report is appended herewith for the Engineer's review. Â·
The Contractor trusts the Engineer will concur with the report findings and rescind the current gypsum

board contract rejection.
Yours faithfully
