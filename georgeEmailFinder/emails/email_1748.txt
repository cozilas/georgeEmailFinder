Dear Sir,

Engineer's Assistant refers to letter reference 1), wherein the Contractor was directed to submit a
quotation for any cost and time impact. The Contractor's response was due by 19 October 2016, but to
date the Contractor has not responded.

Further to letter reference 1), the Contractor's delay in providing the quotation is preventing the
Engineer from making an informed decision under the Sub-Clause 13.2.3.

The Co tractor ;s d;rected to prov;de the quotat;on w;thout any further delay.

Yours faithfully,
