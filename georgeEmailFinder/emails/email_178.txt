Engineer’s Unreasonable Snagging Comments regarding Sprinkler Installation at Pier 4
Sector 4.14C– Request for Engineer’s Instruction (EI) and Variation Order (VO) in order to integrate
Variation / Change into Works
Dear Sir,
We refer to your letter ref: (1) following issuance of E-Notice No. 0184 (ref: 2) in which you opine,
amongst other things, that “the void space current [sic] installed sprinklers do not meet the criteria for
the omission of sprinklers as per NFPA-13 Clause 8.6.7.2” and that we are somehow responsible for the
matters subject detailed in our letter ref: (2).
For the reasons comprehensively set out in our letter ref: (2) we disagree; and it is clearly evident from
your reply (1), you have either elected to ignore the content or missed the crux of the issue entirely.
We remind you that the Works associated with the installation of the sprinkler system located at the
area of L3.1 (HOTEL/OFFICES/LOUNGES) Pier 4 Sector 4.14C, have been completed based on the IFC
Drawings prepared by the Employer’s Design Consultant; who, as the design consultant for the Project,
are responsible for the design, not us. We have simply constructed the Works according to their design.
Therefore any requirement for us to install any additional sprinklers to the area or vary what is currently
shown on any IFC Drawings represents a change; and if you require us to proceed with integrating any
changes or revisions to the Works, then you are obligated to issue us an EI / VO in order for us to do so.
Meanwhile, until such time you take the action required of you and issue us an EI / VO in accordance
with the express requirements of SAA8, we are unable to proceed with implementing any changes to
the sprinkler system cited in letter ref: 2 and will maintain what is reflected in the existing IFC design.
Yours faithfully,
