Subject Contractor's Key Personnel and Management Team
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence {1) to {4) wherein the Engineer issued to the Contractor
Notices to Correct regarding the declining resource levels within the Contractor's site based team and
we reiterate our concerns.

We understand that the Contractor has recently demobilized several members of their management
team and some key personnel have submitted their resignation due to alleged financial issues. This
rapid decline in the Contractor's Management team at this critical stage of the Project is of great
concern and is not acceptable given the current delays to the Project and will cause further
detrimental impacts to the progress of the works at site, statutory approvals and closeout process.
This is a breach of the Contractor's obligations under the Contract.
Whilst we understand that the Contractor is in the close out stage of the Project and is streamlining
their management team, it is imperative that you maintain the personnel with the knowledge and
experience that has been acquired over the duration of the Project to bring it to a successful close.
Pursuant to Clause 14.9.2 of the Conditions of Contract, the Contractor is required to ensure that the
key personnel are available and have sufficient capacity to properly fulfill their specific functions for
the duration of the Contract. Furthermore, and as required under Section 01 31 03 of the
Specifications Clause 1. 1.4 A and C the Contractor shall maintain adequate numbers of skilled and
competent workmen and supervisors and adequate numbers of responsible, competent experienced
Consultants and Subcontractors.
To this extent, we have conducted a review of what we understand to be your remaining management
team and arrived at the attached list which identifies the personnel which we considered to
be vital for the completion of the Project. We urge the Contractor to review the attached list and
advise on your course of action.
Yours faithfully,
