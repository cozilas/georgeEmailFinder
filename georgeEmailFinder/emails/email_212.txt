Subject:Recovery of Overheads and Profit for Fit Out Works to Departure & Arrival,
Pavilions, Icon Stores & Arcade Areas
Dear Sir,
We write in response to your letter reference (6) rejecting our claim for damages for breach of contract
for instructing the omission of works for the purposes of giving that work to another Contractor(s). As
we have previously explained, it is considered a breach of contract for the Engineer to omit works to
give to other contractors. (See references 1 to 3).
In view of the above, and with reference to the previous correspondence regarding similar matters as
mentioned above, we reiterate that the matter of fact that the Engineer is in breach of Contract
remains. As described elaborately in the previous correspondence, every single commentary, all legal
sources and every court has come to the conclusion that under the terms of most Contracts, and in this
case our Contract, an Employer who exercises a power to omit work must genuinely require the work
not to be done at all, and cannot exercise such a power with a view to having the work carried out by
someone else.

Furthermore, under UAE law, at the very least, the remedy for such breach is the Contractor's lost
profits and lost overheads . Consequently, there is nothing in regards to this matter from previous
similar cases, that permits the Engineer to violate principles of good-faith and proceed with omitting
works from the Contractor to be carried out by someone else without an appropriate remedy to the
Contractor.
To conclude, we notify you that our position remains the same, that the Engineer is in indeed in breach
of Contract and as per our letter reference (5) we reserve our rights under the Contract in regards to this
breach and we require an applicable compensation accordingly.
This is for your kind information.
Yours faithfully,
