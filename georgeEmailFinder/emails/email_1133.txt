Subject Increase in Rev-0 Shop Drawings Due to the Engineer's Comments on SCR Room's
Dear Sir,
We refer to your correspondence referenced as (1) above in relation to shop drawing 401-BD-T-14-GE0.00-TW-SD-123 Rev.01 and 401-BD-T-14-GE-0.00-TW-SD-123 Rev.01 and note the Engineer's
comments were returned to the Contractor on the 12 November 2017.
The Engineer notes the provided comments resulted from the Contractor's non-compliance since it
only submitted a typical backbone rack view and fiber connection details which is insufficient due to
the SCR's not being typical.
Furthermore, the Engineer notes it has been 80 days since the comments were received by the
Contractor on the 12 November 2017 which should have provided sufficient time to produce and
submit the required shop drawings to date.
Any delays which may incur as a result of the Contractor's inaction shall be solely attributable to the
Contractor.
Yours faithfully
