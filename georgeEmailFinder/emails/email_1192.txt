Subject: Notice of Back Charge- M/S Cloisall's Damage Notification on Pier 3 Level 2, Zone 3
Dear Sir,
We write with regards to the enclosed letter received from M/S Cloisall which is self-explanatory.
Further to our review on the contents of the abovementioned letter, we regret to inform you that we
believe your
site personnel have damaged the installed ceiling works on the above location negligently while carrying
out the
works. Subsequently, we have witnessed and signed off M/S Cloisall's Daywork records for the
reinstatement cost
that we consider you shall be responsible.

Consequently, we request you to provide the comprehensive explanation to enable our assessment of
the same.
Failing such, we shall hold you responsible and back charge all the reinstatement cost and other
associated cost from
your account according to the Conditions of Subcontract Agreement Clause 10.3 (Contractor's Claims)
and Clause
12.12 (Other Contractors and Other Subcontractors) whereby you are liable for the loss and damages
arising out of
your action.
Should you have any queries, please do not hesitate to discuss further.
Yours faithfully,
