Subject: Response to the Engineer's Notification of Delay - Failure of Achieving ADDC
Dear Sir,
Approvals for FOBs for January 2018 Target
With reference to your letter reference: (1) above, regarding the failure of achieving ADDC approvals for
FDBs for January 2018 target, we respond as follows.
The Contractor notes the content and concerns of the Engineer in the above referenced letter. The
Contractor shall investigate and discuss with the relevant Subcontractor the delay to those activities.

Whilst the Contractor is making all sensible efforts and using reasonable endeavors to achieve the target
dates as per the rev 10.4 Programme, the Engineer should appreciate that, as the rev 10.4 Programme is
an accelerated Programme, it may not always, due to unforeseen circumstances, be feasible to achieve
some of the ambitious targets set therein.
The Contractor however assures the Engineer and the Employer that it continues to work in good faith
to meet the accelerated target completion date set for the completion of the Works.
We trust the above clarifies your concerns.
Yours faithfully,
