Subject Recovery of Overheads and Profit for Fit Out Works to Departure & Arrival, Pavilions, Icon Stores
& Arcade Areas
Dear Sir,
We write in response of correspondence (1) and of RFVO (2) in which you claim entitlement for
Preliminaries, Preambles, Overheads and Profit due to the omission of planned fit out works to the
Departure and Arrivals, Pavilions, Icon Stores and Arcade Areas.

In the RFVO, the Contractor claims that as result of Engineer's Instruction No. 561C omitting the
planned scope from the Contract, you are entitled to recover an amount of AED 12,286,628.25 based
on a tendered proposal by Cloisall.
The RFVO provides no clear contractual reference to the claimed entitlement and is consequently
rejected by the Engineer. Further, the omission of works (which in this case were not part of the
original scope of works) does not entitle the Contractor to claim for loss of profit and overheads as set
out in Preamble 12 of Schedule 6 of the /Bills of Quantities.
Furthermore, the Contractor in correspondence (1) has stated that the Employer is allegedly in breach
of Contract. The Contractor shall evidence the alleged damage it has incurred which entitles it to be
compensated. Furthermore, the Contractor is required to assess and determine its Subcontractor's
claim and provide substantiation on the cost it has incurred as a result of this alleged breach of
Contract.
Construction
Yours faithfully,
