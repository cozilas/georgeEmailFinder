Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to the Engineer's instruction transmitted under reference 1 above regarding the
added requirement "that all stations are designed so that the primary means of access to any roomis
achieved without the need to enter from the tunnel, tunnel walkways or beyond the platform end
doors".

The Contractor considers that this instruction constitutes a Variation under Clause 13.

This letter therefore serves as the Contractor's notice under Sub-Clauses 3.3.3, 8.4.2 and 20.1.2 of the
General Conditions of Volume 3 of the Contract that due to said instruction the Contractor considers
itself may be entitled to:
(1)
alia,

an extension to the Time for Completion to all Station and Tunnel Sections pursuant to, inter

Sub-Clauses 8.4.1(a), (b} and (c) of the General Conditions , and
(2)

to additional payment to all Station and Tunnel Sections pursuant to, inter alia, Sub-Clause

13.6.1of the General Conditions.
Such Entitlement is also provided by the Qatar Civil Code (Law No 22 of 2004).

Contractor is currently investigating the impact that said instruction may have on the Station and Tunnel
Sections. Should there be an impact to the same, the Contractor will, in accordance with Sub-Clause
20.1.6 of the General Conditions of Contract, endeavour to provide within 28 days of this claim notice,
its fully detailed claim including full supporting particulars of the basis of the claim for the claimed
extension to the Time for Completion to all Station and Tunnel Sections and additional payment. The
fully detailed claim will also include the Contractor's Time Impact Analysis for the adjustment to the
Time for Completion pursuant to Sub-Clause 8.4.4 of the General Conditions of Contract.
Yours faithfully,
