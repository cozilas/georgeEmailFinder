Dear Sir,

Further to the Contractor's Formal Interim Submission (Revision 0) under cover of reference 5 and the
Contractor's Interim Submission (Revision 1) November 2015 Update under cover of reference 4 of
Claims for Extensions of Time, Payment for Additional I Varied Works and Reimbursement of Loss and I
or Additional Expense, as no Revised Costs or scheduling delay analysis information is available at this
juncture, subsequently nothing further can be disclosed during the December 2015 update.

As the event giving rise to this Claim has a continuing effect, the Contractor is still collating further
particulars, the Contractor shall be submitting further interim Claim submissions related to the event
giving rise to the Optimisation for the Reduction in Passageways' Width at monthly intervals pursuant to
Sub - Clause 20.1.6(b) of the General Conditions of Contract.

Yours faithfully,
