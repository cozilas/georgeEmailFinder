Dear Sir.

This Is notice under Sub-Clause 2.5.1 that the Employer considers himself to be entitled to payment
from the Contractor due to the contractor's failure to adhere to the requirements of Volume 3, Clause
6.6.1 of the General Conditions of Contract and detailed in Volume 5 Clause 3.1O of the Employer's
Requirements relating to the provision of Client Site Offices.

We have to date issued a number of letters querying the date for the supply of the Client Site offices
(referenced above). This issue is also discussed at the weekly Commercial meetings with the intention of
receiving feedback on progress.

The feedback received has been deeply unsatisfactory and has culminated in one of your commercial
team stating that manufacture of modular units has commenced and subsequent verification that this
statement was untrue and that the construction of the modular units had not in fact commenced.

We have also discussed with you storage restrictions, cramped working conditions for PMC I Qatar Rail
staff and have requested that you propose alternative accommodation arrangements untilthe site
offices are ready for occupation. To date we have received very little reassurance that the issue is
receiving your full attention and believe that a realistic timeframe for the completion of offices is into
the New Year. As the offices were due for completion by 30 May 2014 this is deeply unsatisfactory.

The Employers entitlement will have to be agreed I determined with all details forwarded to you. In the
meantime the Employer reserves the right to d t interim payment certificates untilsuch time that this
issue is resolved and the Employers entitlement has been fully recovered.

Should you have any queries on the above please do not hesitate to contact us
Yours faithfully,
