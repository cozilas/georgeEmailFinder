Subject: Warranty Action Points
Dear Sir,
Further to recent discussions between the parties and in response to a number of comments on
related Warranty submissions, we note the following warranty action points.
1. A number of Warranty Providers are unwilling to issue warranty documents with an open
date. We therefore ask for the Employer's agreement to use the agreed Substantial
Completion date of 31 October 2019 in such instances.
2. Where the supplier/manufacturer is unwilling to offer a warranty for the full duration
specified, the subcontractor or Contractor will fulfil any outstanding obligations required
under the specifications. In any such case, official confirmation from the
supplier/manufacturer will be provided to confirm their limitation of their standard
warranty.
3. Given .the rapid evolution and limited production and/or support life of IT systems,
equipment may become obsolete and/or unavailable during the warranty periods. In such a
case, the equivalent model available at that time would be provided. We request the
Employer to confirm its agreement.
We trust that the above is agreeable to the Employer and reaffirm our commitment to fulfil the
warranty obligations under the Contract.
Yours faithfully
