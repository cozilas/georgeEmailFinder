Subject: Rectify billing cycle
Dear sir
In an effort to improve our services to our valued customers, this communication is to be considered as
formal notice to rectify our billing cycle. The billing cycle has been changed to month end starting May
2018. Henceforward, all rental agreements will be extended until month end instead of 30 days and
payments will be collected accordingly. This will not affect your monthly rental amounts in any way,
except that your renewal will be on the 1st of every month and you will be receiving renewal
notification email accordingly
Yours faithfully,
