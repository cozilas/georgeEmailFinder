Subject: Target Programme to Completion Updated Rev 10.4
Dear Sir,
Please find enclosed both an Excel and PDF version of Programme Updated Rev 10.4 with a data date of
151 February
2018. The Updated Rev 10.4 Programme represents the collaborative effort between the Employer,
Engineer,
Contractor and Subcontractors to achieve substantial completion of the Works by 30 June 2019.
At present, Programme Updated Rev 10.4 is not an approved Programme as understood either under
the terms of
the Contract between the Employer and the Contractor or the terms of the Subcontract between the
Contractor and
the Subcontractor. However, the Engineer intends to use Programme Updated Rev 10.4 for monitoring
and control
purposes with respect to the Contractor and Subcontractors until it is approved or superseded by a
revised approved
Programme.
Accordingly, we would request you to provide us with, for monitoring and control purposes, your target
programme
to completion which aligns with Programme Updated Rev 10.4. We would request you to provide this to
us by 31
March 2018.
Please note that this letter is not, of itself, to be considered as: (i) an admission of any entitlement to an
extension of
time and/or entitlement to additional payment; or (ii) requiring the Subcontractor to comply with an
accelerated
schedule; or (iii) constituting a waiver of any of the terms of the Subcontract.
We look forward to your cooperation with this matter and timely receipt of your submission. Should you
have any
queries please do not hesitate, in the first instance, to contact our Planning Manager.
Yours faithfully,
