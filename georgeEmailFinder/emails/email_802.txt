Subject:RE: Notification of Back Charge - Store Yard - Unsecured East Airfield near ATCC
Dear Sir,
The Contractor acknowledges receipt of letter reference (1) wherein the Subcontractor shares its
disagreement with the back-charge notification sent by the Contractor previously in respect of the
security measures deployed on behalf of the Subcontractor at the store yard.
The Contractor notes that the Subcontractor is aware that it shall ‘provide own security for own working
and storage areas’. In this regard, the Subcontractor has been identified as one of the companies
benefiting from the use of the store yard near the ATCC; therefore, the security measures shall be on
account of the companies using the land (including the Subcontractor). The Contractor reiterates that
the Subcontractor has failed to provide the requisite security at the store yard; hence, the Contractor’s
letter reference (2).

The Subcontractor further argues that it cannot trace a Contractor’s written instruction to deploy these
security measures; however, the Contractor confirms that an instruction under Sub-Clause 11.3
[Instruction of the Contractor] of the Conditions of Subcontract is not required if the works (or services)
are already an integral part of the scope of the Subcontract.
Finally, the Contractor confirms that the provisions of Sub-Clause 10.3 [Contractor’s Claims] of the
Conditions of Subcontract have been complied with whilst giving reasonable notice to the Subcontractor
that deductions may be applied for the security measures deployed by the Contractor on behalf of the
Subcontractor at the store yard. Please refer to the Contractor’s letter reference (2).
The Contractor trusts the above is clear and considers this matter closed.
Yours faithfully,
