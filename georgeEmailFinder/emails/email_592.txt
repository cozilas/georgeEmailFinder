Subject:Unauthorized Attendance of Subcontractors Personnel
Dear Sirs,
We have been observing lately that Subcontractor Personnel are loitering in the Contractor's main
office, particularly, near the areas allocated to Commercial Department. In line with recent incidents of
unsolicited “snooping” and meddling behaviour from certain Subcontractors, we are compelled to take
below measures. Kindly note that effective immediately:
•
Only TCA JV staff are allowed beyond the Reception Area,
•
If you wish to see any member of TCA JV staff, particularly someone from commercial
department, please make telephone or e-mail contact beforehand, to make an appointment.
•
Subcontractors Personnel found in the areas allocated to Commercial Department without
having made an arrangement to see a particular TCA JV Commercial Team member will be considered to
act “suspiciously” and will be dealt with accordingly
This is for your information and further follow up, if necessary.
In case you should have any queries concerning the above, please do not hesitate to contact the
undersigned.
Yours faithfully,
