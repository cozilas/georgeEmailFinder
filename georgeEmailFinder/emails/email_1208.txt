Subject: Clarification on ADAC's Tax Registration Number (TRN)Customs Importer Code
Dear Sir,
In view of the VAT implementation from 1st of January 2018, in order to custom clear the shipments
upon
arrival at Abu Dhabi Ports, the consignee's Tax Registration Number (TRN) should be linked to their
customs importer code.
Kindly confirm that ADAC's TRN is linked to their customs importer code to avoid any concerns during
the

customs clearance.
Yours faithfully,
