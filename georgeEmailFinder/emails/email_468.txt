Subject: Proposed Partial Relocation of Welfare Facilities to Assist in Progressing
Dear sir,
We refer to the Interface Meeting held on 26 February 2019 attended by representatives from
TCAJV, the Employer, the Engineer and L& T.
At this meeting we advised that our workforce are spending excessive time every day in walking
from their places of work to the welfare facilities whose location is shown in the attached Sketch

No 1. Unfortunately, as a result of this man-hours that would otherwise be utilized in the
construction, commissioning and completion of the Works are being lost. In light of the urgent
requirement to progress the Works and in our endeavours to mitigate delays, we propose to
implement a partial relocation of the welfare facilities to two new areas identified at locations A
and Bon the attached Sketch No. 2. In doing so we confirm that we will bear full responsibility for
any damage to any structure or pavement etc. as a consequence of this relocation.
We look forward to your early confirmation that you have no objection to our proposal.
Yours faithfully,
