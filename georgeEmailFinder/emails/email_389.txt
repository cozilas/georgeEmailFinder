Engineer’s Response to RFI/0401/17162 – Levels L3.0, L3.1, L3.2 and L3.3 Fire Curtain at Hotel Changes is Scope: Request for Engineer’s Instruction / VO
Dear Sir
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described below
may cause delay and/or disruption to the Works; hence we seek your swift resolution of the same.
The Event(s):
On 26 May 2019, we submitted RFI/0401/17162-00 together with amongst other things a series of six
(6) marked-up sketches appended thereto (enumerated as ‘Sketch-01’ to ‘Sketch-06)’, requesting
further clarification and resolution of various design related issues pertaining to the fire curtain at the
Hotel Levels L3.0, L3.1, L3.2 and L3.3. Specifically, we sought your assistance with:
1.
Confirmation as to the arrangement of the fire curtain detailed on attached sketch 01 and 05.
2.
Confirmation required for the additional fire rated dry wall in order to terminate the fire curtain
as detailed on attached sketch 01 and 05.
3.
Confirmation required as to the level of fire curtain as per attached sketches 03, 04 and 06.
4.
Confirmation as to the ceiling level for Levels L3.1, L3.2 and L3.3 as attached sketch 05 and 06.
5.
Confirm whether the non-fire rated dry wall is to cover the exposed fire curtain framing
We requested a response to RFI/0401/17162 by 2 June 2019. However, you failed to reply until 14
calendar days later on 16 June 2019 and simply referred to ‘KPF Mark Up RFI-17612 for all of the
Contractor queries’. In which respect, attached to your response were a total of seven (7) marked up
sketches – consisting of six (6) CAD sketches that were similar to those issued under our original
RFI/0401/17162, plus one (1) additional marked up CAD sketch. Despite all seven (7) sketches being
unreferenced and unnumbered, they all contained extensive numbers of comments.
It is for this reason that we write to you as not only are some of the comments and statements made on
the sketches attached to the reply misguided and erroneous; but they are unclear and ambiguous and
deemed unreasonable, but they also seek to introduce change to the scope of our Works.
Firstly, four (4) of the ‘KPF Mark Up’ sketches attached to the response to RFI/0401/17162 contain a
statement commenting that “According to Contractor’s design …” This statement is not only grossly
wrong but misguided; we are not the designers for this Project, the Employer’s Design Consultant is.
Consequently we accept no liability or responsibility for the noted inconsistencies in the design – that
remains with the Employer’s Design Consultant – we have simply requested their resolution.
Secondly, the majority of the marked-up [KPF] sketches attached to the response to RFI/0401/17162
contain ambiguities and inconsistences, and moreover, attempt to introduce change to the existing
design and scope (refer to the sample comments and our responses to the same in Table 1 below). .

Item KPF Comment TCA JV Response

1
‘Provide Glass wall lining GLZ-16, according to BP 54 signed sketch .amend the cladding supports
and the walls accordingly.
The signed sketches issued under BP54 does not indicate any glass wall
lining GLZ-16 at Level L3 - the subject of Briefing Pack 54 is Landside and Piers Retail Design update –
there is nothing related to Level L3 Hotel area.
If the Consultant’s intention relates to BP 56 and by mistake they mentioned BP 54, the BP 56 signed
sketch 401-JV-A-BP056-30-5.00-GA-SKFC-001_R01_160919 does not indicates any glass wall lining. In
this case the glass wall lining will be under ADAC scope of work not the JV’s.

‘Exposed court yard drywall is not acceptable. Contractor to extend the stone to the glass wall
lining.’
The TCA JV will follow approved shop drawings without any additional stone cladding.
3
‘Provide Glass wall lining GLZ-16, according to BP 54 signed sketch .amend the cladding supports
and the walls accordingly’
The signed sketches issued under BP54 does not indicate any glass wall
lining GLZ-16 at Level L3 - the subject of Briefing Pack 54 is Landside and Piers Retail Design update –
there is nothing related to Level L3 Hotel area.
If the consultant’s intention is BP 56 and by mistake they mentioned BP 54. The following BP 56 signed
sketches do not indicate any glass wall lining. In this case the glass wall lining will be under ADAC’s scope
not the TCA JV’s,:
•

•
401-JV-A-BP056-33-5.00-GA-SKFC-001_R01_160919
Added to which, it is noted that Signed sketch 401-FE-A-BP056-L31-L33-5.00-GA-SKFC-001_R00 added
smoke fire curtain and removed the glass wall lining

‘Provide 150mm allowance for the future cladding and extend the glass wall lining to that end to
provide a proper interface.’
The signed sketches issued under BP54 does not indicate any glass wall
lining GLZ-16 at Level L3 - the subject of Briefing Pack 54 is Landside and Piers Retail Design update –
there is nothing related to Level L3 Hotel area.
If the consultant’s intention is BP 56 and by mistake they mentioned BP 54. The following BP 56 signed
sketches do not indicate any glass wall lining. In this case the glass wall lining will be under ADAC’s scope

It is clear therefore that the comments annotated on the ‘KPF Mark Up’ sketches attached to the
response to RFI/0401/17162 such as those summarised in Table 1 above, have attempted to vary the
existing IFC design and will require a valid Engineer’s Instruction (EI) and a Variation Order (VO).
SAA8 laid down mandatory procedures to be followed if additional works are required, and you have
failed to follow these; an EI and VO are needed for us to proceed with the aforementioned changes.
We therefore take this opportunity in also reminding you of the provisions of Clauses 2.29 to 2.31 of
Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’) pertaining to Variations, in so far as we are not to
proceed with any Variation unless a Variation Order and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. In
which respect, it is your obligation to issue this Record first if you wish to instigate change; this is only
after the additional time and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.
Meanwhile, until such time as you take the action required of you in accordance with SAA8 Clause 2.29,
we are unable to proceed with implementing the changes noted above and will continue to proceed in
accordance with the existing IFC design to the extent we are able to. We trust this is clear.

Potential Impact:
We note that the foregoing events and/or circumstances are undeniably delaying completion of L3.0,
L3.1, L3.2 and L3.3 of the Hotel, and your / Employer’s Design Consultant’s requirement to introduce
fundamental changes to the fire curtain such as those outlined above, particularly at such a late stage of
the Project, will invariably impact on our ability to obtain the Building Completion certificate (BCC)
This is essential to achieving Milestone MS09B and may impact MS09C (Substantial Completion).

Action Required:
It is for this reason therefore, that we issue this E-Notice requesting your prompt action, guidance,
decision or further instruction as may be applicable to resolve the matters referenced herein in order to
mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works. This includes for example:
1.
Issuing such Instruction as necessary for us to instigate the required changes into the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within ten (10) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
Yours faithfully,
