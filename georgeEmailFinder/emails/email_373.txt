Subject:Scope of Contractor’s Rectifications Works to Sewer Pipelines
Dear Sir,
We write in response to your letter ref: (1).
We note your comments in relation to the water testing and while on the one hand we are pleased to
be informed that you are prepared to ‘accept’ the information provided by us in support of the same, on
the other hand we are appreciably perturbed to be informed that your acceptance is conditional upon
us ‘committing to providing long term maintenance provisions of the sewer network.’
This is an audacious suggestion to make and one that we cannot entertain nor will we accept; not only
does it allude to an open ended commitment but we remind you that the problems associated with the
subsidence occurring on this Project (which we hasten to add is not just limited to sewer pipelines but is
affecting the sub-building infrastructure and MTA Works as well), appears to have been caused (as
advised by Robert Bird Group) by: (i) the inappropriate and not fit for purpose Contract Specification for
backfill material which allows for a high percentage of fines (up to 50%) and which does not exclude the
presence of gypsum; (ii) the actual backfill material used (from Stockpile No 2 which complies with the
Specification and which you approved); and (iii) the presence of cavities in the substrata. In other
words, the problems associated with the subsidence occurring on this Project do not arise as a result of
any matter for which we are responsible. You are only too aware of our contentions on this, which have
been outlined in many missives issued by us to date including inter alia our letter ref:
MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/014380, dated 8 June 2019, so why then should we accept your misguided
suggestion for accepting responsibility for long term maintenance?
In which respect, we further remind you that in your letter dated 8 May 2019 (ref: MTC-CMA-TCA-0401LTR-10673) you instructed us to re-line the full extent of the MTB network pipelines and named the
supplier, yet there is no mention of special terms for maintenance.
We are willing to engage in meaningful discussions with you on finding a way forwards for addressing
the rectification works, but suggestions such as that outlined your letter will not be entertained.
Yours faithfully,
