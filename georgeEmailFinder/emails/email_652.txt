Subject:
Request for Engineer’s Instruction [RFEI/0401/0730]
Coordination for SOC Fit-out – Floor Boxes
Dear Sir,
The Contractor refers to your letter referenced (1) above, regarding the MTB Security Operations Centre
(SOC), wherein the Engineer enclosed a furniture overlay onto the current raised access floor and floor

box arrangements. With the mentioned letter the Engineer requested the Contractor to use the
drawings enclosed therein to coordinate the final location of stub-ups (for control room consoles) and
floor boxes (for desks), within the offices.
The Contractor hereby informs the Engineer that the above issue was never concluded before the
Effective Date of 4th September 2018 and remains a contentious issue which is not subject to SubClause 1.7.2 and 1.7.4 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment Number 8.
Consequently, the response received after the Effective date of 4th September 2018 constitutes a
Variation to the Contract and the Engineer is hereby requested to issue an Engineer’s Instruction for the
works mentioned in your letter referenced (1) and discussed herein, pursuant to CC-20.1.1(b) to enable
the Contractor to proceed with the additional works.
Yours faithfully,
