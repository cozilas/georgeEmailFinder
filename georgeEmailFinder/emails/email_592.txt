Dear Sir,
The Contractor writes with reference to the delays incurred for the provision of drawings showing the
room layout for the relocation of the EMIS from the AMC to the Facility Management Control Room in
Pier 3 as per the EI 759 referenced (2) above.
We hereby notify you pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8
that this event may cause delay to the Works and therefore we seek your swift resolution to avoid any
future disruption or delay pertaining to this matter.
Specifically, with our letter referenced (1) above, we have requested confirmation regarding issues with
the layout and also requested to be given an access date for installation works. Subsequently, with EI
759 you have relocated the EMIS from the AMC to the Facility Management Control Room in Pier 3 and
confirmed that the Elevator Master Intercom shall remain in the AMC room. However, to date, there is
no feedback from the Engineer regarding the aforementioned. Therefore, we kindly request you to
provide the following:

•
Please provide a room layout for the EMIS servers which are shifted from the AMC to the Facility
Management Control Room in Pier 3;
•
Please provide access date for the installation of Master Intercom Station in the AMC room.
Your further guidance, decision and/or instruction is required at the earliest; failing which the Works are
likely to be delayed and/or disrupted.
We reserve our rights under the Contract pursuant to Sub-Clause 27.1 (Contractor’s Claims) to an
extension to the Time for Completion and additional Costs arising from the above described event.
Yours faithfully,
