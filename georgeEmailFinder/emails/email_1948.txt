Dear Sir,

Further to the Contractor's Notice of Claim (reference 1), the Contractor respectfully requests the EA's
delegated approval, pursuant to GC 20.1.6, for Claim Nr 62's formal submission date to be extended by
42 days from 07 July 2016 to 25 August 2016. However, due to the subject matter of the Claim which
involves an in depth study/analysis of (1) the designs resulting from the optim ization measures finally
adopted and of
(2) the time implications (if any) of such resulting designs upon the Time(s) for Completion, the
Contractor further proposes that this 42 day extension period is to be automatically extended from 25
August 2016 by further 42 day periods on a rolling basis until either Party unilaterally gives 28 days'
notice to the other Party that the 'rolling basis' extension is to end.
Yours faithfully,
