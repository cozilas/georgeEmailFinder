Dear Sir,
Further to our email reminder referenced in (3) above, we write to record your continuous failure to
submit a Shop Drawing Schedule and Log. Please be informed that we are concerned with your
continuous failure to submit the aforesaid required documentation by 7th July 2018. Moreover, you are
reminded that you initially committed to submit all shop drawings in January 2018. Therefore your
request to submit all shop drawings by September 2018 is hereby rejected.
In view of the above failure, we hereby issue you this [Notice to Correct] in accordance with Subcontract
Clause 22.1 which states:
“If the Subcontractor fails to carry out any obligation under the Subcontract, the Contractor may by
notice require the Subcontractor to make good the failure and to remedy it within a specified
reasonable period.”
Therefore, you are hereby reminded to submit a Shop Drawing Schedule and Log including all shop
drawings within seven (7) days from receipt of this letter in order to avoid further delay to the project.
It is noted that any delays, costs, losses and/or expenses incurred by us and/or Other Subcontractor/s
arising as a result of the above delays shall be at your risk and recovered from your account in
accordance with the Subcontract clauses 10.3, 16.6.1 and other relevant clauses.
This is for your immediate action and attention.
Yours faithfully,
