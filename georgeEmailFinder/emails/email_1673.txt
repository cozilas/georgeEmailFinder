Dear Sirs,

Further to the Contractor's formal Notice issued under cover of reference 5 in accordance with General
Conditions ("GC") 8.4.2 and 20.1.2 concerning the Engineer's Instruction Nr 82 (issued pursuant to GC
13.1.1) to change the requirement for autowalks ("the Event"), the Contractor hereby encloses its
formal interim submission (Revision 0) for Claim Nr 040 in accordance with GC 8.4.4 and GC 20.1.6. The
submission date for Claim 040 had been agreed to be extended to 26 January 2016 by the Engineer's
Assistant in accordance with GC 20.1.6 via reference 3.

As the Event has a continuing effect, the attached submission is to be considered as interim in
accordance with GC 20.1.6{a). The Contractor shall therefore be submitting further interim submissions
with respect to the Event at monthly intervals as required by GC 20 .1.6(b).

Yours faithfully,
