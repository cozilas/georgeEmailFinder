Dear Sir,

We refer to your presentation on Wed 25 March 2015 in relation to EE Shaft ELS. It is of grave concern
to us that the presentation did not reflect any MEP consideration related to your contracted scope of
works . In particular, we refer to a lack of space proofing provisions to meet the Employers

Requirements and no provision for the infrastructure related to duct routes for the MEP needs and TPS
cabling from the at grade structure to the tunnel invert.

We request that ALYSJ JV update their presentation to take accord of your contractual obligations and
represent to us in the very near future
Yours faithfully,
