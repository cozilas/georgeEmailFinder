Subject:Post SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0207
Delays to Commissioning Inspections by CxA
Dear Sirs,
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
The matters described in Annex A concern unreasonable delays on the part of CxA (the Employer’s
Commissioning Consultant), to undertake Commissioning Inspections to 7 Final Distribution Panels (FDB)
to Levels L0.0, L3.0 and L3.2 on 5 January 2020, despite us requesting that they do so.
Potential Impact
Delays and disruption due to the events and circumstances outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
impacting on completion of testing and commissioning. This will invariably impact on our ability to
achieve Milestone MS09B and prevent us from achieving Substantial Completion (Milestone MS09C).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delays and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned immediately upon receipt of this e-notice.
Nevertheless, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
We write to notify you of concerns we have in relation to the Employer’s Commissioning Consultant
(CxA) failure in undertaking Commissioning Inspections to 7 Final Distribution Panels (FDB) to Levels
L0.0, L3.0 and L3.2 on 5 January 2020 despite us issuing a Commissioning Inspections Request (CIR).
By way of our e-mail dated 4 January 2020 [05:49 PM] we provided ADAC with a CIR schedule listing out
various FDBs to various levels offering them for inspection by CxA on 5 January 2020. This was then
followed by a further CIR schedule issued vide our e-mail dated 6 January 2020 [05:49 PM] listing out a
further series of FDBs for inspection by CxA as part of “today’s inspection”.
However, in its response dated 6 January 2020 issued at 08:00 AM, ADAC advised us of the following:
‘During yesterday’s meeting on site [inspection arranged for 5 January 2020] CxA said they would
witness FDBs from other substations if they had the SMDB and LV mains CIR approved – just checking
the first one of the list from the schedule you sent and LV Mains is not even ATP4. I then went on to
check others and again the upstream equipment is not signed off and so CxA will not witness these
panels today.’
Our position is as follows:
We scheduled 12 panels for the CIR inspection on 5 January 2020 (refer to Table 1 below).
Table 1

Out of these, CxA failed to inspect 7 FDBs. Details pertaining to all seven FDBs, room number and level
etc., not inspected by CxA on 5 January 2020, are set out and summarised in Table 2 below:

We consider the reason of non-attendance by CxA on 5 January 2020 recorded in ADAC’s e-mail dated 6
January 2020 does not apply to the panels listed in Table 2 above. In our view, we maintain:
1.
All 7 panel are ATP 3-4 approved;
2.
No high impedance value for those panels; and
3.
Upstream (LV mains and SMDB) is not approved but this should not prevent CxA from attending.
Accordingly, CxA’s failure in undertaking Commissioning Inspections to the seven (7) FDBs to Levels L0.0,
L3.0 and L3.2 on 5 January 2020 identified in Table 2, will invariably delay us and as such delay
completion of our testing and commissioning. This will invariably knock on and impact our ability to
achieve Milestone MS09B and prevent us from achieving Substantial Completion (Milestone MS09C).
Yours faithfully,
