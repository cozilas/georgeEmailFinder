Subject: Pipework and other infrastructure subsidence: delayed Instructions and failed
sub-building ducts
Dear Sirs,
We refer once again to your failure to produce a complete, fully designed and detailed and properly
instructed and Issued For Construction set of documentation in respect of the remedial works to the
subsided and subsiding perimeter and sub-building infrastructure on this project.
Having informed you of the recent discovery that ducts containing major live electrical services
installed under the main airport building have collapsed, it seems the magnitude and scope of this
issue continues to increase. We are investigating the extent ofthe damage to these services and will
report as soon as we have sufficient information but at the very least it is probable we will not be
able to use these ducts as required to complete this project.
We suspect that you too have concluded that, even if you are able to issue Instructions immediately,
it is unlikely it would be possible to procure mobilise commence and complete remedial works in
time to allow the full functioning of the Airport by the required date. We continue to await your
decisive and appropriate action in this matter.
Yours faithfully
