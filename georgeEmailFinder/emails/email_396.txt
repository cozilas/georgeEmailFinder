Subject SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No.0089 Overdue Responses to 728 Shop Drawings
as at 2 May 2019 and SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No.0095 Overdue Responses
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence (1) and (2) regarding the potential delay to the Works as a
result of alleged delays to the response of Shop Drawings.
The Contractor is reminded that in order to avoid any potential delays, they are required to submit the
drawings in a timely manner as per Clause 3.3. f of Section 01 33 00 of the Specifications otherwise
there is no entitlement for any extension to the time for completion. We note that the majority of the
submitted drawings are revision 2 and above which evidences the poor quality of these submissions
and the inability of the Contractor to effectively address the Engineer's comments.
The Contractor's assertion that the alleged delay to the review of the Shop Drawings will potentially
have an impact to their ability to achieve Substantial Completion is unfounded and the Contractor is
referred to its critical delays to the Project that have been notified to the Contractor by the Engineer.
The Engineer reserves the Employer's rights pursuant to Clause 10.3 of the Conditions of Contract for
any delays which may be incurred to the Project.
Yours faithfully,
