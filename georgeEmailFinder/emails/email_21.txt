Dear ADMC Dubai Employees,
It has come in our attention that in ADMC projects are repeatedly happening several technical mistakes
due to
poor workmanship and poor supervision. Consequently, all of these are causing to our company more
money
and more time and moreover are delaying our site progress and affecting the expectation of our clients.
Hence, we want to highlight and to make aware all ADMC site employee that everybody is responsible
for his
work performance and the quality of the works that he performs during the working hours on site.
This memo's goal is to ensure that all site engineers, foremen, site supervisors, team leaders and all
technicians
should work in compliance with the proper work procedures indicated in project method statements;
they
should use proper tools to perform any work as per project requirement s; they should always work in
accordance with the safety rules; they should do proper reporting of all the work issues to the
supervisor/manager and they should dedicate their best skills for the implementation of the work!
Otherwise, in cases the ADMC employees are not following the proper work procedures and neglecting
their
job responsibilities, the management want to inform that penalties will start to be applied.
The amount of the penalty will be determined by detailed evaluation by the project management, but
non
limited as fol lowing:
-l't time: warning letter
-2nd time: 200 AED penalty+ 2nd warning letter
-3 rd time: termination from the company.
The above policy stands for each ADMC International employee, including site engineers, foreman, site
supervisor and site superintendents, technicians of all trades and is already being implemented.
This is for ADMC's Employees information and strict compliance.
Yours faithfully,
