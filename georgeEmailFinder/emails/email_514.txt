Re-Lack of MEP Clearances, Snagging /De-snagging and Other Assorted Issues for WIR’s

Dear Sir,
We have received your letters (1 to 4) above regarding MEP Clearances, snaggings/de-snaggings and
other issues for WIR`s. We reiterate the points raised in our enclosed emails, that your statements
regarding this matter are incorrect and include false content.
After reviewing the content of your letters, please see our response below regarding this matter,
providing some examples of your false statements:
The WIR comments in your letter allegedly state that there are actions to be taken by us prior to you
proceeding with the WIR works. You have also stated in some cases that we are hindering your works
and we have not provided access etc. We refute these statements and inform you that most of these
works are coded as RS06C which means that the works are completed and are at the final stage as per
the latest ITP . In fact, for many of the works there is no open WIRs, which are as follows:
•
WIR-FIN-18790, WIR-FIN-19445, WIR-FIN-19446, WIR-FIN-19937, WIR-FIN-24944, WIR-FIN24942, WIR-FIN-24940, WIR-FIN-24939 etc have no open WIRs.
•
WIR-FIN-13149 - your statement that the “Work is still no access to verify rectification of Rev01.
Contractor requested to keep on hold the WIR for a few days” is, in fact, incorrect and shows that you
are not complying with your Subcontract obligations. The final inspection for ceiling is actually done
from the floor without a manlift, hence, access is already provided. As you are well aware, we have
never used a manlift for inspection of ceilings. You are therefore required to revise the WIR accordingly.
•
WIR-FIN-13196 - your statement that the “Work is still no access to verify the rectification of
Rev.00 comments. Contractor to provide sufficient access” is also incorrect for the reasons explained in
WIR-FIN-13149 above. You are required to revise the WIR.
Please note that we have stopped reviewing the content of your letters (1 to 4) above, after we
identified numerous incorrect statements and therefore request you to refrain from such actions. We

hereby remind you that your current approach of sending incorrect and unsubstantiated letters will hold
no ground and will only drag the issues longer with consequent delays.
This is for your information and necessary action.
Yours faithfully,
