Subject:Clause 27.1.1: Notice of Claim â€“ Delay Notice No. 0033 [Post SAA8]
Code 3 Small Power Shop Drawings SDS/0401/E/0253-16 - Update
Dear Sir
This letter serves as an update to E-Notice No. 0033 issued by way of our e-mail ref: (1).
By way of reminder: On 21 October 2018, we submitted Shop Drawing Submittal SDS/0401/E/0253 Rev.
16 requesting your review and approval of four Electrical Small Power Shop Drawings appended thereto.
However, not only did you fail to respond to this submittal until 1 November 2018 which is seven
calendar days later than the review period expressly stated in the Contract (refer to Article 1.3 of
Specification Section 013300), but all 4 Shop Drawings were unreasonably granted Status Code 3 with no
clear reason for doing so. This is despite them incorporating the E-Gate designs instructed by
ADAC/CMA via EI-739, concluded during workshops dated 4 and 12 2018, and formalised via the
response to RFI/0401/15949; hence the issuance of our E-Notice issued under e-mail ref: (1).
Our E-Notice No. 0033 also served to insist that given the invalidity of the Status Code 3 response, you
re-code the Shop Drawings no later than 15 November 2018. However, you failed to do so.
You did however eventually acknowledge your original Status Code 3 was unreasonable when on 16
December 2018 you re-coded all four Electrical Small Power Shop Drawings and returned them to us;
which is 56 calendar days later than the response due date specified in the Contract (Table 1 refers).

It is clear that the late and unreasonable Status Code 3 response to the above noted Shop Drawings /
Submittal constitutes an act of prevention and/or breach of Contract and accordingly, we give you
notice pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 of our right to claim:
(i)
An extension to the Time for Completion pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c); and
(ii)
An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.1 pursuant to Clause 9.10, or,
in the alternative, damages for breach of contract.

Interim and/or final details of the time impacts and adjustments to the Contract Price relating to this
event will be provided in due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.5(a), (b) and (c).
Yours faithfully,
