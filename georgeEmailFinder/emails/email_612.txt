Re: Day Work Due to Ref: Cl/00344 Damage Notification

Dear Sir,
We are in receipt of your letter referenced (2) above in which you have submitted a daywork sheet
requesting for an additional payment for the works performed to allow the installation of metal panel
ceiling to facilitate the installation of MEP 3rd fix progression.
Please note that your mentioned letter is refuted and your attention is drawn to our letter referenced
(1) above, where we have provided a detailed explanation about the delays caused by you due to
incomplete ceiling works, which as per your Subcontract obligations you were instructed to mitigate.
We trust the above is clear and consider this matter closed.
Yours faithfully,
