Subject Contractor laydown Areas
Dear Sir,
This is to advise that upon reviewing and verifying both the usage and internal arrangements of the
areas currently allocated to the Contractor as material laydown areas across the site, it is evident that
many of these areas are utilized to store scrap/unusable materials and there are areas that are not
being optimized.
The Contractor is therefore requested to immediately conduct a survey of these laydown areas and
assess its effective utilization with the aim of improving and optimizing its current utilization. Any
scrap or non-usable materials are to be removed off site.
We await to receive the Contractor's plan in this respect within a week upon receipt of this letter.
Yours faithfully,
