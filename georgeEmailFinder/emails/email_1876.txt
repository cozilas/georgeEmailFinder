Dear Sir,

Reference is made to the Engineer’s letters items 2) & 3) regarding the request to submit a cost estimate
under sub-clause 13.2.1.

Further to discussions as to the exact requirement a meeting was arranged to clarify the situation. At
the meeting it was stated that what Qatar Rail required was a cost neutral design proposal. This was
provided in the Contractor’s letter item 1).

The Contractor trusts that this clarifies the current situation.

Yours faithfully,
