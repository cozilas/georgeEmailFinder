Subject: Chairman's Meeting 22 May 2019- Completion Date
Dear Sirs,
We refer to the confirmation made by our representatives at the above meeting that our Works will
be complete by 31 October 2019.
As was expressed by our Project Director in his presentation to the meeting, we are on target to meet
the Completion Date but have drawn to your attention the significant risk that the external
subsidence issue is having on the Works. In addition to the subsided manholes, pipework and
associated hardscaping, we have recently informed you of the collapsed mains services ducts
underneath the Gatehouses, Piers and CP buildings.
Affirmations of the Completion Date are made in the context of all notified prevention matters
including the need for complete, fully detailed and properly Instructed Issued For Construction
documentation providing a permanent solution to the subsided Works in time for the remediation
to be carried out. Whilst accepting that the substructure ducts issue has only recently been
discovered, we have repeatedly recorded our concern at the delay in issuing such documentation
and would urgently request your attention upon the resolution of these matters.
Yours faithfully
