Subject:Deduct Contra Charges from the Original Sub Contract Price
Dear Sir,
We are in receipt of your letter referenced (1) above, wherein you have commented on the Payment
Certificate No. 23 and requested us to correct the contra charges and deduct them from the net amount
and not from the original subcontract amount.
Please note that the changes you are discussing in your letter are not changes done manually but it is as
per the format of the Payment Certificate (PC), which is used for all of our Subcontractorsâ€™ Payment
Certificates.
As discussed several times with your Quantity Surveyor (Mr. Tony Poorten), we reiterate our clarification
that our PC format (Accounting format), cannot be altered specifically to accommodate your request.
We trust that this is a simple accounting issue and can be resolved internally from your side.
In view of the above, we are of the opinion that as of the date of this letter you have a clear
understanding on this matter and we hereby consider it closed.
This is for your information.

Yours faithfully,
