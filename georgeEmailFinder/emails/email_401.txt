Subject:Completion of Milestones MS06A and MS06B
Dear Sir,
We refer to your letters reference at (1) to (8) and (10) above, in which you inform us of alleged slow
progress and a purported failure to achieve Milestones MS06A and MS06B. We also refer to letters ref:
(9) and (11), which although centres upon inaccurate room completion reporting, nevertheless includes
references to the various areas or levels of the Works where you also alleged we are in delay; with many
of those same areas or rooms also being subject to Milestones MS06A and MS06B.
For the reasons set out herein we refute that we are in any way culpable for such delay.
Firstly, with reference to slide 11 of the presentation entitled Chairman Meeting & Walk – 22 May 19
[copy attached], it is our contention that Milestone MS06B is complete, other than special ceiling GL-08
which we have deliberately left unfixed, in order to protect from marking and damage by Others. In
which respect, we can confirm that the materials required for the special ceiling and related works have
been procured and delivered and are carefully protected and stored at site. While in relation to the
achievement of Milestone MS6B, it is our further contention that only snagging work remains for the
400 rooms that are available to ADAC. The remaining 109 rooms are all but complete, but in any event
our on-going activities are not impacting ADAC as there are more than sufficient work fronts available.
Moreover, we further note that the Employer’s fit-out works have commenced and remain on-going in
the rooms that have been handed-over; but at the risk of being repetitive, any snagging works cannot be
successfully undertaken and completed by us until after testing and commissioning
On this issue of snagging, there appears to be a fundamental difference of opinion between us with
regards to when a room is deemed to be complete. It remains a fact there are hundreds of rooms that
have been competed by us, albeit subject to the closing out of minor snagging items. However, you are

of the belief that until such time as all the snags are 100% complete and signed off, the room is being
classified by you as incomplete. On the basis the rooms are complete [bar minor snagging] and have
been made available to ADAC, allowing for unfettered access for the fitting-out works to be undertaken
by Others, not only is your current stance on what is deemed ‘complete’ inflexible but your current
progress reports does not reflect actual physical progress being achieved by us on site.
Given the fact that the rooms are substantially complete, we direct you to Sub-Clause 18.1.1(a) of the
Conditions of Contract which provides the following definition, in so far as substantial completion is
deemed ‘to have been reached/completed and ready for Taking Over when … the Works required …
have been completed in accordance with the requirements of the Contract subject only to such minor
outstanding items of work and/or rectification of such minor blemishes and/or defects:
(i)
The existence of which individually and collectively will not affect the use of the Works or for the
purpose intended; and
(ii)
The rectification of which can very quickly and conveniently be attended to by the Contractor
post Taking Over without causing any significant inconvenience or nuisance to the Employer or any
relevant Third Party …’
In view of this, and on the basis the Employer has already taken possession of many of the rooms for the
purpose of being-fitted out by the Employer’s Other Contractors, we request that you issue the
appropriate Taking Over certificates in accordance with Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 18.2.1.
Secondly, we take this opportunity in reminding you that our ability to achieve Milestones MS06A and
MS06B has been, is being, or is likely to be affected by a succession of differing factors or events.
These include without limitation the following:
1.
The matters referenced in slide 11 of the presentation entitled Chairman Meeting & Walk – 22
May 19 [copy attached] particularly, reference is made to door changes (see item 2 below);
2.
Discrepancies between door schedules concerning doors, door hardware, SACS, power and data
(refer to our letter dated 23 January 2019 ref: MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/013964); and our letter dated 11
February 2019 ref: MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/014018; and
3.
EI 760 Slab Penetrations; the work associated with EI 760 that have been undertaken to date
and the works that will invariably be instructed on this will impact completion of MS06A and MS06B
(kindly refer to slide 10 of the presentation referenced in item 1, copy attached).
4.
Overdue responses to Material Submittals. Refer to the following:
a.
Letter dated 18 February 2019 (ref: MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/014034);

b.
Letter dated 15 January 2019 (ref: MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/013939);

8.
Delays in being provided with Re-Entry Permits / NOCs and the activities of other contractors
affecting finalisation of MEP works and C&E integration to various Duty Free and F&B Outlets to Level
L2.0 (refer to our letter dated 20 May 2019, ref: MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/014336).
In addition to the foregoing, there are various other factors or events that have affected our ability to
achieve Milestones MS06A and MS06B. These were previously advised by way of the following:
1.
Letter ref: MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/013628, dated 1 October 2018;
2.
Letter ref: MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/013622, dated 21 October 2018
3.
Letter ref: MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/013761, dated 4 November 2018
4.
Letter ref: MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/013792, dated 11 November 2018
5.
Letter ref: MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/013921, dated 9 January 2019
6.
Letter ref: MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/014064, dated 27 February 2019
7.
Letter ref: MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/014245, dated 18 April 2019
It is therefore evidently clear that there are [and in some instances there remains] a successive series of
events and circumstances that have undeniably affected our ability to achieve Milestones MS06A and
MS06B for which we are not culpable; and for which we reserve our rights under the provisions of
Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 15.5.2 and 27.1.1 to additional time and additional cost.
That said however, we reiterate that we are fully committed to ADAC, the Project and to completing our
obligations within the shortest possible time, without compromising on safety and quality.
In addition to the weekly Chairman Meeting & Walk which provides first hand evidence that we are
putting our full effort into completing our remaining scope, we are conducting daily onsite meetings and
coordination discussions with your team members related to the progress of MS06A and MS06B.
Additionally, we continue to submit to you our weekly progress reports, which detail the progress made
week on week against the remaining works associated with MS06A and MS06B also.
We assure you that we are progressively handing over completed rooms, offices and retail areas in a
coordinated manner to best suit ADAC and to facilitate and mitigate delays to the follow-on fitout
works. Priority is being given to rooms identified by you. This practice is ensuring that neither ADAC nor
the end user tenants are suffering undue delay and financial loss. We trust this is clear.
Yours faithfully,
