Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to the Engineer’s Instruction (“EI”) at reference 1 (received by the Contractor on 1
May 2017), which has been issued pursuant to General Condition (“GC”) 3.3.1 of Volume 3 of the
Contract.

The Contractor is of the opinion that this EI is instructing a Variation and may provide the Contractor
with entitlement for additional payment for the resulting varied Works as an addition to the Contract
Price pursuant to GC 13.6.1 and may provide the Contractor with entitlement to receive extension(s) to
the affected Time(s) for Completion pursuant to GC 8.4.1(a) for any delays consequently incurred due to
executing the varied Works.

Accordingly, the Contractor hereby notifies the Engineer and the Engineer’s Assistant of the Contractor’s
intention to claim for its possible entitlement (1) for additional payment due to the aforementioned
Variation Instruction (notification pursuant to GC 3.3.3 and GC 20.1.2) and, (2) for any extensions to the
affected Time(s) for Completion for any delays that may be incurred due to the said EI (notification
pursuant to GC 3.3.3, GC 8.4.2 and GC 20.1.2).

The Contractor respectfully requests the EA’s delegated approval, pursuant to GC 20.1.6, for Claim Nr
94’s formal submission date to be extended from 8 June 2017 by 42 day periods on a rolling basis until
either Party unilaterally gives 28 days’ notice to the other Party that the ‘rolling basis’ extension is to
end.

Yours faithfully,
