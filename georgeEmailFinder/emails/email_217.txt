Subject Post SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0171- Engineer's Response to
RFI/0401/17400- Introduction of Gypsum Ceiling at CP Hotel L2.0 to Underside of
Elevator 0595- Request for Engineer's Instruction (RFEI) & Variation Order (VO)
Cross Ref. (1) MTB/TCA/ AECOM/L/015016 dated 12 November 2019
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence (1), regarding E-Notice No.0171 and we refute the
contents of the letter in their entirety.
The RFI response did not provide a change in the design or Scope of Works but merely provided the
clarification requested by the Contractor. The Contractor was referred to Shop Drawing 401-DM-A02-21-5.17B-CL-SD-015-01 and to the comments provided on 23 November 2015. The Contractor was
to provide the gypsum ceiling in Room 0070 at L3.0 to close the gap and exposed steel structure
complying with Division 01 of the Specification's requirements. The Contractor's statements that "the
drawing relates to stone works and is irrelevant to the ceiling work, the comments to the noted Shop
Drawings are incorrect" etc. are unfounded.
The Contractor should have addressed the provided comments on the Shop Drawings and should have
raised the RFI at that time and prior to execution of the works on site. The refe rred RFI was only raised
on 25 August 2019 whereas the Contractor was aware of the comments on the Shop Drawing since
2015. The RFI response has addressed the query and provided the Contractor with the directions to
proceed.
Regarding the modifications required to incorporate the referred ceiling, the Contractor is referred to
Specification Section 01 31 13, and the requirement for the Contractor to coordinate and submit to
the Engineer any discrepancies through the RFI process and not to withhold any information regarding
known discrepancies. The Contractor has failed to coordinate the interface details and proceeded with

the site installation.
We therefo re do not agree with the Contractor's assertion that the RFI response constitutes a
Variation and remind the Contractor of their obligations to coordinate the works and submit
coordinated documents for the Engineer's approval.
Yours faithfully
