Subject: Request for Engineer’s Instruction [RFEI/0401/16346]
Discrepancy between Door schedule and SACS schedule
Dear Sir,
The Contractor refers to the Request for Information referenced in (1), which has been sent to you on
30th July 2018 in an attempt to clear all the remaining discrepancies between the security access control

systems (SACS) current IFC and doors current IFC. Please note that the discrepancies found, are affecting
many areas of the Project. Please also note that the discrepancies have an impact on the SACS (including
data and power) and the doors & door hardware.
This was never concluded before the Effective Date of 4th September 2018 and remains a contentious
issue which is not subject to Sub-Clause 1.7.2 and 1.7.4 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment
Number 8.
Consequently, the response received after the Effective date of 4th September 2018 constitutes a
Variation to the Contract and the Engineer is hereby requested to issue an IFC door schedule for the
changes, together with an Engineer’s Instruction (for SACS, Electrical, Gov-SCN and doors) pursuant to
CC-20.1.1(b) to enable the Contractor to proceed with the additional works.
Yours faithfully,
