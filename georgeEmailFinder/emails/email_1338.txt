Subject: Interface with Cloisall's Ceiling Package
Dear Sir,
We write to advise you that we have had to issue an instruction to Cloisall to proceed with their scope of
works since AI Ghurair is persistently failing to progress with their works at sufficient pace to maintain
the
program.
Please kindly note that Cloisall's ceiling works are dependent on your back-painted and balustrade glass
being installed prior to the ceiling works commencing as the ceiling ties in with the lower level of the
aforementioned glass.
As a result of your continuous delays in engineering, procurement and production, we are now in a
situation where Cloisall's works are delayed as well as the knock-on effect on the critical commissioning
activities. This has adversely affected both the MTB project and commissioning interfaces that we have
with other direct Contractors.
Cloisall are therefore required to modify their work, to facilitate commissioning, and make repeat visits
to
areas that they are unable to complete due to the extent of At Ghurair's incomplete works.
Please note t.bat, in Jine witl-.l CJ.ause 16.5.1, the Contractor Delay Costs ~costs kKurred by• th€
.Contract-or an-d/or
other .Contractors /Subrontractors induding modifications costs); and rei evant costs witt be recovered
from you
in accordance with Clause 10.3 of the subcontract.

Yours faithfully,
