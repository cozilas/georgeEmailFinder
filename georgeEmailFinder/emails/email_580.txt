Re: RFI/0401/16577 responded for Doors with Fire Alarm

Dear Sir,
We are in receipt of your RFI response referenced (1) above, wherein you listed 101no. of doors
requiring to have fire safety connections.
Please note that the mentioned RFI response requires an Engineer’s Instruction. Specifically, the said RFI
was raised to clarify the door hardware in relation to fire interphase requirements. These doors were
previously instructed with EIs 681 series and Door Schedule 31, not requiring fire safety connections.
Thus, the Engineer’s response to the number of doors require having fire safety connections, is a
requirement which was not previously incorporated in the EIs and Door Schedules. Hence, this is a
design change and an Engineer’s Instruction along with updated IFC drawings are required to enable us
to implement the changes and proceed accordingly.
Additionally, you are kindly reminded that e-notice “SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26, E-Notice No. – E0007 –
Discrepancies between Door Schedule Rev 31, SACS, Data and Power Provisions” and other
correspondence have been submitted previously, informing you about the aforementioned door issues.
Your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction is required, failing which the works are
likely to be delayed and/or disrupted.
We reserve our rights under the Contract pursuant to Sub-Clause 27.1 (Contractor’s Claims) to an
extension of the Time for Completion and additional Costs arising from the above described event.
Yours faithfully,
