Subject: Reply letter- Non-Conformance Installation of Frameless Glass Screen, Glass Fins
Dear Sir,
and Associated Works
We acknowledge receipt of your letter referenced in (9} above regarding your reply to TCA JV letter
referenced (5}.
However, kindly note that the tolerance of the glass fabrication/installation is 1mm, where the As-built
is
showing the fins' locations deviated from the models. At the time of installation most of the shop
drawings for
this area were code 3, which makes any BIM codes void as models should be updated to follow code 3
comments.
As you were aware that only approved and coordinated shop drawings are to be used for fabrication
and any
site installation. Therefore you went ahead with manufacturing and installation at your own risk.
The Engineer's letter that was conveyed to you through TCA JV letter referenced (5} above, clearly
observed
in his report that your site installation is different as compared to the shop drawings, thus making shop
drawings and models obsolete, until AGCA proceed to the remedial works.
The continuous negligence of not following the approved shop drawings on site installations is the basis
of this
non-conformance.
In addition, please note that at the attached study which is represents the comparison between the
working
points from the model and the IFC, the X values most of them are matching or within tolerance however
the
site as-built was wrongly installed which led AGCA to rectify. You are hereby reminded of your
obligations as set out under the Subcontract which include, Subcontract
Clause 16.1.1 provides that you are obliged to progress the Subcontract Works with due expedition and
without delay, and should neither delay nor adversely affect the performance of TCAJV or Other
Subcontractors.
Moreover, Subcontract, Clause 16.6.1 provides that:
((If the Subcontractor fails to comply with the approved Subcontract Programme, the Subcontractor
shall
without limitation indemnify and hold the Contractor harmless against and from the costs, losses and
expenses
( ... ) incurred by the Contractor in connection with the Subcontractor's delays {"Contractor Delay
Costs").
Contractor Delay Costs incurred by the Contractor shall be quantified by the Contractor at the time of
such

losses and claimed under clause 10.3 {Subcontractor's Claims). These costs and losses shall be
recoverable by
the Contractor against the Subcontractor as compensation for the losses suffered by the Contractor as a
result
of the Subcontractor's delay or non-compliance with the approved Subcontract Programme and
irrespective of
whether or not the Subcontractor's delay or non-compliance results in the Contractor incurring liability
for
delay damages to the Employer under the Contract."
It is noted that any delays, costs, loses and/or expenses incurred by us and/or Other Subcontractor Is
arising as
a result of the above delays shall be at your risk and recovered from your account in accordance with
the
Subcontract clauses 10.3, 16.6.1 and other relevant clauses.
This is for your utmost attention and immediate action.
Yours faithfully,
