Subject:RE: Notification of Back Charge - Store Yard - Unsecured East Airfield near ATCC
Dear Sir,
The Contractor acknowledges receipt of letter reference (1) whereby the Subcontractor rejects the
notification issued by the Contractor in respect of the deployment of security measures at the laydown
areas near ATCC since 07 April 2018. To be clear:
The Subcontractor’s statement that the store yard was / is not being utilised by the Subcontractor is
refuted by the Contractor who re-affirms that the Subcontractor has been identified as one of the
companies benefiting from the use of this land. In addition to being responsible for the ‘security of
specific subcontract areas on site’, the responsibility matrix also identifies the Subcontractor as the
party responsible for the ‘maintenance of stores, covered stores and yards’. Moreover, the Contractor
feels prudent to remind the Subcontractor that to ‘provide own security for own working and storage
areas’ is also an integral part of the Subcontractor’s scope (please refer to paragraph 4.2.12 of Schedule
0 [Scope of the Subcontract Works]).
Although the Subcontractor’s comments on its compliance with both the Project’s and HSE procedures
have been noted, the Contractor reiterates that the Subcontractor has failed to provide the requisite
security at the store yard; hence, the Contractor’s letter reference (2).
Finally, the Contractor confirms that the provisions of Sub-Clause 10.3 [Contractor’s Claims] of the
Conditions of Subcontract have been complied with whilst giving reasonable notice to the Subcontractor
that deductions may be applied for the security measures deployed by the Contractor on behalf of the
Subcontractor at the store yard.
The Contractor trusts the above is clear and considers this matter closed.
Yours faithfully,
