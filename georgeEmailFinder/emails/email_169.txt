Subject Notice to correct - The Siphonic Drainage System Works - Inspection Report and
Certification by Specialist UV Systems
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence (1) regarding the Siphonic Drainage System Worl<s Inspection Report and Certification by Specialist UV Systems.
The Engineer in correspondence (1) noted that the Siphonic Drainage System works from the upper
roof to the lower roof is substantially completed and the related piping of the risers have also been
completed apart from 2 no. Siphonic riser pipe connections to manhole which remain outstanding.
The personnel from UV Systems (the Designer of the Siphonic system) visited the site to inspect the
overall system and their inspection report is still pending submission for the Engineer's review. This is
further impacting the submission of the system's related As Built Drawings and the attached email is
referring to commercial issues between PCEJV and the 3rd party which is delaying the aforementioned
submissions.
The Contractor has failed to manage their Subcontractor and to implement the required measures to
address this issue. Due to the serious risk that this non-compliar~ce poses to the Project, we hereby

issue this Notice to Correct pursuant to Clause 12.10 of the Conditions of Contract regarding their
Subcontractor's performance and we request that pursuant to Clause 12.10.2 of the Conditions of
Contract, the Contractor shall ensure that PCEJV's performance is immediately rectified.
Based on the above, you are requested to resolve the matter with your Subcontractor at the earliest
and submit the inspection report and the system's certification without further delays in order to
facilitate the As-Built drawing submissions.
The Contractor shall be held fully responsible for all the delays associated with this activity and we
hereby reserve t he Employer's rights pursuant to Clause 10.3 of the Conditions of Cont ract for any
further delays associated with the above.
Yours faithfully,
