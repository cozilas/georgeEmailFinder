Subject:MCC Inspection of Pier 4 Cameras
Dear Sir,
Further to receipt of the Engineerâ€™s above reference letter the Contractor wishes to respond as follow.
We raise our serious concern regarding the introduction of Monitoring and Control Centre (MCC) as the
Regulatory Agency for the Certification and Approval of the MTB Video Surveillance System (VSS) at this
stage of the project. We are not and were never aware that MCC requirements formed part of our scope
of work or were part of our obligations under Sub-Clause 12.11.1(c) (Cooperation) of the Conditions of
Contract.
The requested inspection to take place during the fourth week of September 2018 was cancelled due to
the short notice that was given in the above referenced letter received on the 26 September 2018.
Further, reference to the MCC requirements, we inform you that we have not officially been issued with
the documents and therefore cannot assure any contractual compliance with these new requirements.
However, we have already submitted all our technical, engineering and WIR approval documents
complying with the project specifications to CMA. Should there be any deviance or discrepancy then the
Engineer is required to issue a formal instruction to clarify any ambiguity as per the mechanisms
provided under the Conditions of Contract.
You are also further reminded, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement and Amendment Number 8
(SAA8) Variations Clauses 2.29, 2.30 and 2.31, notwithstanding the terms of Conditions of Contract

Clause 20.3 (Variation Procedure) the Engineer shall not instruct any Variation after the Amendment
Effective Date of 4 September 2018 unless all the requirements of these SAA8 Clauses have been
fulfilled in their entirety.
This is for your information and we will revert back to you on the site readiness in due course.
Yours faithfully
