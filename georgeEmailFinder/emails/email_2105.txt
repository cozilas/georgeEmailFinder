Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to the Engineer's Instruction pursuant to Sub-Clause 13.1.1 under letter reference
2) instructing the design and construction of a third pedestrian entrance at grade including related MEP,
Architectural Finishes and Utility diversions at Qatar National Museum Station and the subsequent
Contractor's financial proposal under reference 1).

Further to the latest discussions and the Engineer's Assistant's request, the Contractor encloses
herewith its revised financial proposal for the optimized Option 3a.

The estimated MEP, architectural finishes and utility relocation design and construction cost is provided
for budgeting purposes only, and it does not include any other additional cost that may arise as a
consequence of the Engineer's Instruction, such as the cost of rework or abortive design, especially for
the Qatar National Museum station concourse level. These costs (if any) will be addressed under
separate cover.

For the avoidance of doubt, this submission supersedes the financial proposal submitted under
reference 1). We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.
Yours faithfully,
