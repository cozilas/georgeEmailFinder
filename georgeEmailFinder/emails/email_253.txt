Subject: Reply - De-Scoping of Secondary Steel Structure for Double Height Pavilions
Dear Sir,
We write in response to your letter referenced in (10) above wherein you are requesting reimbursement
for the purchased materials due the de-scoping of the four (4) Double Height Pavilions.
As advised during our Commercial Meeting on 7th June 2017, we are unable to verify the quantity and
quality of such materials as there are still stored in your factory, hence you have not submitted any
evidence (i.e. photos, proof of payment etc.) to support your purported claim.
In light of the above, we will only be able to advise you of our evaluation and decision of the said matter,
once such materials have been delivered to site and inspected by us.
In addition, we have enclosed herewith our current assessment of your Revised Cost Proposal for your
review and consideration.
We look forward to agreeing and closing out this issue in order to issue a Variation Order accordingly.
This is for your necessary action.
Yours faithfully,
