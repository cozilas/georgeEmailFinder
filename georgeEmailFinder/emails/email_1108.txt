Subject: Ban of Anel Emirates Project Execution Board Member- Mr. Zafer Gene
Dear Sir,
With reference to Anel's letter reference: {1) above, please be advised that the Contractor's instruction
to
return Mr. Zafer Gene's Site Access Badge and the Vehicle Pass is in conformity with the Contractor's
decision to remove Mr. Zafer Gene from the positions of Subcontractor's Representative and the Project
Manager, which has been notified to the Subcontractor via the Contractor's letters reference: {6) and {3)
above.
Please be advised that, neither the Subcontract recognises a 'Project Execution Board', nor has the
Contractor approved Mr. Zafer Gene as a member of such project execution board, as mentioned in the
Subcontractor's letter reference: (1) above. The temporary provision of Mr. Zafer Gene's Site Access
Badge and the Vehicle Pass, after the aforementioned removal, was based on the Subcontractor's
request
and for a limited period.
In light of the above, the Contractor advises the Subcontractor to comply with the above inst ruction
and
return Mr. Zafer Gene's Site Access Badge and the Vehicle Pass immediately.
Yours faithfully,
