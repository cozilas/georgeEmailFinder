Subject:Clause 27.1.1: Notice of Claim – Delay Notice No. 0077
Engineer’s Instruction No. 764 – Suspension – Glass Cladding in North Lounge Area and Engineer’s
Instruction No. 765 – Proposal – Omit Class Cladding
Dear Sir
On 28 January 2019, we received two Engineer's Instructions (‘EI’) under cover of your letters ref: (1)
and (2) above, associated with the Glass Cladding Works in North Lounge Area to Level L2.0 of the
Central Processor Area, both of which will have time and cost implications; hence this Delay Notice.
Firstly, by EI No. 764 (ref: 1) you instructed us, in accordance with Conditions of Contract Clause 11.3
and 16.7, ‘to suspend the Glass Cladding Works in North Lounge Room 88.C.L20.0711.05.AS ‘Lounge
Lobby Tenant 047’ [as indicated in the sketch attached thereto entitled ‘Base Build Alteration Plan’]’
EI No. 764 further stated that ‘the tenant (Etihad) will install its own cladding system in the locations
shown therefore please suspend all Works necessary to minimise any abortive works accordingly.’
Secondly, by EI No. 765 (ref: 2) you instructed us, in accordance with Conditions of Contract Clause 11.3
and Sub-Clause 20.1.1(b), ‘to provide [you] a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) and proposal, for the
omission of the Glass Cladding Works in North Lounge Room 88.C.L20.0711.05.AS ‘Lounge Lobby Tenant
047’ [as indicated in the attached sketch]’ (this being the same sketch issued vide EI No. 764).
We complied with your instruction and on or about 28 February 2019, submitted a ROM by way of
Proposal Request Response (PRR) No. PRR/0401/0013-TCAJV Rev. 00 (ref: 3), which provided you with
an initial valuation of the associated works in the amount of AED 443,560.47. This reflects inter alia the
value of abortive work and additional shop drawings consequent on the Employer’s decision to change
the scope of its design within the tenant area to Sections 5.15B and 5.14D to Level L2.0. In which
respect, there has been a successive number of e-mails exchanged between us since February 2019 to
date [May 2019] primarily associated with us endeavouring to agree upon the amount and value of work
previously installed, as well as determine and agree upon the value of materials that were procured,
manufactured and delivered but had yet to be installed, which are now omitted.
Not only has the omitted works yet to be agreed between us at the date of writing [22 May 2019], but
we are also understand the tenant’s revised scope [cladding system] has yet to fully crystallise.
Therefore, in accordance with Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1, we hereby notify
you of our entitlement to claim:
(i)
An extension of the Time for Completion of the Works pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.9.1(a)
‘Consequence of Suspension’, or alternatively, Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c) ‘act of prevention’; and
(ii)
An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.2 pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.9
‘Consequence of Suspension’, or in the alternative, damages for breach of Contract.
Interim and/or final details of the time impacts and adjustment to the Contract Price will be provided in
due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27 .1.5{a), (b) and (c).
Yours faithfully,
