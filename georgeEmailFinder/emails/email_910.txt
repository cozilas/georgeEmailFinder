Subject: RE: Claim for Damage- CSC Request for Loading Access in Skylight CL-01
Dear_Sir,
The Contractor confirms receipt of letter references (1) and (2) wherein the Subcontractor claims that
personnel employed by the Subcontractor China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC)
damaged the steel frame whilst undertaking lifting operations through the main roof skylight Cll. The
Subcontractor further argues that it incurred additional rectification costs in the amount of AED
2,688.00.
Firstly, the Contractor notes that, in its letter references (1) and (2), the Subcontractor does not provide
any
evidence or explanation on how the Subcontract Works were protected. Moreover, these letters attach
a
recollection of pictures showing lifting operations taking place; yet, it can be observed that no
protection
measures were taken by the Subcontractor to protect the painted steel frame from being 'scratched' by
the
crane's cables, chains or lifted beams.
The Contractor reminds that, pursuant to Clauses 15.6.2 and 24.2.1 of the Conditions of Subcontract,
the
Subcontractor shall remain responsible for the care, custody, safekeeping and protection of each part of
the
Subcontract Works until such time as the Taking-Over Certificate is issued by the Contractor.
Please be advised that the Contractor is of the opinion that, in its letter references (1) and (2), the
Subcontractor has not demonstrated contractual entitlement to reimbursement of the alleged
rectification
costs. Notwithstanding this, the Contractor confirms that the Subcontractor's claim has been forwarded
to

CSCEC for its review. Should CSCEC provide any response, it will be forwarded to the Subcontractor in
due
course.
Yours faithfully,
