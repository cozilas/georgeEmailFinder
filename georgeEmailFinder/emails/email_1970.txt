Dear Sir,

The Contractor notes that the Engineer’s Assistant’s reminder of reference 2) coincided with the
Contractor’s response of reference 1).

Furthermore the Contractor notes that the Engineer’s Assistant’s letters of references 1) and 4) to 11)
were responded to via letter reference 3).

The Contractor therefore kindly requests the Engineer’s Assistant to remove its letters referenced above
from the list of outstanding correspondence enclosed to the MoMs of the bi-weekly commercial review
meeting.

Yours faithfully,
