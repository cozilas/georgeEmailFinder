Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer’s Assistant’s letter of reference 2) which ought to be issued as an Instruction
pursuant to General Condition (“GC”) 13.1.1 of Volume 3 of the Contract, the Contractor encloses

herewith full particulars of its actual design costs related to the implementation of post-contract issued
Station Area Planning (SAP) drawings.

As a direct consequence of this instruction to vary the works, the Contractor instructed Atkins to
perform additional design works and has received notice for additional payment by Atkins for the same.
The said notice and subsequent determination / paid amounts can be summarized as per the following
table:

FCN 071
(SAP & AGS)

Amount claimed by Atkins

(QAR) ALYSJ JV Determination
(QAR) Amount paid to date
(QAR)
Atkins Lead Design

22,331,687.51 12,637,527.45 12,637,527.45

Atkins MEP Design

6,534,024.00

Atkins Total

3,888,134.42

2,916,100.81

28,865,711.51 16,525,661.87 15,553,628.26

Table 1) FCN 071: Amounts claimed by Atkins, ALYSJ JV Determination for the same and payments to
date

As detailed herein, the Contractor estimates that QAR 16,525,661.87 is a fair and reasonable
compensation to Atkins against the originally claimed value of QAR 28,865,711.51 which was, at the
Contractor’s opinion, overstated both in terms of the applicable staff rates and the respective time
spent.

The Contractor has enclosed as attachments 1) and 2) to this letter respectively both its determination
of FCN 071 and the respective notice for additional payment as received by Atkins.

Whilst noting that none of its aforementioned determination amounts have been agreed with Atkins as
full and sole compensation with the entire balance being the subject of an ongoing dispute, the
Contractor has nevertheless paid the amount of QAR 15,553,628.26 already, for which proof of payment
in the form of electronic payment (wire transfer) documents has been enclosed as attachment 3).

In any event, and whilst noting that the FCN 071 determination amount may be subject to further
change, the Contractor kindly requests the Employer to proceed with an interim, on-account payment of
its actual design costs incurred plus 12% for profits and overheads, in the net amount of QAR
17,420,063.65.

Such payment would be of invaluable assistance to the continued financing of the Project.

Yours faithfully,
