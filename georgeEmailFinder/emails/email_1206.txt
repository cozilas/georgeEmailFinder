Subject: Additional Management of Atlas Security
Dear Sir,
Further to the receipt of the above referenced correspondence regarding the extension of support to
the
Security Subcontractor we confirm that the information requested was provided via our revised ROM
283
issued to the Engineer on 27 November 2017.
As noted within the aforementioned ROM, it is expected that additional funds will be required to
continue
to provide support to ATLAS Security until the expected completion date. It is our belief that additional
costs will be incurred from the end of April 2018, at which time all additional support will cease.
We await the receipt of an appropriate Variation Order to continue the provided support beyond the
original AED 30 million budget.
Yours faithfully
