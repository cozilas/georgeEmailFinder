Dear Islam
Thank you for your email response.
Please note that the Concord Management already has in possession the 4th cheque you are referring
to in your email below for the 4th and last payment of our office premises. The cheque is dated 15
September 2020 and it is entirely the Concord’s management decision whether they wish to cash in the
cheque on the mentioned date or not. We assure you that the 4th cheque can be cashed in on the
mentioned date, should the Concord Management wish to do so.

However, before cashing-in the cheque, we would advise you to take into consideration our request
submitted to the Concord Management for an early termination of our lease sent to you via our email
dated 7 July 2020 [6:30 PM].
With respect to our request for early termination, please be informed that since we have not been able
to reach an agreement in regard to early termination, and have exhausted all means of communication,
we inform you that we will be filing an official complaint with the Rent Disputes Settlement Centre in
Dubai.
In the meantime, the Concord Management has no right and cannot refuse, restrict, and/or deny us
moving in or out, our goods and furniture, since we are following the correct procedures.
As far as we are concerned, we are following the correct procedures as per the Lease Contract, the
Concord Tower’s guidelines and the UAE law.
We also note that the premises have been leased unfurnished and whatever furniture is inside, is our
property and we have every right to move them.
In view of the above, kindly expedite the issuance of the moving-out permit as requested, for Saturday
12 September 2020.
Yours faithfully,
