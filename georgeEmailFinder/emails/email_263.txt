Subject Notice to Correct {Clause 12.10 Conditions of Contract)- Shortage of Manpower
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence (1) wherein the Engineer notified the Contractor of his
concerns in relation to the levels of manpower on site and requested that the Contractor corrects the
decline in their resources. The Contractor is responsible for the acts, omissions or defaults of any and
all Subcontractors and their agents or employees, as if they were acts, omissions or defaults of the
Contractor (Clause 12.9.6 Conditions of Contract).
The Contractor is referred to the table below which identifies a few Subcontractors where the current
resources and the variance in Direct/Indirect levels are reflected as of 15 November 2019:
the contractor is requested to immediately rectify the above shortages which impact the performance
of their Subcontractors and ensure that their subcontractors allocate the required resources for the
rectification of all non-compliances and to ensure adherence to the target schedule for completion.
Yours faithfully,
