Subject: RE: Delay in Submission of As-built Drawings
Dear Sir,

Further to the receipt of letter (1) regarding the Subcontractor's schedule for the forecast submission of
as built drawings, the Contractor refers the Subcontractor to the attached email correspondence
whereby the Engineer confirmed that the 200 no. as-built drawings submitted by the Subcontractor
have been assigned a Code-1 for CAD compliance.
The Contractor is aware of the delays being currently incurred by the Design Consultant in returning the
Subcontractor's submitted as-built drawings; yet, the Contractor further notes that the Subcontractor
shall not withhold all other submittals on this basis. Moreover, there is no reason why the Subcontractor
should refuse to furnish the Contractor with the schedule of forecast as-built submissions which has
been requested by the Contractor in numerous occasions.
The Contractor reiterates therefore its request that a schedule of forecast as-built submissions is
provided by the Subcontractor without further delay.
Yours faithfully,
