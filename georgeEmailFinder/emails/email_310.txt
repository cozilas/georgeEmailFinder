Subject: RE: Progress of Prl Works- Notice of Delay {Ill)
Dear Sir,
The Contractor confirms receipt of letter reference (1) wherein the Subcontractor refutes that any
delays
were incurred in the Prl and which attaches the Subcontractor's updated target programme for the Prl
works, to be clear:
The Contractor raised the Work Inspection Request (WIR) for the mock-up and the Engineer
inspected the area accordingly; however, the Engineer refused to examine the mock-up with both
the Employer and the design Consultant (KPF) due to the Subcontractor's failure to have
completed and prepared for inspection either a three bay benchmark or a full bay (see email
attached).
The Subcontractor claims that previous revisions of the target programme considered that the
glass installation only would be completed by 30 December 2017; however, the Contractor
records that the glass installation is still missing numerous glass units because they were either
broken or rejected due to quality issues, i.e. the glass installation is not yet completed. Further,
the Subcontractor has recently advised that the outstanding glass units will arrive to the Country
on 17 February 2018; hence, the Contractor shares its concerns that the new completion date
included in the last revision of the Subcontractor's target programme (i.e. 28 February 2018)
seems unlikely to happen.
The Contractor rejects the completion date for the PrD/PrL interface flashing included in the last
revision of the programme and emphasizes that March 2018 is a target date that has never met
with the Contractor's approval. For the record, the slippage to the completion date for the
PrD/PrL interface flashing derives from the lack of draughtsman resources at the Subcontractor's
current disposal and subsequent absence of fabrication drawings; hence, it is entirely attributable
to the Subcontractor.
The Contractor further notes that the Subcontractor's workforce continues to be way below the
required level to meet the target dates. For instance, the manpower working on the Prl is currently at 32
of which 4 have been sent to help out in the factory; however, the Contractor
estimates that at least SO workers are required to meet the deadlines.
Finally, the Contractor regrets that the Subcontractor's proposed target programmes cannot be
relied upon and that no efforts appear to be made to avoid further slippages to the completion
dates. For instance, the following activities should have been completed by end of January 2018 in
accordance with the last programme attached to the Subcontractor's letter reference (1):
L1S and L2S completely- Failed
L3S Gl rockwool- Failed

L4S Gl rockwool- Failed
In view of the constant slippage to completion dates included in the Subcontractor's target programmes,
please be again notified that, in the opinion of the Contractor, the performance of the PrL works is such
that it may result in the Contractor not achieving its own obligations under the Contract. Therefore, the
Subcontractor is requested to take all reasonable steps to mitigate its delay and ensure completion of
these works in accordance with its contractual obligations under Clause 8.1.2 and Clause 16.1.1 of the
Conditions of Subcontract, propose satisfactory mitigation measures and revise its target programme.
The Contractor confirms that its rights under the provisions of Clause 10.3 [Contractor's Claims] and
Clause 16.6 [Delay Damages] of the Conditions of Subcontract are hereby reserved.
Yours faithfully,
