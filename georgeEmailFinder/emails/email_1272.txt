Requests for Details Approval via RFI

Dear Sir,
Please find attached a schedule of pending MIR’s which basis of rejection is that some minor details
were constructed despite not being included in the relevant shop drawings; however, in all cases the
correspondent shop drawings had already been approved with code 1 status.

Please note that the re-submission of code 1 approved shop drawings at this juncture, when the
pertaining works have already been executed and the specialized Design Consultant in no longer present
on Site, does not make any practical sense. Therefore, the Contractor politely requests the Engineer to
review and approve the missing details via dedicated ‘request for information’ submissions. This
proposed methodology, which has met with the Engineer’s approval in previous instances, will prevent
both the Contractor and the Employer from expending substantial design effort and incurring
unnecessary costs.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Contractor confirms that these design details will be included in the asbuilt documentation.
Yours faithfully,
