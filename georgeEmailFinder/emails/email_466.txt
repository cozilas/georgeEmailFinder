Subject: Clause 27.1.1: Notice of Claim, Delay Notice SAAB-0020-ICT-WLAN-ETIHAD
Dear Sir,
Lounges- Supply of Wi Fi Access Points
We acknowledge receipt of your letter reference (1} and provide our detailed response below.
We note your comments concerning the procedure set down in Clause 2.26 of the Settlement
Agreement and Amendment No. 8 ('SAA8'} and we have now put measures in place to ensure that we
comply with this process.
It is, however, our view that SAA8 does not obviate the requirement for the Contractor to issue a notice
of claim for extension of time and/or additional costs in circumstances where the Contractor's progress
of the Works is adversely affected by a breach of Contract or an act of prevention (such as in the
circumstances which form the subject matter of our letter reference (2}). In such instances, while we will
certainly bring the matter to the attention of the Engineer and the Employer by way of the SAA8 Clause
2.26 email notice procedure, we are of the view that we are also obliged to issue a parallel notice under
the provisions of Clause 27.1 of the Contract. Should we be incorrect on our understanding of t lh is
matter, we would be obliged if the Employer would issue a letter confirming that the notices
requirements under Clause 27.1 of the Contract are superseded by the provisions of SAA8 and are thus
rendered redundant.
In the meanwhile, your reminder to us concerning the procedural requirements set down in the
Contract governing claims is noted, and we will endeavor to comply with these. More importantly (in
our view), in keeping with the purpose and spirit of SAA8 we intend to keep the Engineer and the
Employer appraised (including by way of the Risk Mitigation Meetings) of the impact of any delays such
that these can be investigated in a timely manner and dealt with appropriately by the responsible Party
(or Parties) .
Yours faithfully,
