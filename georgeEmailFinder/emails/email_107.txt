Subject Failure to Attend the Weekly Subsidence Progress Meeting dated 23 March 2020

Dear Sir,
We write with reference to the Weekly Progress Meeting which was scheduled to take place
on 23 March 2020 and we record the Contractor's failure to attend without providing a valid reason.
In accordance with Specification Section 013103, Clause 1.4.0.11 the Contractor's team should be
available to attend project meetings to enable all issues to be resolved.
The Contractor is required to attend all Weekly Meetings given the critical stage of the Project. We
trust this incident shall not be repeated and the Contractor shall adhere to their obligations.
Yours faithfully,
