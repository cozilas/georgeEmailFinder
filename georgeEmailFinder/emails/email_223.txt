Subject: RE: Additional ACP Cladding at Fa!;ade & Gypsum Interface at PrD Mezzanine
Dear Sir,
The Contractor confirms receipt of the Subcontractor's notice of claim reference (1} in respect of the
Engineer's response to request for information (RFis) nos. (2} and (3}. Firstly, it is noted that the
Engineer's responses to the RFis referred by the Subcontractor, (2} and (3}, were received in June 2016
and July 2015 respectively, i.e. it has taken the Subcontractor two and a half years to raise a notice in
respect of the additional works proposed within these RFis.
The Contractor feels prudent to remind the Subcontractor that it is obliged, pursuant to Sub-Clause
27.1.1 of the Conditions of Subcontract, to give a timely notification to the Contractor if it considered
itself to be 'entitled to any reimbursement of additional Costs incurred, an adjustment to the
Subcontract Price and/or any other costs or damages, under any provision of the Subcontract or
otherwise'. The Subcontractor not only failed to give notice within 21 days but it also significantly
exceeded such period. In addition to the Subcontractor's failure to comply with its notification
obligations, the Subcontractor also failed to comply with the other provisions of Sub-Clause 27.1;
including keeping and promptly submitting contemporary records (Sub-Clause 27.1.4}, submission of
fully detailed interim claims at monthly intervals (Sub-Clause 27.1.5} etc. As a consequence, the
Contractor may have been barred from any entitlement under the Contract and prevented from
obtaining additional payment and/or an extension to the Time for Completion in respect of this
Employer's related event.

Notwithstanding the above, the Subcontractor's letter (1} has been forwarded to the Engineer thus
requesting its instruction to proceed. Meanwhile, the Subcontractor is requested to submit its
commercial proposal for the implementation of a Variation for onward submission to the Engineer I
Employer without further delay.
Yours faithfully,
