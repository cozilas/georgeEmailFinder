Dear sir
We acknowledge receipt of your letter referenced in (3} above requesting us to return the Bond for

cancellation by your bank.
However, please be advised that the proper procedure as per Subcontract as well as the conditions
stated
within the Advance Payment Guarantee should be followed and complied with.
Therefore in this regard, we cannot automatically return one (1) Bond but the val~e of all four (4) Bonds
shall
be reduced proportionately by the same percentage of the amount already recovered as indicated in the
latest Interim Payment Certificate.
Â·This is for your information and record.
Yours faithfully,
