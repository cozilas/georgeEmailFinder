Dear Sir,
Pursuant to the Engineer’s Instruction No 119/119a we kindly request the Employer to issue a
Consignment Clearance Authorization (CCA) Duty Exemption Letter to Abu Dhabi Custom Authorities for
the Imported Material’s in connection with the delivery of the Center Space Chandeliers.
Please find attached herewith for your reference, the summary providing details required for the
delivery of the shipped materials.
We have just received the attached shipping documentation from our Subcontractor and we are mindful
that the shipment is scheduled to arrive at Jebel Ali Port on 26th March 2018, thus we respectfully
request you to process the requisite documentation in order to obtain the necessary exemption letter
from the Employer and to facilitate the release of the shipment from the port.

Yours faithfully,
