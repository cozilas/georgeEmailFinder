Subject:SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0125
Overdue Responses to the Contractor’s Material Submittals – Architectural, Structural, Civil, and MEP –
as at 29 August 2019
Dear Sir
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and / or circumstances described in
Annex A may cause delay and/or disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
The matters described in Annex A concern potential delays to the Works due to your failure to respond
to various Material submittals within the review times expressly stipulated in the Contract.
Potential Impact
Delay and disruption due to the events and circumstances outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
likely to impact on achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required:
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Specifically we urge you to review and respond to Contractor’s Material submittals without further
undue delay. Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned immediately upon receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
Description of the Event
In the period between 25 June 2019 and 24 July 2019, we submitted the following five (5) Material
Submittals seeking your review and approval of the various Structural, Architectural, Civil, and MEP
materials detailed therein, in the manner set out and summarised Table 1 below.

We again remind you that Article 1.3 of Specification Section 013300 ‘Submittal Procedures’ governs the
processing time by which you are contractually obligated to respond to our Submittals. On the basis
that each of the five (5) Material Submittals listed in Table 1 are shown to comprise Rev. 00, Rev. 01 and
Rev. 04 submittals, then these ought to have been responded to by the Engineer 21, 14 and 7 calendar
days later respectively, i.e. in the period between 9 July 2019 and 14 August 2019. However, the
information shown in Table 1 above, indicates that at the cut-off date associated with the preparation of
this Notice (i.e. 29 August 2019), the Engineer exceeded, and is continuing to exceed the review periods
expressly stipulated in the Contract by upwards of 51 calendar days.
Potential Impact:
It is our consideration that your delayed and overdue responses to the Material Submittals listed in
Table 1 is hampering our ability to procure, deliver and subsequently install the noted materials for the
Project, and as such will directly affect our ability to complete the related Works, especially at such a
late stage of the Project. This will invariably impact upon our ability to achieve Milestone MS09B, and
may also prevent us from achieving Substantial Completion (i.e. Milestone MS09C).
Yours faithfully,
