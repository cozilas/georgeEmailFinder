The information recorded in Table 1 shows the NOC reference number, the revision, the description of
works and unit/area number, plus the date the request for an NOC was made, and when the response to
our request for access was due; the latter being based on a nominal three-day turn-around time. In
other words, approval is traditionally granted within three (3) days from our request being issued.
However, Table 1 further records that at the cut-off date associated with preparation of this E-Notice
0244 (i.e. 6 April 2020), none of the NOCs have been responded to. Therefore, this demonstrates that
for all of the 28 NOC requests listed therein, the responses have exceeded and by all accounts are
continuing to exceed the three-day turn-around response time by periods of upwards of 18 calendar
days late. This is unacceptable. We have already issued a reminder to you vide our e-mail dated 6 April
2020 (copy attached).
The purpose of this E-notice is two-fold: Firstly, we wish to notify you of appreciable concerns we have
in relation to a distinct failure on your part to process our requests for re-entry promptly and issue the
approved NOCs in an timely manner, and Secondly, notify you of the invariable impact that this failure
has on our ability to complete the MEP, HVAC testing and Testing and Commissioning of Lighting Control
System, amongst other things; and accordingly urge you to ensure that the responsible third-party (i.e.
Employer’s Tenants) responds to the requested NOC issuance in a prompt and timely manner.
Potential Impact:
Acts of prevention such as these will at this stage of the Works, prevent us from obtaining the Building
Completion Certificate (BCC). This is critical in us achieving completion of Milestone MS09B.
Consequently, the more we are prevented from working due to the combined effects of the above, the
more likely this will prevent us from achieving Substantial Completion (i.e. Milestone MS09C).
Action Required:
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works;
specifically, we urge you assist with the prompt processing of our Re-Entry Permits allowing us access as
well as urging the Employer’s Other Contractor to work with us so as not to delay our Works. Kindly
ensure that such matters are resolved immediately from the date of receipt of this Notice.
Yours faithfully,
