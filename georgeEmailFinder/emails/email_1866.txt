Dear Sir

The contractor is writing with reference to the ongoing flooding situation at Souq Waqif station.

On the 25th of August 2015 a fountain of water appeared and caused severe flooding in the excavated
area of the aforementioned station. This flooding has been brought under control by the introduction of
3 heavy duty water pumps and installation of a separate discharge system, as the current system did not
have the capacity required. This situation will have an impact on both time and cost to the project

The Contractor hereby by gives notice of the delay as per clause 8.4.2 and notice of claim as per clause
20.1.2 of volume 3 â€“Conditions of Contract.

Yours faithfully,
