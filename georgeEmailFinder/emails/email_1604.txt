Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer’s Instruction of reference 6) issued pursuant to General Condition (“GC”) 13.1.1
of Volume 3 of the Contract, the Contractor encloses herewith full particulars in relation to the abortive
and / or additional design works pursuant to its GC 13.2.2 obligations.

This evaluation of abortive design costs does not rely upon the actual costs brought forward by M/s
Atkins and the Contractor’s respective determinations but on the same principle put forward by the
Engineer’s Assistant via letter reference 3) in quantifying the abortive design costs in relation to the
cross-passages

Provided that the instruction of letter reference 6) was received in parallel with those of letter
references 5) and 7), and, that the effect in both cases has been the occurrence of concurrent abortive
design in relation to the passageways, the Contractor concludes that, in the context of this price and
methodology, the cost for abortive design arising out of the instruction of letter reference 5) is deemed
to be included within the valuation of letter reference 2).

All necessary proof comprising of the relevant outgoing design transmittals to the DVE prior to the
receipt of the Engineer’s Instruction of letter reference 6), i.e. the comprehensive ‘list of deliverables’
which forms the basis of the Contractor’s entitlement can be found in attachment 2) of letter reference
2).

On the basis of the Engineer’s Assistant pricing methodology therefore, the Contractor has thus far
evaluated several distinct cases of abortive design costs, all of which have been summarized in table 1)
below. The relevant head of claims by Atkins have also been included for information only, so as to
enable a direct comparison of the amounts involved.
