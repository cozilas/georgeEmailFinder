Subject:Clause 27.1.1: Notice of Claim – Delay Notice No. 239 [post-SAA8]
UAE Government Announcement dated 23 March 2020
Change in Applicable Laws
Dear Sirs,
We refer to the following announcement made by Emirates News Agency (WAM) dated 23 March 2020
ref: (1) (copy attached) in which the Ministry of Interior called upon members of the public to stay at
home:
‘ABU DHABI, 23rd March, 2020 (WAM) -- The UAE government has called upon the public to stay at
home unless it's absolutely necessary to get essential supplies, such as food and medicine, or perform
essential jobs.
In a joint statement tonight, the Ministry of Interior and the National Emergency and Crisis and Disasters
Management Authority urged UAE citizens, residents, visitors and all those living in the nation, to

comply with the instructions and guidelines issued by competent health and security authorities,
primarily limiting social contacts and avoiding crowded places to ensure their safety and wellbeing.
"The public are also urged to use their own family cars with a maximum of three individuals per vehicle.
They are also advised not to visit public places and maintain social distancing protocols during family
gatherings as part of the precautionary measures taken to ensure public health and safety," added the
statement.
The two authorities also urged everyone not to visit hospitals except for critical or emergency cases and
to use face masks.
"Additional instructions will be issued later involving the use of public transport, taxis and other means
of transportation," said the statement.
The UAE law on communicable diseases, which includes fines and jail terms, will be enforced against all
violators, added the statement.’’
We draw attention to the final statement. Although not expressly referenced per se, the “UAE law” to
which this refers, relates to UAE Federal Law No. 14 of 2014 on the Control of Communicable Diseases.
It is our belief that the above announcement and the reference to the UAE Federal Law No. 14 of 2014
on the Control of Communicable Diseases (copy attached), constitutes a Change in Applicable Laws in
terms of the Conditions of Contract Clause 20.6 (‘Adjustments for Changes in Applicable Law’), especially
given that the announcement was promulgated after the date of submission of our tender.
‘Applicable Laws’ is defined in the Contract (Clause 1.1) as meaning:
‘… any and all written and unwritten laws, treaties, regulations, regulatory approvals, standards,
decrees, rules, decisions, judgments, orders, injunctions, authorisations, directives and/or other legal
requirements of any Governmental Authority which are or may become during the currency of the
Contract applicable to the execution and completion and operation … of the Works, the carrying out of
the Project …’
Accordingly, with reference to the UAE Government Announcement dated 23 March 2020, the
developing circumstances, and to Chapter 5 of the Federal Law No. 14 of 2014 (Inspection and
Penalties), we hereby give notice pursuant to Clauses 14.13, 16.5.2, 20.6.1, 20.6.2, 21.2, 27.1 and 27.2 of
the Conditions of Contract of the Contract, of our entitlement to claim:
(i)
an extension of the Time for Completion for any such delay, if the Time for Completion is or will
be delayed; and
(ii)
payment of any such Cost, which shall be added to the Contract Price.
Accordingly, interim and/or final details of the associated time impacts and adjustment to the Contract
Price will be provided in due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.5 (a), (b) and (c).
Yours faithfully,
