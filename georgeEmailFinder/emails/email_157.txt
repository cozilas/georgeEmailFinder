Suspension of Works

Dear Sir,
We acknowledge the receipt of your above referenced email (2), wherein you indicate your intention to
suspend the work at site from Monday the 24 February 2020 (citing delayed payment as justification).
Please note that your email does not constitute a formal Suspension Notice nor does it comply with the
General Conditions of the Sub-contract Agreement (GCSA), namely Sub-clause 23.1.1 [Subcontractor's
Entitlement to Suspend Work]. As a result of your failure to comply with the abovementioned conditions
(providing only 4 days’ notice), we hereby reject the content of your email.
Conversely, we take this opportunity to remind you of your obligations as set out under the Subcontract
- Clause 8.1.2 [Subcontractors Obligations]. Moreover, Subcontract Clause 16.1.1 [Commencement of
Subcontract Works] provides that you are obliged to progress the Subcontract Works with due
expedition and without delay, and should neither delay nor adversely affect the performance of TCAJV
or other subcontractors. Therefore, any illegitimate suspension will be considered an abandonment of
working activities and may result in TCAJV enacting the mechanisms within the Subcontract Agreement,
namely under Sub-clause 22.1 [Notice to Correct]. Please note that any delays, costs, losses and/or
expenses incurred by us and/or Other Subcontractor/s arising as a result of your inaction, shall be
recovered from your account in accordance with Subcontract clauses 10.3 [Contractor’s Claims], 16.6.1
[Delay Damages].
Your email also makes reference to your Prolongation Claim, in which you acknowledge falls short of our
procedural requirements. Our previously issued correspondence referenced above (1), clearly states our
position on your submission, highlighting its clear deficiencies - primarily noting a distinct absence of the
required substantiation and necessary supporting particulars. Once we are in receipt of the
aforementioned documentation we will undertake a comprehensive assessment of your entitlement.
Please be informed that Executive Management are currently reviewing your payments and will advise
on the intended date of payment in due course – we appreciate your continued patience.
Yours faithfully,
