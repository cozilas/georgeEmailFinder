Subject:Subcontractor Time-Related Costs
Dear Sir,
We refer to the various submissions that you have made to us following our request for details of the
indirect time related costs that you allege you have incurred and/or forecast that you will incur in the
execution and completion of your Subcontract Works.
As noted in the related correspondence and workshops, our requests for such details followed the
direction given to us by the Engineer regarding the Subcontractors’ Cost element of our Main Contract
claim(s) for additional payment of Prolongation Cost as a result of critical delay to the Main Contract
Works. In this regard you will no doubt appreciate that whilst we have requested (and you have
provided us with) your alleged indirect time related costs over the period [date] to [date] , this period is
merely the period within which isolated days and/or periods of delay (culpable, excusable or
compensable) may occur and should not be construed as attaching liability to the Employer or to us
and/or any entitlement to you in respect of the extension of the Subcontract Time for Completion
and/or adjustment of the Subcontract Price. For the avoidance of any doubt, we do not consider the
cost submissions requested by us and subsequently provided by you as constituting claims made in

accordance with the Subcontract; indeed the Subcontract provisions regarding Subcontractor claims are
clear and your related obligations will not be waived and must be complied with fully for you to attain
any entitlement.
Notwithstanding the status of your submissions, we have reviewed the costs and related details that you
and all other subcontractors have provided to us with the objective of ensuring that the Subcontractors’
Cost element of our Main Contract Prolongation Cost claim(s) shall comprise solely of time related costs
that are fully supported with evidence that a cost has been or will be incurred. In this regard we have
prepared the enclosed General Comments and Specific Comments so that you may recognise the
deficiencies in your submission, which we hereby direct you (pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.9 of the
Conditions of Subcontract) to rectify.
Please note that this letter, the General Comments and Specific Comments concern the quantum (i.e.
cost) element of our Main Contract Prolongation Cost claim(s) relating to the extension of the Main
Contract Time for Completion that we claim was caused by events which under the Main Contract are at
the risk and responsibility of the Employer. Any stand-alone claim that you may elect to make under
your Subcontract should however also take cognisance of the enclosed comments and include all
supporting documents required in accordance with the Conditions of Subcontract, including but not
limited to:

(i)
a copy of the timely notices (Sub-Clause 27.1.1 and 27.1.3);
(ii)
contemporary records (Sub-Clause 27.1.4);
(iii)
the fully detailed claim with full supporting particulars (Sub-Clause 27.1.5); and
(iv)
a Time Impact Analysis “using a methodology acceptable to the Contractor [and] demonstrating
the effect and consequences of the events and periods of delay relied upon by the Subcontractor in its
claim” (Sub-Clause 27.2.1).
Suffice to say that your prompt and complete cooperation in this matter is to our mutual benefit and
that any extension of the Subcontract Time for Completion and additional payment to you of any
compensable delay shall be subject to you always having complied fully with all of your related
obligations under the Subcontract.
To the extent that any aspect of this letter and/or the enclosures (General Comments and Specific
Comments) is unclear to you, we would be pleased to meet with you and discuss your queries.
Yours faithfully,
