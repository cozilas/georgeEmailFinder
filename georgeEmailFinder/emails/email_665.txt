Dear Sir,

Missing Data Outlets for Cameras Added in Bulletin 245.2

The Contractor refers to the Engineer’s letter referenced in (1) above replying to the Contractor’s RFEI
referenced in (2), considering the Engineer’s consideration, the Contractor responds as follows.
We are not in agreement with your statement, “We now consider this matter closed”. We reiterate our
position referenced in (2) and requests the Engineer to issue the required instruction imminently to
proceed with the works.
Reference to letter (3) cannot be considered as closing the matter, as this was only received through
Engineer’s letter reference (1) dated 20 September 2018 responding to our RFEI dated 20 January 2018.
This procedure is not in accordance with the Contract, Specification Section 01 33 00, and Item 1.3A.3
where the processing time and review period of submittals is twenty one (21) calendar days. It has taken
the Engineer 243 days to respond.
Further to the above, you are informed that we are not responsible for the design, sketches or drawings
to develop the design and merely referring to Sub-Consultants late responses purportedly resolving the
issues cannot be accepted.
Since this clarification was received post 04 September 2018, the Amendment Effective Date of the
Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 08, the Engineer is requested to formally instruct us
pursuant to Sub-clause 20.1.1(b) of the CoC and Sub-Clause 2.29, 2.30 and 2.31 (Variations) of SAA8 to
proceed accordingly.

Yours faithfully,
