Subject: Cash Flow support
Dear Sirs
We refer to the above subject and to our recent conversations in respect of both our cash flow support
to major subcontractors and our position that we have entitlement to an increase of the Contract Price
in order to take account of the additional variations instructed during the SAA8 negotiation period, and
for the subsidence works.
We have recently submitted an amended draft supplemental agreement that covers the entitlement
issues. And as you are aware, we are still under significant pressure to continue funding a number of
the major subcontractors to ensure completion of the project.
It is accepted as inevitable and understandable that negotiations over the supplemental agreement
will take some time to conclude and in any case we require cash-flow support in excess of this
entitlement. We therefore request your indulgence in reverting to the basis of your kind offer set out
in draft SAA9: we have made a number of amendments to your draft to align more closely with the
current situation and trust that you will find the principles we have adopted to be acceptable.
We have attached both a 'tracked changes' and a 'clean' version of our amendments and look
forward to discussing these with you and to a swift resolution of our current cash constraint.

Yours faithfully,
