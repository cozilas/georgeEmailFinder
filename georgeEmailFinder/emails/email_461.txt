Subject: Remedial works to subsided services
Dear Sirs,
We refer to your letter noted above and remind you that The Parties agreed that in order to progress
the extensive trialling and iterative testing carried out to date which commenced over six months ago,
we would respond to your instructions as confirmed in writing in order to maintain proper records of
your requirements: this has been done.
It is regrettable that you continue to correspond as if you are not aware of this nor of the circumstances
under which SAA8 was executed, viz. that the Parties agreed to enter into a supplemental agreement
that inter alia removes Clause 5 in its entirety and replaces it with wording that properly reflects the
responsibilities for the failure of the the storm-water and foul sewer systems. In this context your

reference to Clause 9 of SAA8 is inappropriate and your letter is refuted in its entirety.
Once again we find we must record our extreme concern at the time taken for your consultants to find
an appropriate design solution to this failure. We have suggested several alternative methodologies
and respectfully suggest that urgent consideration is given to concluding your design process so that
the revised IFC documents can be issued and remediation works commenced without further delay.
Yours faithfully,
