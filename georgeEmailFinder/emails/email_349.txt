Dear Sir,
With reference to above subject and despite multiple site visits and several email communication
exchanged between us, regarding the F&B Retail downstands progress, you are informed that the works
have failed to progress and the situation has become harmful to the Contractor’s obligations under the
Contract.
Pursuant to Sub Contract Clause 22.1 [Notice to Correct], states that "If the Subcontractor fails to carry
out any obligation under the Subcontract, the Contractor may by notice require the Subcontractor to
make good the failure and to remedy it within a specified reasonable period."
For the purpose of preventing any further unnecessary delays we hereby instruct you pursuant to Clause
11.3 [Instructions of the Contractor] to proceed with the works immediately and complete the
aforementioned works by the date stated below:
28 February 2018
We hereby inform you that if action is not taken and the works are not completed as stated above, you
will be in breach of the Subcontract provisions in accordance with but not limited to Clause 8
[Subcontractor’s Obligations] due to the delay of abovementioned works. We put on record the effects
that may arise out of potentially multiple breaches of the Subcontract provisions as per Clause 22.2.2
(c), (d), (f), (g) & (i) [Termination by Contractor for Subcontractor Default] in an effort to resolve the
issues regarding the completion of F&B Retail Downstands. You are further informed that we will no
longer tolerate your conduct in respect of this matter which may cause delays to the Subcontract Works
for which you shall be held solely responsible.
Pursuant to Clause 22.2.2 (b) [Termination by Contractor for Subcontractor Default] you are reminded
that “The Contractor may, upon giving the Subcontractor seven (7) Days’ notice, terminate the
Subcontract if the Subcontractor fails to comply with a notice under clause 22.1 (Notice to Correct);.”
Notwithstanding the above, you had been instructed multiple times to proceed with the completion of
the aforementioned works but verbally stated non-compliance with the instruction until the issue of a
Variation Order as per Clause 20 [Variations and Adjustments].

In the event whereby the aforementioned statement proves to be truthful, and the construction
activities are indeed delayed pending the issue of an instruction as mentioned above, then you will be
held fully responsible for breach of contract.
Consequently, you will be held fully responsible for the consequences arising out of such potential
breaches and the associated knock-on effects to the Contractor’s ability to administer its works under
the Contract with the Employer. Accordingly, pursuant to Clause 16.4.1 (a), (b), (c) [Recovery of Delays]
your immediate response is requested with explicit clarity on:
1.
Providing a response including specific dates of completion;
2.
Providing all necessary evidence that all required resources are in place to mitigate these ongoing delays;
3.
Proceed with the works in due diligence to ensure earliest completion.
In addition, should you continue to refuse to carry out the work on site, we will have no choice but to
issue a warning for Termination as per Clause 22.2 and request another Subcontractor to execute these
Works and you will be backcharged for the additional costs incurred in accordance with Clauses 10.3
[Contractor’s Claims], 16.6.1 [Delay Damages] and other relevant Clauses.
Finally, we reiterate that this notice to correct is being issued in accordance with Clause 22.1 [Notice to
Correct] of the Subcontract and requires your response within seven (7) days of receipt of this letter.
This is for your information, record and further urgent action.

Yours faithfully,
