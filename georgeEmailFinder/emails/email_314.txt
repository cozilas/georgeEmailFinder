Subject Contractor's Overall Completion Schedule
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to the Contractor's presentation for the Principals' Meeting dated 25
September 2019 and received via email on 24 September 2019 (Attachment 1), wherein the

Contractor has reported MS9B's Completion Date to be forecasted as 28 August 2020. We highlight
that this is a further delay that is attributed to the Contractor and is not acceptable.
The Programme of Works has been modified over the last 2 months across all remaining activities and
in particular for Milestones MS9B and MS9C and as illustrated in the charts below.
The above evidences the Contractor's inability to provide a realistic and accurate Programme of
Works, and this is illustrated by Milestone MS9B being delayed for more than 3 months in less than a 2
weeks reporting period.
Despite the Contractor's commitment at various meetings, including both the Principals' Meeting and
the Risk Committee Meetings, to resubmit the Programme addressing the Engineer's comments
conveyed in (1), the Contractor has failed to meet this commitment. The dates being reflected do not
provide any breakdown or substantiation, and the Engineer is still unable to review the submission.
Both the Employer and the Engineer are unable to rely upon the Contractor's updated Programme of
Works or any forecasts for any planning or communication to the Project's Stakeholders. This is a
breach of the Contractor's obligations under the Contract as this in turn is placing the Project at risk
and is severly impacting the Employer's Airport Operation Plan .
Pursuant to Clause 16.3.3 of the Conditions of Contract, the Contractor is urgently requested to
submit a revised Programme complying with the requirements set out in Clause 16.3.1 and by no later
than 7 days from the date of receipt of this letter.
We hereby reserve the Employer's rights pursuant to Clause 10.3 for any delays and/or costs incurred
as a result of the Contractor's delays, non-compliance and breaches.
Yours faithfully,
