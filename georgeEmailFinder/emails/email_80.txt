Subject:Subsidence Rectification – Grouting – Expiration of Ultra Fine Cement
Dear Sirs,
We refer to your e-mail dated 29 April 2020 (ref: 1), and attach hereto an ‘Ultra Fine Cement Tracking
Log (Expiry Dates) (Update Date: 26.04.20)’, which serves to provide you an update of the status of the
Ultra Fine Cement available on site, in terms of defining: the total quantity available; the dates when the
material was delivered; and the dates when the material will expire and corresponding quantities.
Please note that as result of the UAE Governmental Authorities’ edicts associated with the Coronavirus
(COVID-19) pandemic, including without limitation, the traffic restrictions and other matters previously
notified by way of letters ref (2) and (3), and the impact this has had on the grouting works, combined
with the failure on your part and the part of the Consultants to issue necessary instructions defining the
scope of grouting works, the Ultra Fine Cement will expire before the full quantity can be utilised.
We therefore notify you that we will not be held responsible or liable for such events and circumstances
and accordingly reserve our right to recover the direct costs associated with procuring additional Ultra
Fine Cement to supplement the quantities of material that will invariably expire, as well as reserve our
right to recover any associated delays and the costs of such delays; either under the Contract or at law.
Yours faithfully,
