Likely Delay Notice No. 2727
Airport Operational Systems Furniture Installation at Level L1.0

Dear Sir,
The Contractor hereby submits this Likely Delay Notice No. 2727 accordance with Clause 16.3.5 of the
Conditions of Contract, in consideration that the outstanding furniture design [to the Airport
Operational Systems Workstations] has the potential to adversely affect or delay the execution of the
Works.
1.0
Basis of Notice
Background
RFI/0401/9757
1.1
On 10 September 2015, the Contractor raised Request for Information (RFI) RFI/0401/9757
(dated 7 September 2015) titled, ‘BRS [Baggage Reconciliation System] Workstation furniture layout and
power socket provision confirmation’ together with marked up copies of Special Airport Systems and
Electrical Issued for Construction (IFC) Drawings, advising the Engineer of the following:
1.1.1 In the absence of furniture layout at BRS workstation locations, the Contractor requested the
provision of BRS workstation fixation details; and
1.1.2 The Contractor also noted that dedicated power sockets for the BRS workstation (CPU, Monitor,
etc.) are not shown in Small Power IFC Drawings for BRS workstation, and therefore requested provision
of updated Small Power IFC drawings for BRS workstations.
1.2
The attachments to RFI/0401/9757 consisting of the following:
1.2.1 1 no. x Room references spreadsheet (Figure 1.1 below refers).
Figure 1.1 – Workstation Details for BRS
1.2.2 3 nos. x Special Airport Systems IFC Drawings for ‘Terminal Building Special Airport Equipment’
located at Level L1.0 of Sectors 5.12, 5.18 and 5.23; and
1.2.3 1 no. x Electrical IFC Drawing for ‘Electrical Small Power Plan located at Level L1.0 (Apron Level)
of Sector 5.12’.
1.2.3.1 The Contractor concluded by advising that it is [currently] following data locations as per IFC
Drawings in the absence of furniture layout(s).

1.3
Despite the Contractor requesting a response to RFI/0401/9757 within 9 calendar days (by 19
September 2015), the Engineer / Employer’s Design Consultant failed respond for a further 36 calendar
days i.e. on 25 October 2015, which the Contractor considers is unreasonable.
1.4
Nevertheless, attached to the response were 3 sketches [dated 29 September 2015] as follows:
1.4.1 ‘ESK-1990: MTC-E-09-TB-L1.0-5.12-001 Additional small power outlets for BRS’;
1.4.2 ‘ESK-1990: MTC-E-09-TB-L1.0-5.18-001 Additional small power outlets for BRS’; and
1.4.3 ‘ESK-1990: MTC-E-09-TB-L1.0-5.23-001 Additional small power outlets for BRS’.
1.5
Notwithstanding the late response, the Employer’s Design Consultant advised the Contractor
that:
1.5.1 In respect of the first query [paragraph 1.1.1], the Employer to advise; and
1.5.2 In respect of the second query [paragraph 1.1.2], the Employer’s Design Consultant asked that
the Contractor follow the three sketches identified at paragraph 1.4.1 to 1.4.3.
1.6
While the Employer’s response stated that: “Small power for BRS to be located adjacent to Staff
FIDS where they co-exist. IN other locations BRS power will come from standard office provision”.
RFI/0401/11313
1.7
Thereafter, on 30 March 2016, the Contractor raised RFI/0401/11313 (dated 27 March 2016)
entitled, ‘RFI for AODB, RMS, IB Furniture layout confirmation’, and with reference to the attached
spreadsheets, requested the Engineer to provide furniture locations and furniture details for AODB, RMS
and IB which are missing from the ‘entire’ furniture layout IFC Drawings.
1.7.1 The Contractor further noted that in the absence of furniture location drawing(s), the
Contractor is following Small Power and Data locations as per respective IFC drawings.
1.8
The attached spreadsheets are reproduced in Figure 1.2, Figure 1.3 and Figure 1.4 below:
Figure 1.2 – Workstation Details for RMS
Figure 1.3 – Workstation Details for AODB
Figure 1.4 – Workstation Details for IB
1.9
The Contractor requested a response to RFI/0401/11313 within 12 calendar days (by 11 April
2016). However, the Engineer / Employer’s Design Consultant failed to provide a response for a further
2 calendar days i.e. on 13 April 2016.
1.10 Nevertheless, in the response to RFI/0401/11313, the Engineer / Employer’s Design Consultant
advised the Contractor “to proceed with IFC [and that] The FF&E layouts use the IFC positioning of
power and data. Furniture layout is a third party scope and will be provided in the future.”
1.10.1 The Engineer offered no further insight on when the furniture layouts would be provided.
RFI/0401/12523
1.11 Meanwhile, on 18 October 2016, the Contractor raised RFI/0401/12523 (dated 11 October
2016) entitled, ‘Check in EY First Class CUPPS and FIDS’, together with two marked up IFC Drawings.
1.12 The Contractor referred the Engineer to Special Airport Systems IFC Drawing No. MTC-SS-02TB_L2.0-5.22-03.006 Rev. 3 wherein Type 4 FIDS and C1 CUPPS are identified. However, FF&E IFC
Drawing No. MTC-Q-02-TB_L2.0-5.52-00.013 Rev. 6 does not show Type 4 and C1 locations as per the
SAS IFC. Therefore, the Contractor requested the Engineer to resolve such ambiguity and to “provide
the missing details, including Type 4 FIDS and CUPPS C1 located in EY First Class.”
1.13 Despite the Contractor requesting the response to RFI/0401/12523 within 16 calendar days (by
3 November 2016), the Engineer / Employer’s Design Consultant failed to respond for a further 73
calendar days i.e. on 15 January 2017, which the Contractor considers is unreasonable.

1.14 Notwithstanding the excessively late response, the Employer’s Design Consultant simply advised
that it awaits the Employer’s feedback and that the Engineer will forward the RFI to the Employer.
1.15 While the Employer responded in the manner reproduced as follows::
“Cabling and infrastructure is to be provided as per IFC, in the locations identified on KPF drawings.
Coordination will be required with the Lounge Fit-Out Contractor once appointed for the final fixing of
equipment, in the meantime all relevant equipment and materials are to be kept in stock until such time
as they are needed for installation.”
1.15.1 Clearly the Engineer failed to properly address the Contractor’s original query but simply
inferred that the noted equipment and materials would be provided later once needed.
SITA letter ref: MTB-SITA-TCAJV-AOS-L-0644
1.16 Sometime later however, on 23 December 2017 (letter dated 21 December 2017, ref: MTB-SITATCAJV-AOS-L-0644) (ref: 4), the Airport Operational Systems (AOS) package subcontractor (SITA) wrote
in connection with the Engineer’s previous ‘responses’ to RFI/0401/11313 received on 13 April 2016]
[paragraph 1.9] and RFI/0401/12523 received on 15 January 2017 [paragraph 1.13].
1.16.1 SITA noted that the response to RFI/0401/11313 advised that the furniture type for AODB, RMS,
IB Systems, CUSS Workstation, FIDS Workstation and BRS Administration Workstations located in Level
L1.0 ‘will be provided by a 3rd (third) party in the future’. However, as the site is ‘maturing’, “and as per
the schedule” SITA advised that it requires the furniture design to finalise the approval of typical
installation drawings.
1.16.2 SITA also advised that the “Same [information requirements] is requested in ... RFI-12523 for
Check-In EY First Class CUPPS and FIDS Furniture's / Signage's.:
1.17 Hence, SITA requested the Engineer to “kindly provide the [furniture] design and advise to
whom we need to coordinate [with] so that we can ensure the cable routing and site readiness.”
1.18 SITA concluded its letter (ref: 4) by advising the Contractor that in accordance with Schedule
10.4, the installation is planned to start on 17 April 2018 and “any delays in the furniture availability is
likely to impact the critical path of the schedule and will delay the completion of the project. “
1.18.1 SITA concluded by reserving its right to claim for extension of time and cost for the delays.
1.19 The Contractor records that the ongoing failure of the Engineer and / or the Employer’s Design
Consultant in providing the furniture design as identified by the foregoing events is continuing to
prevent the Contractor from coordinating and finalising the approval of typical installation drawing(s),
which if allowed to continue absent any action on the Engineer’s / Employer’s Design Consultant’s part,
is likely to impact cable routing works, furniture installation and site readiness.
1.20 It is because of these matters and the potential additional time and financial implications arising
therefrom that has compelled the Contractor to issue this Likely Delay Notice No. 2727.
2.0
Potential Impact to the Works
2.1
This Likely Delay Notice No. 2727 is issued in accordance with Clause 16.3.5 which states:
“The Contractor shall promptly give notice to the Engineer of specific probable future events or
circumstances which may adversely affect or delay the design and/or execution of the Works.”
2.2
At this stage, it is not known whether or to what extent the impacts are, but the approval of
typical installation drawings will be delayed as well as cable routing works, furniture installation and Site
readiness, and are likely to affect or delay the execution of the Works.
2.3
Nevertheless, the Contractor undertakes to assess the impact that this potential delaying event
may have on the Works against the Clause 16.3 Programme (Rev. 6.2), the outcome of which will be
submitted to the Engineer in due course.
Yours faithfully,
