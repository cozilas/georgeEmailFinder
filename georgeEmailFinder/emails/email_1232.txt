Subject: Sewer pipeline and manholes settlement - claim under Construction All Risk Insurance Policy
Dear Sir,

As you will be aware, there is a major concern on Site due to the settlement of several sewer pipelines
and
manholes. The Contractor is currently undergoing the investigatory process in order to determine the
root
cause of the settlement.
As required in Clause 2 of Part 5 of Schedule 14, the Contractor informs the Employer that the
settlement
of the sewer pipeline and manholes is an event that may give rise to a claim under the Construction All
Risks (CAR) Insurance policy that has been provided for by the Employer.
The Contractor hereby requests that the Employer notifies the CAR Insurance policy provider in relation
to
this possible claim.
The Contractor further requests the Employer to respond to this letter, within 7 days of receipt,
confirming that the Employer has notified the CAR insurance policy provider in this regard.
Yours faithfully,
