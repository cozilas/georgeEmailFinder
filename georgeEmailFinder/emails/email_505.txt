Dear Sir,
In response to Mosart’s letter reference (1 and 2) above, we acknowledge receipt of the additional
information provided within each letter in response to TCA JV’s clarifications asked during the recent
dispute workshops held at TCA JV site offices.
In consideration of this additional information, we would like to confirm that we have started our
assessment of the additional records and will be in contact if we require any further clarifications.
Yours faithfully,
