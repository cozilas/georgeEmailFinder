Dear Sir,

The Contractor writes with respect to the National Day Branding requirements undertaken pursuant to
Qatar Rail’s instruction of attachment 3) dated 8 December 2016.

Pursuant to Annex 9 of Volume 2 of the Contract [General Preliminaries] the Employer may “elect to
celebrate the completion of the work under the Contract, or a particular stage in the Works with an
appropriate ceremony and / or may require, from time to time, to undertake promotional activities. If
so, the Contractor will be instructed to make arrangements accordingly”.

Provided the nature of this particular Provisional Sum expenditure the Contractor speculates that no
Tender Plan submission is required against such type of “promotional activities” and has therefore
appended herewith all necessary particulars for the Engineer’s Assistant review, and, for subsequent
payment pursuant to Clause 13.7.4 of Volume 3 of the Contract.

Attachment 1: Purchase Order for the entire requirement;
Attachment 2: Market research, comparative statements and associated supplier quotations;
Attachment 3: Qatar Rail’s Instruction;

As a way forward therefore, and without prejudice to future Tender Plans, the Contractor proposes the
following milestone for this Provisional Sum expenditure.
