Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer’s Instruction Nr.84 of reference 1) issued pursuant to General Condition (“GC”)
13.1.1 of Volume 3 of the Contract, the Contractor encloses herewith full particulars of its actual design
costs related to the provision of the implementation of a Centralized Cooling System.

As a direct consequence of this instruction to vary the works, the Contractor instructed Atkins to
perform additional work and has received a notice for additional payment by Atkins on account of the
additional design works entailed. Those can be summarized as per the following table:

FCN 073

Amount claimed by Atkins

(QAR) ALYSJ JV Determination
(QAR) Amount paid to date
(QAR)
Atkins Lead Design

7,587,053.00

4,356,257.93

3,267,193.45

Atkins MEP Design

6,921,689.00

3,811,363.89

1,905,682.02

Atkins Total

14,508,742.00 8,167,621.82

5,172,875.47

Table 1) FCN 073: Amounts claimed by Atkins, ALYSJ JV Determination for the same and payments to
date

As detailed herein, the Contractor estimates that QAR 8,167,621.82 is a fair and reasonable
compensation to Atkins against the originally claimed value of QAR 14,508,742 which was, at the
Contractor’s opinion, overstated both in terms of the applicable staff rates and the respective time
spent.

The Contractor has enclosed as attachment 1) to this letter its determination of FCN 073.

Whilst noting that none of its aforementioned determination amounts have been agreed with Atkins as
full and sole compensation with the entire balance being the subject of an ongoing dispute, the
Contractor has nevertheless paid the amount of QAR 5,172,875.47 already, for which, proof of payment
in the form of electronic payment (wire transfer) documents has been enclosed as attachment 2)
herewith.

In any event, and whilst noting that the FCN 73 determination amount may be subject to further change,
the Contractor kindly requests the Employer to proceed with an interim, on-account payment of its
current determination value plus 12% for profits and overheads, in the net amount of QAR
9,147,736.44.

Such payment would be of invaluable assistance to the continued financing of the Project.

Yours faithfully,
