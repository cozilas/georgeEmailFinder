Subject Commissioning Organization Chart and Personnel
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to co rrespondence (1) and to the meeting that was held on 16 December
2019 between the Contractor, CxA, the Engineer and the Employer and provide below a summary of
the issues discussed:

1. The Contractor has not evidenced that the integration of the CML team within the
Contractor's team will deliver the best value for their efforts.
2. The Commissioning Agent (CxA) believes that the most effective delivery would be to
integrate the CML team into the Sub-Contractors' delivery structure - maintaining the CSI
team as the TCAJV's level management and QA/QC function to allow monitoring and reporting
as currently applied.
3. The KPis being used to monitor progress and provided by CML and CSI are not clear and a
measurement criteria should be provided along with the Organization Chart.
4. We recognize that the integration of the two Commissioning Management Organizations (CML
and CSI) is a complex task and believe that the Project would be best served by maintaining
discrete responsibilities and measurement KPis for each organization.
5. The Contractor's proposed segregation of CML for the electrical delivery is potentially
a reasonable "second choice", but clear details of delivery targets needs to be provided.
6. The mechanical team structure shows a high level split of responsibility and further details on
how this would work with regard to responsibility for the delivery of set targets needs to be
provided.
7. The CML management resource identified for the BMS management does not evidence having
the appropriate level of expertise/experience for the delivery of the BMS (being primarily a
Mechanical Commissioning Manager)- please provide details of his experience in delivering a
BMS system of this scale to justify his appointment in this role.
Based on the above, the Contractor is requested to review the above comments and advise on their
proposed action within 7 days upon receipt of this let te r.
Yours faithfully,
