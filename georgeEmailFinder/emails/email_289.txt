Subject:Clause 27.1.1: Notice of Claim – Delay Notice No. 0098 – Update No. 2
Delays to the Time for Completion of the Works due to Delays to Receipt of Subsidence
Works Instructions and Subsidence to Other Areas of the MTB
Dear Sir
We refer to our initial Delay Notice No. 0098 issued by way of letter ref: (1), our letter ref: (2) and our
Update [No. 1 to Delay Notice No. 0098] issued by way of letter ref: (3) and write as follows:
With reference to the numerous subsidence related Engineer’s Instructions (EI) issued by you to date
reflected in the schedule attached at Annex A, and in consideration of the delayed, protracted and
piecemeal manner in which the design of the soil rectification works is being issued to us, then the
effects of delay arising therefrom will invariably continue to impact upon the Time for Completion.
The information recorded in Annex A shows that so far you have been responsible in issuing a total of
twenty-one (21) separate EIs over a period of four months. These consist of eight (8) ‘core’ EIs (i.e. EI
Nos. 773, 774, 775, 776, 778, 779, 780 and 781). For example, while EI No. 773 was issued on 12 June
2019, EI No. 781 was not issued until circa two months later i.e. on 15 August 2019. However, we
further record that each of these eight (8) core EIs have been revised at least once (i.e. EI Nos. 773A,
774A, 775A, 776A, 778A, 779A, 780A and 781A). However, two EIs have been revised twice (i.e. EI Nos.
774B and 775B), while one EI has been revised three times (i.e. 773C). Furthermore, the most recent
revisions for EI No. 775, 776, 780, and 781 have only just been released i.e. mid-October 2019.
Therefore, not only has the design been issued in a piecemeal fashion over a prolonged period of time
but the design has been revised on a number of occasions. Accordingly we comment as follows:
1.
The late and piecemeal release of the design and subsequent changes to the design of the soil
rectification works has prevented us from carrying out the works in a timely manner.
2.
This has been exacerbated by the fact that the number of grouting points has been subject to
continuous change, specifically the substantial reduction in grouting points (refer to inter alia Slide No.
14 of the Chairman’s Meeting & Walk – 06 November 2019; copy attached).
3.
The fact that the Employer’s Design Consultant (KPF) has continually changed his design and
reduced the number of grouting points gives us concern that KPF does not understand the root cause of
the subsidence. Consequently, this does not give us confidence in his design.
4.
For example, in the first version of his design, KPF showed grouting beneath the earthing pits,
whereas in the latest design these grouting points have been removed. To the extent that these
earthing pits settle, we will have no responsibility for any direct or consequential losses.
In addition to the forgoing, and whilst we are clearly not responsible in any way for either the original
design nor the instructed remediation solutions, we are concerned at the seemingly arbitrary
delineation between areas being remediated and those that are not. It is our contention that the whole
of the site has a similar geological composition and accordingly we hereby absolve ourselves from any
responsibility for any future subsidence that may occur in areas both remediated and un-remediated or
indeed from any subsidence related issues at the boundary between such areas where, for example
differential settlement may occur.
Yours faithfully,
