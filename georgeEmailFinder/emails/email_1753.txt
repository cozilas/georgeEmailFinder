Dear Sir,

The Contractor hereby acknowledges the receipt of the Instruction under Sub-Clause 13.7.1 of the
General Conditions of Contract (Volume 3) for the Self-Perform Execution of Architectural Finishes
Works (reference 2 above).

The Contractor wishes to record its understanding of the following elements of the instruction, on the
basis of which it confirms its acceptance:

1.
The Spare Parts which are identified as a provisional sum in Appendix A of reference 2 are not
yet concluded and hence do not form part of this instruction;

2.
The scope of the mock-up operation and maintenance in Appendix B, item 2.30 refers to a 24
month period which the Contractor understands to conclude with the handover of the Project on the
31st of August 2018.

The Engineer’s Assistant is requested to kindly inform the Contractor in the event that these
interpretations are not correct and something else was intended.

The Contractor hereby requests the Employer to fast-track payment of the 15% Downpayment (QAR
154,392,000) and requests its approval and payment independently of the regular monthly certification
and associated payment period. To that end, the Contractor attaches here an invoice for the sum in
question.

Meanwhile, the Contractor has initiated the process of obtaining a Downpayment bond from the Bank
and shall be submitting it to the Engineer’s Assistant promptly upon receipt.

The Contractor requests the Engineer’s Assistant to look favourably upon this request in order to aid the
Project’s cashflow.

Yours faithfully,
