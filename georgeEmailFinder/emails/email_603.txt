Subject:Re: Incident Report; Damage on the installed Customer Counter at Check-In CD-09-10
Dear Sir,
We are in receipt of your letter referenced (1) above, in which you informed us about the incident as per
the subject matter. After reviewing the evidence submitted with your letter we note that your works as
shown in the photos have not been protected properly. As per your Subcontract obligations, you failed
to take all appropriate actions to protect your works.
Therefore, we refute the content of your letter and remind you of your obligations under Subcontract
Clauses 15.6.2 [Passing of risk and title], 24.2.1 and 24.2.2 [Subcontractor’s Care of the Subcontract

Works] to protect your works until ownership transfers to the Employer upon Taking over Certificate in
accordance with Subcontract Clause 18 [Contractor’s Taking Over].
Yours faithfully,
