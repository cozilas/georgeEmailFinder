Subject Pipework and other infrastructure subsidence: NCR, Uncovering and Testing- Notice
of Claim for Delay, Disruption and Additional cost in accordance with Contract
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence (1) wherein the Contractor submitted a notice of claim for
an alleged delay and disruption as a result of the subsidence.
The Contractor's notification of claim has no merit as Clause 5 of the Settlement Agreement and
Amendment No.8 (SAA8} applies. The Contractor has no entitlement to claim any additional cost or
an extension to the Time for Completion for the performance of all required rectification works.

In light of the above, the Contractor's assertions in correspondence (1) are rejected and the
Contractor is instructed to follow their obligations under SAA8 otherwise they will be held in breach of
their contractual obligations.
We hereby reserve the Employer's rights under Clause 10.3 and Clause 5.3.2 for any delays that may
be incurred to the Time for Completion for Milestones 9B and 9C.
We trust to have clarified this issue.
Yours faithfully,
