Dear Sir,

Further to the above referenced letters, we confirm that the Engineer's Assistant undertook a review of
the status of Contractor's design progress on Tuesday, 1st March 2016.

The Engineer's Assistant perceives that the status of Contractor's design is as follows:

•
Tunnels - The Ground Investigation Works are 80% complete: 5 no. additional boreholes are
currently being undertaken (one of which was completed on 29 Feb 2016). It was agreed during the
review meeting that these site works should be completed.
•

Station ELS Design - DD1 100% complete based on the tender data.

•
Station Structural & Architectural Design - the 60% workshop has not been held, however draft
60% drawings were forwarded to QR/ PMC for information on 13-Jan-16. The latest MDI on Projectwise
(enclosed) shows the drawings completion status as 45% (Structural) and 60% (Architectural) . The JV
stated that the status was now 80% and that the drawings had been received from the Lead Designer
the night before. JV to provide evidence of these drawings within 7 days of the receipt of this letter
otherwise the status of the drawings will be recorded as 60%. The status of the reports and calculations
is 0%.

gineer's Assistant looks forward to your prompt reply and submission of evidential drawings as above.
Yours faithfully,
