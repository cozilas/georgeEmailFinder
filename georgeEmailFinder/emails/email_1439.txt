Dear Sirs,

Further to the Contractor's fully detailed initial interim combined Claim Nr 025 & 026 submission issued
under cover of reference 3, the Contractor hereby provides its January 2016 monthly update of said
Claim in accordance with General Condition ("GC") 20.1.6(b) of Volume 3 of the Contract.

Extension(s) to the Time(s) for Completion:

The Contractor's initial interim Claim submission at reference 3 includes a Time Impact Analysis ("TIA")
within Section 7.3/Appendix B. For reasons clearly stated within the initial interim Claim submission, the
TIA is based upon a number of assumptions and qualifications which are intended to be re-visited by the
Contractor and adjusted and/or actualised (where necessary/possible) within each subsequent monthly
Claim update and a

new TIA prepared accordingly. To this end, the Contractor has now prepared a revised T IA, as at 31
January 2016, which is attached to this letter at Appendix A. This revised TIA is based upon (1) actualized
activities/events since the initial TIA and, (2) upon assumptions and qualifications for the
commencement and/or completion of remaining additional activities caused by the Claim Event. The
revised TIA at Appendix A to this letter consists of a TIA Narrative (explaining (1) the assumptions and
qualifications employed for the preparation of the updated TIA and, (2) the simulation of the
Claim/Delay Event), an Added Activities Fragnet and, Longest Paths for each of the delayed Time(s) for
Completion listed in the below table.

The revised TIA included within Appendix A of this interim Claim monthly update demonstrates that,
based upon (1) the revised inserted Added Activities Fragnet for the Claim Event, (2) the
aforementioned assumptions/qualifications and, (3) the valid Programme adjustments noted within the
TIA's Narrative, the Contractor has currently incurred/will incur the delays identified within the following
summary table to completion of the whole of the Works and to the affected/identified Sections of the
Works :

The Contractor therefore claims that, due to the Claim/Delay Event/Variation, the Contractor is entitled
to extensions to the Time(s) for Completion for the whole of the Works and to the affected Sections of

the Works listed (together with their respective extension of time periods) within the above table . Such
entitlement is pursuant to GC 2.1.5(a), GC 8.4.1(a), GC 8.4.1(b) and GC 8.4.1(c) of Volume 3 of the
Contract and, pursuant to Article 172.1 (good faith) and Article 220 (unjust enrichment) of the Qatar
Civil Code (Law No 22 of 2004).

Additional CostNalue Claimed To Date:

The Contractor also confirms that the following updated costs information in relation to combined Claim
Nr 025 & 026 has been ascertained by the Contractor over the past month. Accordingly, the Contractor
now provides this January 2016 Financial monthly update to combined Claim Nr 025 & 026.

Subcontract Orders Placed:

The Contractor attaches at Appendix B to this letter a non-exhaustive schedule of Subcontract Orders
currently placed to date to erect the Mock-Up Facility. This schedule provides a total cumulative to-date
Subcontract Order value of QAR 3,820.652.00.

Purchase Orders Placed:

The Contractor attaches at Appendix C to this letter a non-exhaustive schedule of Purchase Orders (for
materials, plant, etc.) currently placed to erect the Mock-Up Facility etc. This schedule provides a total
cumulative to-date Purchase Order value of QAR 2. 130.645.00.

Design-Only Costs:

The Contractor has previously identified within the initial interim Claim submission at reference 3 that
the Architectural FOH Finishes Subcontractor (Hyder Consulting Middle East Ltd) has submitted its
claim/fee proposal for the sum of QAR 3,015,731.00 for Architectural Design Services in connection with
the design of the 1:1 mock-ups. This claim/fee proposal is attached within Appendix V of the initia l
Claim submission.

The Contractor has also now been subsequent ly notified by its Design Verification Engineer (Mott
MacDonald Ltd) of the additional value the latter is claiming with respect to verifying the designs of all
Works in connection with the Claim Event/Variation. This currently notified value is QAR 3,768,173.00. A

breakdown of this sum has been requested by the Contractor and will be forwarded to the Engineer's
Assistant within the next Claim 025/026 monthly update following receipt of same.

This provides a total to-date Design-Only cost/value of QAR 3,015,731.00 + QAR 3,768,173.00 = QAR
6,873,904.00.

Mock-Up Construction Costs:

The initial Claim submission at reference 3 includes details of an approximate, predicted 'supply and
construct' cost-plus value of QAR 42,727.961.00 (excluding the supply of the stone materials which are
to be supplied by the Contractor). This figure is based upon the employment of UrbaCon Trading &
Contracting W.L.L. ("UCC") for the construction of the main internal mock-up. Although it is now the
Contractor's intention to self- manage the construction of the main internal mock-up with the aspiration
of possibly reducing such costs, the Contractor still includes the aforementioned figure within this
combined Claim 025 & 026 January update until it is confirmed that such cost reductions are indeed
possible.

Prolongation Costs & Losses (Contractor & Subcontractors):

Contractor's & Subcontractors' Prolongation Costs and Losses:

As summarised within the above table, the revised interim TIA attached to this Claim update currently
demonstrates that, due to the Claim Event, delays have been incurred to the Time(s) for Completion for
the Works Sections listed therein.

The Claim Event/Delay Event has occurred from receipt of Engineer's Instruction ("El") Nr 92 on 19
August 2015. Delays have therefore been incurred from/including 20 August 2015 .

The Contractor has not yet received any Subcontractor prolongation costs information for the
Claim/Delay Event.

In calculating the Contractor's direct prolongation costs for this Claim/Delay Event, the Contractor has
utilised its latest monthly time related costs available at the time of preparing this Claim submission i.e.
the time-related costs up to and including December 2015.

Attached at Appendix D of this Claim submission are spread sheets of the Contractor's time-related costs
incurred for each month within 2015. Spread sheet 'A' provides the Contract Work Section-Spec ific
Time- Related Costs per month within 2015 and spread sheet 'B' provides the Contract-Wide TimeRelated Costs per month within 2015 .These spread sheets are obviously summary sheets due to the
commercially sensitive and personal information involved. The Employer/Engineer/EA are therefore
invited to visit the Contractor's Head Office by prior appointment in order to fully understand and
inspect the costs build-up behind the summary figures included within the aforementioned spread
sheets.

Please further note that the aforementioned time-related costs spread sheets currently exclude
provisional sum time-related costs which will be added/included within further updates of this Claim
submission.

The tables attached at Appendix E to this letter show the Contract Work Section-Specific Time-Related
costs figures extracted from spread sheet 'A' for each of the respective Stations affected by the
Claim/Delay Event to date (31 January 2016) for the relevant months in which delays have been incurred
upon each respective Station's STTO from/including 20 August 2015 (commencement of the Delay
Event). The total Station-Specific Time-Related Costs for the Delay Event for each of those Stations
delayed by the Claim/Delay Event are collected within the following table:

Station Total Station-Specific Time-Related Costs for Station's Delay Period (Appendix E refers) QAR

Al Sudan Station (SAS) 3,727,354.31
Qatar National Museum Station (SHQ) 3,187,637.34
Souq Waqif Station (DSQ)

1,746,157.37

Al Waab Station (WAC) 861,414.98
Al Sadd Station (SAC)
TOTAL 9,489, 144.43

(33,419.57)

From the Contract-Wide Time-Related Costs Spread Sheet 'B,' the total Contract-W ide time-related
costs for each of the months included within the total Delay Event period (running from/including 20
August 2015 to/including 13 December 2015 currently, i.e. 116 days) are included within the below
table. Such costs are termed "Contract-Wide" costs because they are not incurred due to any one
specific Work Section. Accordingly, to the extent that such resources are maintained longer upon the
overall Contract due to a delay incurred to the completion of a Work Section, then such Contract Wide
costs are incurred due to the Delay Event delaying that particular Work Section.

In conclusion, the total Contractor's prolongation costs claimed to date for the Delay Event are as
follows:

QAR 9,489, 144.00 (Station-Specific Time-Related Costs) + QAR 112,154,616.00 (Contract-Wide TimeRelated Costs) = OAR 121.643.760.00.

177,196,922.00

Total Overheads & Profit ("OHP") (before Finance Costs) are therefore calculated as follows:

OAR 177,196,922.00 (Total Additional Cost before Overheads & Profit & Finance) x 13% OHP = OAR
23.035.600.00.

Contractor 's Financing Costs:

No payment for costs included within this Claim has yet been received by the Contractor. Financing
costs have therefore been incurred at the rate of 4.25%.

Finance on Costs Incurred to date (excluding Prolongation Costs):

These costs have been incurred generally over the period from commencement of the Delay Event (20
August 2015) to Claim update date (31 January 2016) - i.e. 165 days - note, Mock-Up construction has
not commenced within this period so these costs have not been included within this current calculation.

OAR 3,820,652.00 (Subcontract Orders Placed) + OAR 2,130,645.00 (Purchase Orders Placed) + OAR
6,873,904.00 (Design-Only cosUvalue) = QAR 12,825,201.00.

OHP on these costs are: OAR 12,825,201.00 x 13% = OAR 1,667,276.00.

Total Finance Costs on these Costs are:

(OAR 12,825,201.00 + OAR 1,667,276.00) x 50% x 165 days/365 days x 4.25% p.a. = OAR 139,217.00.

Finance Costs On Prolongation Costs I ncurred to Date:

These costs have been incurred generally over (1) the period from commencement of the Delay Event
(20 August 2015) to the current "end date" of the Delay Event (13 December 2015) (which is based upon
the aforementioned TIA assumptions and qualifications) - i.e. a period of 116 days and, (2) from the
current "end date" of the Delay Event to this Claim update date (31 January 2016) - i.e. a period of 49
days.

Prolongation Costs are OAR 121,643,760.00.

OHP upon same are: OAR 121,643,760.00 x 13% (OHP) = OAR 15,813,689.00.
Finance costs upon ditto are therefore: Period of Delay Event:
(OAR 121,643,760.00 + OAR 15,813,689.00) x 50% x 116 days/365 days x 4.25% p.a. = OAR 928,309.00.

Period Post Delay Event:
(OAR 121,643,760.00 + OAR 15,813,689.00 + OAR 928,309.00) x 100% x 49 days /365 days x 4.25% p.a. =

OAR 789,557.00.

Total Finance Costs to Date on Prolongation Costs are therefore: OAR 928,309.00 + OAR 789,557.00 =
OAR 1.717.866.00.

Therefore, Total Finance on all Costs to Date (31 January 2016) are:
OAR 139,217.00 (upon General Costs & OHP) + OAR 1,717,866.00 (upon Prolongation Costs & OHP) =
OAR 1,857,083.00.

OHP upon Total Finance Costs to Date: OAR 1,857,083.00 x 13% (OHP) = OAR 241.421.00.

Therefore, Total Finance Costs to Date & OHP upon Same = OAR 1,857,083.00 + OAR 241,421 .00 = OAR
2,098,504.00.

This provides a January 2016 updated Financial Summary for combined Claim 025 & 026 as follows:

As the Claim Event giving rise to this Claim has a continuing effect and the Contractor is still collating
further particulars, the Contractor shall be submitting further interim Claim submissions with respect to
the Claim Event giving rise to combined Claim Nr 025 & 026 at monthly intervals as required by GC 20 .1.
Yours faithfully,
