Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to letter 1) whereby the Engineer's Assistant provided the necessary clarification
with regards to the SAP drawing revision (CP0_14_74061 Rev V6_0 or CP0_14_74061 Rev V7_0) that
encapsulates the final SAP requirements as per the Contractor's request under letter reference 2).

The Contractor hereby acknowledges receipt of the Engineer's Assistant's clarification that "SAP drawing
CP0_ 14_ 74061 Rev V6_ 0 as referenced in Engineer's Instruction No. 86 is replaced with SAP drawing
CP0_ 14_74061 Rev V7 _o that was issued to Contractor under Employer's email transmittal MOOOQRCINFM-010596 dated 01 September 2015."

In this respect, the Contractor notes that the Engineer's Instruction No. 86 is now superseded and kindly
requests the Engineer to issue the necessary revised instruction pursuant to Sub-Clauses 3.1.4, 3.3,
13.1.1 and 13.1.2 of the Contract.

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification. Yours faithfully,
