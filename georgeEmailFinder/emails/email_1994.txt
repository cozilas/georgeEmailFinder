Dear Sir,

The Engineer's Assistant wishes to bring to the attention of Contractor a proposed configuration to
Station Entrance 1.2 at Al Sudan Station. The configuration is as a result of a direction from Higher
Authority to MMUP as a result of plans to build a residential palace in close proximity to the station
entrance.

The Central Planning Office will shortly be demobilised and the SAP baseline (Rev. V-16) will remain the
final revision. Coordination to obtain final approval remains the Contractor's responsibility. Therefore,
the Engineer's Assistant highly recommends the Contractor to prioritize their efforts in obtaining all
necessary Entrance & SAP structure approvals from authorities and stakeholders at the earliest
opportunity. According to our latest information, implementing the following 90 degrees rotation of the
entrance will facilitate obtaining the approvals .
Yours faithfully,
