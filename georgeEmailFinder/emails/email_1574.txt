Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to its letter at reference 1 within which the Contractor requests the Engineer's
Assistant ("EA") to arrange for the issuance to the Contractor of an Engineer's Variation Instruction,
pursuant to General Condition ("GC") 13.1.1 of Volume 3 of the Contract, to formally cover/instruct the
Variation contained within the EA's letter at reference 5, to vary/change the Employer's Requirements in
order to provide a centralised cooling system for Stations and Tunnels within Lot 2.1 and, to make
provisions within the civilstructures within Lots 2.2 and 2.3 to accommodate possible future centralised
cooling. Unfortunately, no such formal Engineer's Variation Instruction has been received by the
Contractor's requested response date of 24 February 2016.

In these circumstances, the Contractor has to therefore now conclude that the EA's aforementioned
instruction contained within reference 5, which has been made with the Employer's full knowledge and
lack of objection to same (as evidenced by the Employer's Project Director's initialing of reference 5
prior to issuance of same to the Contractor), is an Engineer's Instruction issued pursuant to GC 3.3.1
with the Employer's Authority pursuant to GC 3.1.4{b). The Contractor also concludes that this
Engineer's Instruction constitutes a Variation pursuant to GC 13.1.1 given within the Employer's
Authority pursuant to GC 3.1.4(m).

The Contractor is of the opinion that this Engineer's Variation Instruction may provide the Contractor
with entitlement for additional payment for the resulting varied Works as an addition to the Contract
Price pursuant

to GC 13.6.1 and may provide the Contractor with entitlement to receive extension(s) to the affected
Time(s) for Completion pursuant to GC 8.4.1(a) for any delays consequently incurred due to executing
the varied Works.

Accordingly, the Contractor hereby notifies the Engineer's Assistant of the Contractor's intention to
claim for its entitlement (1) for additional payment due to the aforementioned Engineer's Variation
Instruction (notification pursuant to GC 3.3.4 and GC 20.1.2) and, (2) for any extensions to the affected
Time(s) for Completion for any delays that may be incurred due to the aforementioned Engineer's
Variation Instruction (notification pursuant to GC 3.3.4, GC 8.4.2 and GC 20.1.2).

Please rest assured however that notwithstanding the above, the Contractor will endeavour, in
accordance with its contractual obligations , to mitigate any delays and additional costs incurred due to
the alleged Engineer's Instruction.

Yours faithfully,
