Subject:

Overdue Payments and Non-Certification of Works

Dear Sir,
Further to our numerous email and letter correspondences ref: (1 to 4) above, and in particular our
email ref: (4) above, we write regarding the delayed release of recent Payments and Interim Payment
Certificates (IPC) and wish to officially put on record, that at the date of writing, we are yet to receive
the overdue payments from you (ABJV) for Works that were undertaken in June and July 2020, as
discussed in our email ref: (4) above and enclosed to Annex B hereto, and further explained below.
We note that at the date of writing this letter (24 September 2020), the payment for our Interim
Payment Applications (IPA), IPA No 4 and IPA No 5, has been overdue by 55 days and 22 days
respectively, as shown in Table 1 below. It is worth noting that the Payment for IPA No. 3 was
unreasonably overdue by 86 days.
For clarity, Table 1 below sets out more information regarding the last 3 (three) IPAs’, in the following
manner:
(i)
when our last 3 (three) Payment Applications were submitted to you;
(ii)
when the corresponding Payment Certificates & Payment were to have been issued by you;
(iii)
when they were actually issued; and
(iv)
when the corresponding Payments (via Cheque) were made by you.

In addition, it has come to our attention that the cheques for IPC No. 4 & IPC No. 5, have been issued for
signature to the AB JV’s respective signatories, but are yet to be finalized and issued to us for payment.
Accordingly, we urge you to expedite and complete the signing of the cheques so that they can be
issued to us, as soon as possible.
We have already mentioned in our email correspondences ref: (4) above, that this is causing detrimental
cashflow and financial issues to our company and has impacted and is continuing to impact our ability to
progress with the works constructively. Moreover, it is affecting our ability to settle our financial
obligations not only to our suppliers, creditors but most importantly, the wages of our staff and workers.
We reiterate, that we have been supporting and financing the project for the last few months, but our
ability to continue to do so, has already been significantly affected and will continue to be negatively
affected in the event the payments are further delayed. In this regard, it is important to stress the fact
that it is unreasonable for ABJV to expect us to continue financing the project while the payments are
delayed on your part.
Furthermore, via our email ref: (4) we stated that we would start pulling out manpower from the site, as
a measure of minimizing our exposure to further financial risks caused by ABJV's actions. We also noted
in our said email, that the reduction of manpower will continue to be implemented on our part, until
receipt of the full overdue payments. Nevertheless, after receiving assurances from you that all overdue
payments will be released at the soonest, acting on the utmost good faith, we withheld the removal of
manpower.
We also wish to put on record that apart from the delayed Payments discussed above, there is also a
variance of AED 390,512.25 between the IPAs’ submitted by us and the IPCs’ issued by you, regarding
the works executed to date, as indicated in Table 2 below.

As you can see in Table 2 above, there is a cumulative variance of AED 390,512.52 when comparing the
IPAs’ submitted by us with the IPCs’ issued by you. This a result of non-certification on your part, for the
following executed works:

•
Additional works requested by you, associated with the ‘Rebar loading and sorting of rebars’, as
discussed in our letter ref: (1) above;
•
Additional works requested by you, associated with the provision of a Surveyor with equipment,
as discussed in our letter ref: (1) above;
•
Additional works claimed by us associated with the provision of a QA/QC engineer, as discussed
in our letter ref: (1) above;
•
The non-certification of wall starters, as discussed in our letter ref: (2) above.
Please refer to Annex A attached hereto for further explanation and details of the amounts shown in
Table 2 above.
In view of the above, we kindly request you to proceed with the release of our pending payment and
correction of the IPCs’ as explained above.
In view of the foregoing, we shall hold you responsible for any negative consequences which may arise
due to your failure to proceed with our payments on time. In addition, any delays which have occurred
or which may occur as a result of your actions discussed above, shall be your responsibility.
We trust you find the aforementioned self-explanatory and clarifies the matter, and you will carry out
the necessary action as a matter of urgency.
Yours faithfully,
