Dear Sir,

The Engineer's Assistant (EA) refers to your letter at reference 1) above.

EA notes the content of your letter stating that "...the Contractor would like to confirm that there will be
no cost or time savings associated with civil works." but reminds Contractor that the Contractor's Claim
Number 40, referenced 2), claims for additionalcivil design.

In light of the above, EA requires the Contractor to submit a full and finalestimate in the form of
quotation under Sub-Clause 13.2.2,which should include the following:

(a)

a detailed scope of the Variation (including any drawings or technicaldetails);

(b)

a detailed breakdown of the price for which the Contractor would carry out the Variation;

(c)

the effect (if any)of the proposed Variation on the Time for Completion and the programme.

Furthermore, EA reiterates that for proposed variations as well as for varied works the Contractor
should use the contractual mechanism provided by Clause 13 and awaits the Contractor withdrawalof its
Claim
Yours faithfully,
