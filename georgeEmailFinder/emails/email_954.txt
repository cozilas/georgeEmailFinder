Dear Sir,
The Contractor refers to the detailed interim supporting particulars of claim in respect of the delay
claims
identified in ref: 1, and pursuant to Conditions ,of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.5(b), herewith provides
details
of those interim claims that had an on-going effect upon the Time for Completion of the Works in the
period from 1st to 31st March 2018 (refer to Annex A hereto). However, as recorded within inter alia
our
letter ref: (2), it is not currently possible for us to advise for example the accumulated delay claimed. We
will nevertheless undertake to do so as part of the consolidated Time Impact Analysis (TIA) process.
Meanwhile, further interim and I or final details of the delay claims listed in Annex A hereto will be
provided wherever possible in accordance with Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.5(b) and
SubClause

Yours faithfully
