Emergency Lighting â€“ lux level measurement

Dear Sirs,
We refer to our recent discussions regarding physical lux level measurement on site of the emergency
light fittings and the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) request for an undertaking letter in respect of
the performance of the emergency light fittings.
Setting aside the contractually unacceptable attempt by Bulletins to change a fundamental term of the
build-only Main Contract, our letter of 6 October 2015 made it clear that we would procure and install
light fittings strictly in accordance with the revised IFC documentation issued, as to do otherwise would
delay the project programme. Our letter was not responded to and we therefore proceeded on the basis
that our contract responsibilities were unchanged and we would not provide lighting level calculations.
We confirm that we are now carrying out in-situ testing of the lux levels of the emergency lighting to
demonstrate compliance with the IFC documentation. In order to allow ADAC AHJ to sign off our
drawings we have written an undertaking letter to them stating that, should the tested lux levels for
emergency lighting fall below required levels, we will take immediate corrective action. With your
knowledge and agreement that letter has been issued in the best interests of our mutual Client and of
the Project as a whole, as a pragmatic solution to a situation not of our making and without prejudice to
our contractual position: it must be read as such.
If there are instances where emergency lighting lux levels do not comply with regulations and the
installation is found to be not accordance with the IFC documents we will of course rectify such matters
at our cost.

However, should there be any instances where such lux levels do not comply with regulations but the
installation is in accordance with the IFC documents, whilst we will work urgently and

collaboratively with the Engineer to swiftly resolve matters to the satisfaction of the Authority, the
solution must be confirmed in writing by the Engineer and we will treat any such instances as matters
constituting Variations in accordance with inter alia Conditions of Contract sub-clause 11.3.3.
Yours faithfully,
