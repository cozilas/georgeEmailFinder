Dear Sir,
The Client refers to letter reference 1) whereby the Client informed the Consultant that the proposed
durations for the conclus ion of the DD2 design stages are not acceptable since they adversely affect the
Client's procurement and construction programme.

This is to confirm the Client's requirement at the meeting with the Consultant on 20 October 2015 for
the subm ission of a detailed design programme with submission dates which will ensure the timely
completion of the works . This programme must be sufficiently detailed in order to enable a weekly
progress monitoring.

The Consultant is required to submit the design programme to the Client by 26 October 2015. We
remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.
Yours faithfully,
