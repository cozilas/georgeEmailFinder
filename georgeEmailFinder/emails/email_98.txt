Subject:Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic – Further Update
Three TCA JV Labour Buses Refused Entry during the Morning of 8 April 2020
Dear Sirs,
We refer to our previous letters associated with the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic, including but not
necessarily limited to those referenced above, and write to advise you of the following:
During the morning of Wednesday 8 April 2020, three of our labour buses were refused entry to the
Project Site by ADAC Security owing to some of the labour having been detected to have a high fever
and as such the buses were directed back to their respective labour camps. At the time of writing, we
are unaware as to how many persons specifically exhibited a high temperature and how many persons
were on the buses at the time and are potentially at risk; we will nevertheless endeavour to obtain this
information as soon as possible and advise you accordingly. We do know however that as a result of this
incident and others identified to date, we are increasingly prevented from performing our obligations
under the Contract.
We have written to you variously of late informing of you of the concerns we have in relation the
rapidity but which the virus is spreading and the impact that this is having and continues to have on our
labour and our staff, and those of our subcontractors, as well as the Engineer’s staff and your own staff;
and the ramifications on the Project and the UAE generally. This latest incident is further testament as to
why our concerns are entirely justified and will remain until the virus is under control and the situation
improves.
Meanwhile, we will continue to keep you updated as matters develop; but once again, at the risk of
being repetitive, as the Employer, we request guidance from you as to how best manage the current
situation to minimise the risk of exposure to the virus to all working on the Project and indeed the public
as a whole.
Yours faithfully,
