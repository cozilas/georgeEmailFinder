Re: Engineers Instruction No. 755 – Proposal – Etihad Tenant Change

Dear Sir,
We refer to the above-mentioned subject and our letter reference (2), where we have confirmed that a
ROM proposal as per the subject will be provided at the earliest. Nevertheless, we also put on record
that during the joint workshop meeting with the Employer and the Engineer on 18th October 2018, it
was agreed and confirmed that the Engineer will issue revised detailed drawings to enable us to assess
and provide the cost and time proposal.
In view of the above, please be reminded that to date we have not yet received the revised detailed
drawings and we kindly request you to provide the drawings at the earliest.
This is for your kind information and necessary action.

Yours faithfully,
