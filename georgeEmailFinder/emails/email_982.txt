Subject: Delay Notice No. 1036 - Non-Compliance of DL-21 Internal Glass Sliding Doors
Dear Sir
On 24 August 2017, the Contractor received letter ref: MTC-CMA-TCA-0401-LTR-08067, dated 23 August
2017, enclosing Engineer's Instruction No. 681D. This instructed the Contractor pursuant to Conditions
of
Contract Sub-Clause 20.1.1(a), to "implement the additional information in relation to RFI's and other
queries raised for Door Hardware Workshop Results & Implementation for Central Processor Levels
LB2.0, LBl.O, LO.O, LO.l & Ll.O".
Amongst the myriad changes therein, it was observed that Door Types C-Ll0-1371-04 and C-Ll0-1371-05
for the Limo Pick-up Drop Off Zones had been altered to break out doors for egress. The Contractor
noted in numerous workshops thereafter, and an email to the Employer and its Design Consultants on 8
February 2018 (refer to Annex A) that as the Limo Pick-up Drop Off Zones were considered as garage
areas and therefore, a high hazard area, the breakout functionality was not compliant with both IBC and
Life Safety Codes. Based upon which, the Contractor would be unable to undertake the works as
instructed.
In relation thereto, the Contractor records that to date, and despite the concerns raised on multiple
occasions, the design still remains non-compliant.
The Engineer's continued failure to provide a compliant design is continuing to prevent the Contractor
from coordinating and finalising the approval of Shop Drawings, completing the Limo Pick up Area and
completion of Shell and Core Activities. Consequently, this will impact upon the Contractor's ability to
achieve inter alia Milestones MS06, MS09A.7, and Milestones MS09B and MS10. The Contractor
contends
that this constitutes a breach of Contract or an act of prevention on the part of the Employer's
Personnel.
Therefore, in accordance with Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1, the Contractor
hereby notifies the Engineer of its entitlement to claim:
(i) An extension of the Time for Completion of the Works pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c); and
(ii) An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.2 pursuant to Clause 9.10, or, in
the alternative, damages for breach of Contract. Interim and I or final details of the Time impacts and
adjustment to the Contract Price, will be provided in
due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.S(a), (b) and (c).
Yours faithfully,
