Subject: Delay Notice No. Delay Notice No. 998- Glass Screen System - Handrails
Dear Sir
On 29 January 2015, the Contractor issued RFEI/0401/0181 under cover of letter ref:
MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/003857, dated 27 January 2015, in relation to the 'Glass Balustrade System BAL-05'.
Based upon IFC Drawings and RFI/0401/6131 (received on 17 November 2014), the Contractor noted
structural inadequacies in respect of the handrails and therefore requested revised IFC Drawings to
overcome the deficient design.
A response was received from the Engineer on 22 March 2015, under cover of letter ref: MTC-CMA-TCA0401-LTR-03371, dated 18 March 2015. Therein, the inadequacies were accepted and the thickness of
patches on both sides of the glass was increased and the material of the pad between the metal and
glass
was revised. In the covering letter, the Engineer noted that the response constituted a Variation to the
Works for which an Engineer's Instruction would be prepared and issued. This was never received.
However, in the meantime El No. 286A was received on 15 February 2015 under cover of letter ref:
MTCCMATCA-0401-LTR-03158, dated 11 February 2015. This instructed the increase of post sizes to the
internal glazing, in accordance with the 'Performance Requirements' at Part 1.4 of Specification Section
084126, following issues raised in RFI/0401/6660. The Contractor notes that despite subsequent issues,
this infers that the Employer's Design Consultant is responsible for the handrail design and associated
works.
Based on the changes thus far, on 8 June 2015, the Contractor commenced Material Submittals via
MS/0401/A/0736 for 'Fittings for Glass Screen, Glass Balustrade, Glass Lift and Enclosure'. However, due
to unreasonable comments and consequent rejections by the Employer's Design Consultant, these were
not approved until 24 February 2016, under MS/0401/A/0967 Rev. 00.
In the meantime, the Contractor had commenced submission of Calculations AG-CA-TB-A-069 Rev. 0,
under cover of SDS/0401/A/1793 Rev. 0, on 6 October 2015. However, in the Employer's Design
Consultant's initial response on 27 October 2015, a Code 3 'Revise and Resubmit' was provided. The
basis
of which seemed to question the Employer's design set out within the Engineer's response to
RFEI/0401/0181 (letter ref: LTR-03371).
Therefore, SDS/0401/A/1793 Rev. 01 was submitted on 30 May 2016 (incorporating Calculation AG-CATBA069 Rev. 1), following changes made to glazing tables and braces. However, on 9 June 2016, a Code 3
response was again provided. The Employer's Design Consultant advised that changes should be made
to
the connections of the plates under the handrails. However, as this inferred acceptance of a deficient
design, an instruction pursuant to CC-C 20.1.1(a) would be required.
Nevertheless, on 19 July 2016, SDS/0401/1793 Rev. 02 was submitted on 19 July 2016 (incorporating
Calculation AG-CA-TB-A-069 Rev. 2), addressing comments made on the previous submission. In addition

to the Engineer providing a response 50 calendar days late, the Calculation was again returned with a
Code 3 'Revise and Resubmit'. The Employer's Design Consultant advised that the plate under the
handrail
that connects the handrail to the bracket was not working and several changes were proposed.
Furthermore, it was erroneously opined that the design of this connection was the Contractor's
responsibility. However, the Engineer is reminded that that this design is based upon El No. 268A.
Therefore, responsibility of the design cannot now be shifted to the Contractor.
Furthermore, if the Contractor was to undertake the design, it is not entirely clear why the Employer's
Design Consultant would choose to review, comment and code structural calculations when 3'd party
testing of the design would suffice.
Based on the foregoing, 3'd party testing was undertaken which found that the current design was
structurally adequate. The results of the 3'd party test were provided within SDS/0401/A/1793 Rev. 03
(incorporating Calculation AG-CA-TB-A-069 Rev. 3).
However, on 14 September 2017, a Code 3 response was once again received. This introduced further
structural parameters without basis. Consequent on the unreasonable comments and rejection,
numerous
emails were exchanged with the Employer, commencing 11 October 2017, in which the Contractor
sought
a comprehensive list of deliverables that the Employer's Design Consultant was expecting to find in the
handrail tests. The 3'd party testing company would be advised accordingly, in order to mitigate ongoing
delays, caused by the unnecessary reviews and rejections.
This exchange of emails continued until January 2018. Following which, on 15 February 2018, the
Contractor submitted SDS/0401/A/1793 Rev. 4 (incorporating Calculation AG-CA-TB-A-069 Rev. 4),
which
addressed all deliverables and comments raised by the Employer's Design Consultant.
A response has not yet been received.
The Contractor contends that the Engineer's I Employer's Design Consultant's continued unnecessary
reviews and failure to approve Submittals constitutes a breach of Contract or an act of prevention on
the
part of the Employer's Personnel. Therefore, in accordance with Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses
16.5.2
and 27.1.1, the Contractor hereby notifies the Engineer of its entitlement to claim:
(i) An extension of the Time for Completion of the Works pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c); and
(ii) An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.2 pursuant to Clause 9.10, or, in
the alternative, damages for breach of Contract. Interim and I or final details of the Time impacts and
adjustment to the Contract Price, will be provided in
due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.S(a), (b) and (c).
Yours faithfully,
