Subject Testing and Commissioning Request- Arcades Ceiling Opening
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to the enclosed email correspondence (2) to (4) in relation to the
Contractor's requests to have temporary ceiling openings within the Employer's Other Contractor
finished ceiling areas (M/s Clo isall).
Following the meeting held on 8 January 2020 between the Employer, the Engineer and the
Contractor and the Other Contractor (Cio isall) to discuss the Contractor's request for temporary
openings for the ongoing commissioning works, Cloisall advised that the ceiling works have been
completed in the arcade areas and also that there is no sufficient spare ceiling material available on
site {5 panels) to close all the openings requested by the Contractor. Furthermore, it has been advised
by Cloisall that the lead procurement time to deliver the material is approximately 2 months.
Based on the above, the Contractor is requested to provide a layout marking all openings requ ired
(with dimensions) for the commissioning works and the Contractor in accordance with Clause 12.12.4
of the Conditions of Contract shall be liable to the Employer for the claim submitted by Cloisall and we
hereby reserve the Employer;s rights pursuant to Clause 10.3 of the Conditions of Contract for any
cost and/or damage associated with the above.
Yours faithfully,
