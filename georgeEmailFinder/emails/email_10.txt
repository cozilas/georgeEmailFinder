Subject:
Dear Sir,

Notice of Claim: Change of sequence of works for Intermediate and Top Slabs at Shaft A

With reference to the above subject, we write to inform you about the change in the sequence of works
for the suspended slabs at Intermediate and Top Slabs at Shaft A level -28.15mm, which has caused
excusable and compensable delays as described below. For the sake of clarity, we provide the
chronology of events regarding this issue, as follows:
As per your request, we have submitted our quotation ref: ADMC-ARCHO-DMSTN-SW-QTE-0113_R5
dated 16 July 2020, enclosed to Annex A hereto, for the construction of the Intermediate and Top Slabs
at Shaft A and other structures at EL. 51M. Subsequent to which, our quotation was accepted via the
issuance of Variation Order (VO) No. 2, attached to Annex B hereto.
For the avoidance of doubt, we note that the pricing of our quotation was based on drawing ref: DS2331-02-ST-DRD-0076_6 dated 12 May 2020, also attached to Annex A hereto, an extract of which is
provided in Figure 1 below.
Figure 1

As shown in Figure 1 above, there is an isolation joint which would be constructed with filler boards. We
put on record, that the isolation joint is not under our scope of works. It is also noted that during our
discussions prior to the submission of our quotation, it was confirmed by you that the casting of the
south slab would be a one-time cast. In the same manner, the same execution of a one-time cast, would
also have been applied to the north slab.
Accordingly, we have priced our quotation and allowed in our prices resources for the sequence of
works based on our discussions and the drawings as a one-time cast for the south slab, as well as, for
the north slab. In Table 1 below, we have listed the sequence of works for the casting of the south slab,
based on the original programme of works as per our quotation. We note that the same durations apply
to the north slab:
Table 1 – South Slab
Sr. No Description
Duration (working days)
1
Reinforcement of steel rebar for all the Beams (2B15, 2B16, 2B17, 2B8, 2B4,2B2, 2B7 2b14, 2B1
and 2B6) at level -28.15m
8
2
Reinforcement of Slab at level -28.15m
3
Formwork for all the Beams and slabs- 28.15m 8
4
Casting of Beam and Slab -28.15m
1
Total 17*
*the same duration applies for the north slab
Notwithstanding, after the commencement of the abovementioned works, the slabs’ joints for both
slabs (north and south) changed from isolation joint to a construction joint. Essentially, this means that
the one-time casting for each slab which was initially planned to be constructed, would not be possible
to be executed anymore. As a result of this, the casting sequence for the south and north slab had
changed from a one-time cast, to two different castings for each respective slab. For this reason, the
actual sequence of works for the castings has resulted as follows:
Table 2 – Actual Plan for South Slab

Cantilever Beam 2B6 and 2B13 -28.15m 2
Total 39*
*the same duration applies for the north slab
As you can see in Table 1 above, even though originally it was planned to complete the reinforcement,
formwork, and casting of all beams (2B15, 2B16, 2B17, 2B8, 2B4,2B2, 2B7 2b14, 2B1 and 2B6) for each
slab i.e. south or north slabs within 8 days, however, the sequence of works has changed and the works

were completed within 39 days for each slab as shown in Table 2 above. This means that the works for
each slab were delayed by 22 days (39 days – 17 days = 22 days).
We note that 12 out of 22 days are considered Subcontractor’s delays due to the couplers rectification
works, thus the remaining 10 days for each slab are considered Contractor’s delays. Therefore, 20 days
for both slabs (north and south) are the Contractor’s delays and are a result of the change of the casting
sequence as discussed above.
We note that, the prices provided in our Subcontract rates are inclusive for ‘Time’ and ‘Activity’ (Tasks)
related manpower and have not been segregated in different/separate unit rates, such as direct or
indirect (preliminaries) rates/costs.
The allowance included in our rates for the time-related manpower is for the site engineers, safety
officers, site coordinators, supervisors, storekeepers, foremen, logistics officers, etc., and it is in effect,
the manpower required for the duration of the project.
On the other hand, the activity-related manpower is simply the technicians, skilled workers, unskilled
workers, etc. We put on record that, it has been mutually agreed between us, that in the event of a lack
of available work-fronts, due to disruption of works or change in the sequence of works or any other
delays which are not our responsibility, then the activity-related manpower would be used by you for
works elsewhere on the Project. It has also been agreed, that the activity-related manpower, which is
essentially the direct cost would be compensated by you. We confirm that this practice in on-going, and
it has been implemented successfully to date.
However, all of the time-related manpower (indirect cost) such as site engineers, safety officers,
foremen, site coordinators, storekeepers, etc. remain idle for prolonged periods of time due to events
which we are not responsible as mentioned above, resulting in massive losses to our company. As a
result, we now find ourselves having incurred substantial unforeseen costs due to the abovementioned
delays, disruptions, and the prolonged time, in the middle of this deep financial crisis currently ongoing
in the UAE. We note that this expenditure could reasonably have been avoided, had the disruptions,
change in sequences and/or changes in designs, etc. had not incurred.
Therefore, since our activities are prolonged due to the aforesaid events, we kindly request that the
additional cost incurred for the time-related manpower, is also compensated by you.
For this reason, we have prepared the total cost of the time-related manpower (indirect cost) for the 20
days of excusable and compensable delays which is summarized in Table 3 below, and attached in Annex
C hereto. This indirect cost includes the site staff such as foremen, safety officers, site engineers, etc., as
shown in Table 3 below:

Table 3 – Time-related manpower (Indirect Cost)

As shown in Table 3 above, the total daily cost for the Time-related manpower (Indirect Cost) is AED
9,450.00. Consequently, the total prolonged cost incurred for the total duration of the 20 days, is AED
189,000.00 (20 days x AED 9,450.00).

In view of the foregoing, we put on record that the cost of AED 189,000.00 and the 20 days of delays
discussed above are excusable and compensable and shall be claimed by us.
In view of the foregoing, we maintain our rights and entitlements under the provision of the Subcontract
Clause to an extension to the Time for Completion and any associated costs as per Clauses 7.2
[Extension of Time for Completion], 9.1 [Variations of Subcontract Works],11.1 [Notices] and 11.2
[Claims], arising from the events and circumstances described above.
Yours faithfully,
