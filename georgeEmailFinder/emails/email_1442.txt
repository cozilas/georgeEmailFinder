Dear Sir,

Further to Engineer's Assistant's letter at reference at 1, the Contractor confirms that mock-ups of
Materials and Finishes planned for display (e.g. floors, ceilings, walls, FF&E (Finishes, Fixtures and
Equipment) will be provided as required by the Engineer following receipt of the Engineer's Instruction
upon the expenditure of the relevant Architectural Finishes Provisional Sums in accordance with SubClause 13.7.1 of the General Conditions of Contract (Volume 3).

Only at this point and following development of the Architectural Design, will the Contractor be in a
position of deciding upon materials and finishes details that can be incorporated within the Mock-ups
for the Engineer's approval.

Yours faithfully,
