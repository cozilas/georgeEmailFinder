Subject:

ADMC rented materials used by ABJV

Dear Sir,
With reference to the above subject and further to the email correspondences attached to Annex A
hereto, this is to inform you about the unauthorized use of ADMC’s formwork and scaffolding materials
by ABJV without prior agreement between us, to do so.
Specifically, it has recently come to our attention that some of our formwork and scaffolding materials
have gone missing from our storage area. After further investigation, it was found that these materials
were used by ABJV without any permission by us or any prior communication, coordination, and/or
agreement between us. We note that this is not the first time that ADMC’s materials have been shifted
in other parts of the Project, to be used by ABJV without our permission.
We have attached to Annex B hereto, photographic evidence of some of ADMC’s mentioned materials
being used by ABJV.
We put on record that these materials have been rented by ADMC and are for ADMC’s use only. We also
note that we have previously informed you regarding these incidents, requesting you to refrain from
using ADMC’s rented materials without our permission. However, despite our requests for you to avoid
using ADMC’s materials, these incidents continue to occur.
As evident from the photos enclosed in our email dated 14 December 2020 [9:18:24 AM], also attached
to Annex B hereto, it is clear that our materials have been used by ABJV, without our permission.
Consequently, this is to notify you that we will hold you responsible, if any damage is found on the said
materials, or if any materials or specific items of these materials are lost, then the cost for any
rectification shall be borne by ABJV.

In addition, in the event there are any delays on our part in returning the rented materials to the
supplier as a consequence of your actions, then the additional rental cost will be borne by ABJV.
Moreover, if any delays occur to our works at this stage due to the foregoing, will also be your
responsibility.
Therefore, the purpose of this letter is four-fold:
•
To notify you about the reoccurring incidences of ADMC’s materials being used by ABJV without
our permission;
•
To inform you that any rectification cost for damage or loss that may incur due to ABJV’s
unauthorized use of our materials, shall be borne by ABJV;
•
To request you to return the said materials at the earliest and to notify you that any cost for
potential delays in returning the rented materials will be borne by ABJV;
•
To kindly request you to ensure that appropriate steps are being taken on your part, in order to
avoid the reoccurrence of such events in the future.
In summary, we request your urgent action to resolve the matters noted above in order to mitigate
delay and/or disruption to our Works.
We trust you find the aforementioned self-explanatory, and you will carry out the necessary action as a
matter of urgency.
Yours faithfully,
