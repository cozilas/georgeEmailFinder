The description provide for each of the alleged non-conformances listed in Table 1, remains the same
for all seven NRCs, irrespective of the works and disciplines works; and reads as follows (Figure 1 refers):
Figure 1
While we acknowledge our obligations to comply with Clause 12.1 of the Conditions of Contract, for the
reasons explained in our letter ref: (8) replying to your letter ref: MTC-CMA-TCA-0401-LTR-11305 (ref:
9), we refute that we are in any way responsible for the flooding. The prevention matter and breach of
contract on the part of others was made clear in our letter ref: (10); hence the resultant damage is not
of our making. Moreover, considering the works, plant and equipment subject to each of the disciplines
noted in each NCR has been installed in accordance with the requirements of the Contract and signed
off through the WIR process; then they cannot be construed as being defective or not fit for the purpose
for which they are intended. On this basis we categorically reject all seven (7) NCRs referenced above.
Therefore any necessary remedial works arising in consequence of the matters subject to each of the
above noted NCRs will be addressed in the same manner and to the extent possible as per letter ref: (8).
Yours faithfully,
