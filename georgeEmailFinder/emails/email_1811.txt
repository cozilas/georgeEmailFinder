Dear Sir,

As per letter reference 1), the Contractor has provided full particulars of the costs for the Design
Verification Engineer (“DVE”) incurred to date by the Contractor for the Architectural Front of House
and MEP design verification Provisional Sum Works.

Letter reference 1) did not take into account that the Contractor has agreed with the Engineer’s
Assistant in meetings, and subsequently formally expressed vide letter reference 2), a lump sum
compensation for aforementioned works in the net amount of 57,000,000.00, inclusive of a 4% mark-up
for the Contractor.

The Contractor would therefore like to amend the amounts expressed in letter reference 1 as follows:
DVE Costs for Provisional Sum Works

57,000,000.00

29,345,125.68

Table 1: Summary of DVE Costs

The Contractor herewith kindly requests the Employer to proceed with an interim, on-account payment
of its actual costs incurred plus the agreed 4% mark-up, in the net amount of QAR 29,345,125.68, which
consists 51.5 % of the agreed total lump sum compensation as per letter reference 2).

Such payment would be of invaluable assistance to the continued financing of the Project.

Yours faithfully,
