Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to the Engineer's Instruction ("El") Nr 86 Revised received by the Contractor via
reference 3 on 27 December 2015. This El revises El Nr 86 issued under cover of reference 5 which is
already the subject matter of the Contractor's Claim Nr 31 issued under cover of reference 4 and
updated via references 2 (November 2015 Update) and 1 (December 2015 Update).

The Contractor considers that El No 86-Revised, which has also been issued pursuant to General
Condition ("GC") 13.1.1, may cause the Contractor to incur additional costs and potential delay to the
Time(s) for Completion. As the subject matter of El Nr 86-Revised is so closely related to El Nr 86 and
Claim Nr 31, it is the Contractor's intention, unless the Engineer's Assistant ("EA ") otherwise objects by
return (by the date requested below), to include any such additional costs and delays for El Nr 86Revised within the next monthly update of Claim Nr 031.

However, should the EA object by return, this letter shall serve as the Contractor's intention to claim for
its entitlement (1) for any extensions to the Time(s) for Completion for any delays that may be incurred
due to El Nr 86-Revised and, (2) for payment of any additional costs that may be incurred due to El Nr
86-Revised, all in accordance with GC 8.4.2 and GC 20.1.2 of Volume 3 of the Contract.
Please rest assured however that, notwithstanding the above, the Contractor will endeavour to mitigate
any delays and additional costs incurred due to El Nr 86-Revised in accordance with its contractual
obligations.

Yours faithfully,
