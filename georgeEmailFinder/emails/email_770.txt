Subject Colour Staining to Floor Granite
Dear Sir,
This has reference to the issue of the colour staining to the flooring granite that has been the subject of
recent correspondences between the Parties (recent correspondence cross referenced here for
convenience purposes} and we wish to advise you that to date none of the remedial solutions put
forward or trialed at site directly by your subcontractor have proven to be successful and contrary to
statements that the evidenced staining could be removed by application of special cleaning agents.
According to our records, we are not in receipt of details of such special cleaning agents and would
record here that recent efforts exerted from your end to apply such material(s} did not prove successful.
Given the quantum of the granite yet to be installed and the current critical stage of the Project and
tight
programme to complete all tiling works and with the view of eliminating any further time lost being
spent on "trial and errors" to remedy this situation, we enclose a solution that has been identified and
which has been recently used for similar cases and in similar nature of projects and mainly aims to seal
the stone tiles. The enclosed document provides details of the application and manufacturer literature
with reference to Projects where this has been applied. For your reference contact details of the local
source are as follows:

This is being forwarded to you as a guidance and following on from the time being consumed to provide
a clear solution to this issue under your contractual obligation of Clause 19.8 of the Conditions of
Contract.
Please be advised that a meeting will be scheduled to be attended by the Parties to discuss the way
forward with this application as to progress the tiling installation.
Yours faithfully,
