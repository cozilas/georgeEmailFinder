Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer’s Assistant’s letter of reference 1), the Contractor notes that in accordance with
Subclause 14.3.2 of the General Conditions of Contract the requirement to provide evidence of
payments to Subcontractors is restricted to where such information is required for the assessment of a
payment.

The Contractor has therefore duly provided all payment evidence whenever required for the assessment
of a specific pay item. To mention but one example, under reference 5) relevant evidence of payments
to Subcontractors was enclosed to the Contractor’s request for an on-account payment against
additional design costs incurred in relation to Engineer’s Instructions.

Under letter reference 1) the Engineer’s Assistant has not specified against which pay items he considers
the Contractor is to provide evidence of payments to Subcontractors for the Engineer’s assessment of
the Statement. The Contractor is therefore unaware of any noncompliance with Subclause 14.3.2 and
kindly requests further clarification.
Yours faithfully,
