Subject:Backcharge Notification – February 2018
Dear Sir,
We write in regards to the above subject matter and enclose an updated list of backcharges along with
the supporting documents for your review and attention.
Pursuant to the Conditions of Subcontract Agreement Clause 10.3 [Contractor’s Claims], we hereby
confirm our entitlement to deduct such amounts including but not limited to the enclosed, from your
Interim Payments accordingly. The basis of these charges is mainly derived either from your request to
supply materials and services on your behalf or your failure to proceed with your obligations in
connection with your Subcontract Works.
In addition, we shall backcharge any amount that falls under your responsibility in accordance to Clause
12.12.4 [Other Contractors and Other Subcontractors], whereby you are liable to the Contractor for any
claim by the Employer, other Contractors or other Subcontractors for the costs arising out of your failure
to perform your obligations under the Subcontract.
This is for your information and record.
Yours faithfully,
