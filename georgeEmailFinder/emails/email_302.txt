Request for Re-Coding Shop Drawings

Dear Sir,
Please be advised that the Contractor rejects the comments recently received from the Design
Consultant (ARUP) on the shop drawings listed below:

The Contractor notes that these shop drawings have been rejected on a non-reasonable basis. For
instance, ARUP refers the Contractor to the comments returned on the relevant calculations
(DS/0401/11705-00); however, the said calculations are under review since 16 December 2017 and the
Contractor has not yet received any comments.
Further, the comments made by ARUP regarding coordination are not relevant as the towers included in
these shop drawings were an integral part of Briefing Pack No. 59 and the necessary coordination had
already taken place.
Moreover, the previous submission made in respect of Briefing Pack No. 59 (DS/0401/7914-01), which
included both calculations and drawings, is approved since April 2017.
In view of the above, the Engineer is hereby politely requested to change the code status of the above
listed drawings thus enabling the Contractor to proceed with the Works.
Yours faithfully,
