Dear Sir,

With reference to the Contractor's letter, under reference (1) above, in which Contractor presented his
review and comments in relation to Engineer's Instruction for entrance optimization as issued under
reference (2), the Engineer's Assistant has the following comments:

1.

Optimization of Al Sadd station entrance-03 :

Engineer's Assistant suggests that Contractor should consider removing only the elevator and leave the
slab cutout for the elevator and remaining structure unchanged.

2.

Optimization of Sport City station entrance-03, 04 & 05:

Contractor has not considered that there are whole life cost saving accruing to Employer which justifies
his approach to optimization at this location. Contractor is hereby requested to adhere to Employer's
Instruction.

3.
The Engineer's Assistant acknowledges the Contractor's inclusions of entrance optimization
proposals in the design, for National Museum of Qatar station entrance-03 ; Joaan station entrance-01
and deletion of Al Sadd station entrance-04 & its associated subway.

4.

Optimization of Souq Waqif station entrance-03 and Al Sudan station entrance-02 :

Engineer's Assistant confirms the removal of retail at Souq Waqif station subway to Entrance-03.
Contractor had been provided with details of Engineer's preferences for both the entrances along with
relevant information, during a series of workshops and discussions in relation to this matter. The
Contractor is hereby reminded to further develop and present those preferred proposals for Engineer's
Assistants agreement.
Yours faithfully,
