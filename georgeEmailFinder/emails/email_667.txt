Request for Engineer’s Instruction [RFEI/0401/0729]
Requirement to Change the Colour of the Group A Lift Shafts from White to Grey
Dear Sir,
The Contractor refers to the attached email correspondence whereby representatives of the Employer
and the Design Consultant have requested the Contractor to change the colour of the main steel top
coat of the group A lifts from white to grey RAL 9006.
As acknowledged by the Design Consultant in its email on 30 September 2018, the colour approved for
the groupe A steel shafts was white. Therefore, please be notified that changing the coating colour to
grey RAL 9006 as per the Employer’s and Design Consultant’s request will constitute a Variation.
The Contractor requests therefore that the Engineer confirms the coating colour for the group A lift
shafts via an Engineer’s Instruction pursuant to Clause 20.1.1(b) of the Conditions of Contract. Upon
receipt of the Engineer’s Instruction, the Contractor will compile the cost and time impact proposals for
the specified scope and, in compliance with Clauses 2.29, 2.30 and 2.31 of SAA8, will submit these
proposals to the Engineer and the Employer for their agreement prior to proceeding with the additional
works.
For the sake of clarity, this was never concluded before the effective date of 04 September 2018 and is
not subject to Sub-Clause 1.7.2 and 1.7.4 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment Number 8.
Yours faithfully,
