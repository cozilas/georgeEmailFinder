Re: Amended Third Party Agreement (TPA) - International Ship Repair FZE

Dear Sir,
We write with reference to your letter referenced in (3) above and our email enclosed herewith,
regarding the above subject.
We observed that you have amended and increased the TPA amount of your Subcontractor, without our
consent and approval; unfortunately, such amendment cannot be accepted and is hereby rejected. In
this regard, we are kindly returning the original document to you for your records.
Please refrain from amending and increasing any agreed “TPA” amounts in the future without our
approval.
Yours faithfully,
