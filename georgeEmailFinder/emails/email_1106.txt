In respect of Extension of Time No. 1 (EOT-1) for the period from 14 July 2013 to 05 March 2015

a. Please note that the 20 nos. XER file of the 20 nos. window used in the Subcontractor's claim
submission are corrupted and were imported into Primavera P6 with errors. Notwithstanding this,
the Contractor proceeded with its analysis and is currently verifying the as-built information in
these 20 nos. file using the imported data. For the sake of accuracy and in order to expedite the
Contractor's assessment, the Subcontractor's is kindly requested to provide a set of fresh copies
of these XER files.
b. The initial review of these 20 nos. file shows that the analysed programmes are progress updates
done on rev.-05 of the Subcontractor's baseline programme. Please confirm that these monthly
progress updates, together with its monthly reports, have been submitted to the Contractor.
c. The Subcontractor included in attachment 1.2 to EOT-1 a summary table of its window analysis.
The Contractor notes that the completion dates provided in the fifth column of this table do not
match with the completion dates in the 20 nos. XER file provided with its EOT-1 submission.

under attachments 1.3A, 1.3B and 1.3C to its EOT-1 claim. Please provide the XER files of these
delay fragnet programmes.
In relation to Extension of Time No. 2 (EOT-2) for the period from 06 March 2015 to 22 December 2016
submitted via the Subcontractor's letter references (2) and (3):
a. The Contractor notes that the Subcontractor used rev.-05 of its baseline for its application for
EOT-1. Further, the Subcontractor submitted, via its transmittal reference 13040-GPC-PD-HWTCAJVMTB-0282 dated 26 April 2015, an accelerated programme based on the Contractor'sProgramme Rev.6.2; however, rev.-01, rev.-02 and rev.-03 baseline programmes were attached
to the Subcontractor's EOT-2 application. It is not clear which programme revision has been used
by the Subcontractor for analysing the delay events of its EOT-2. Please clarify.
b. The Subcontractor enclosed under Appendix I of its EOT-2 submission an 'as-built programme' as
of 22 December 2016 prepared on rev.-02 of its baseline. This 'as-built programme' was
submitted in pdf format. Please provide the corresponding XER file.
c. The Subcontractor used three windows in its EOT-2 submission, viz:
Window 1-from 14 July 2013 to OS March 2015
Window 2- from 06 March 2015 to 31 December 2015
Window 3- from 01 January 2016 to 22 December 2016
The Subcontractor submitted the relevant delay analysis programmes under Appendices M, Nand
0 of its EOT-2 application. These delay analysis programmes were also submitted in pdf format.
Please provide the corresponding XER files.
d. The Subcontractor included 32 delay events in its EOT-2 submission. Please note that:
For delay event nos. 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 24, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 and 32, only
cost details have been submitted, i.e. no information has been provided thus far to assess
the time entitlement in respect of these delay events.
For delay event nos. 3, 5, 7, 8, 20, 21 and 22, only 'summary programmes' in pdf format
have been submitted. Please note that these 'summary programmes' may not provide
sufficient level of information vis-a-vis the Subcontractor's time entitlements.
For delay event nos. 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 23, 25 and 26, the Subcontractor submitted a
'fragmented programme' of delay fragnets prepared in Primavera P6. This 'fragmented
programme' was submitted in pdf format only. Please provide the corresponding XER file(s)

to enable further review of these delay events.
In summary, the Contractor understands that the Subcontractor used rev.-05 and rev.-02 of its baseline
programme for its EOT-1 and EOT-2 submissions respectively. The Contractor would have expected that
the Subcontractor had used for its EOT-2 submission progress updates on either rev.-05 of its baseline or
the accelerated programme dated April 2015. Please clarify this.
Please be kindly requested to furnish the Contractor with both the above requested clarifications and
additional documents thus enabling it to continue with its assessment of the Subcontractor's
entitlements. Please further note, that this letter is not, of itself, to be considered as an admission of any
entitlement to an extension of time and/or additional payment, nor does it constitute a waiver of any of
the terms of the Subcontract.
Yours faithfully,
