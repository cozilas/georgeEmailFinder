Dear Sir,

With reference to the above letters requesting a quotation for the design & construction of a service
tunnel across Al Waab Street, Engineer's Assistant notes Contractor's failure to respond as of the date of
this letter.

Aspire Zone informed Qatar Rail that they have decided not to wait any further on ALYSJ's quotation and
will
therefore request another Contractor to execute this tunnel.

Based on the above the Engineer's Assistant's letters referenced above are now superseded and can be
considere closed.

Yours faithfully,
