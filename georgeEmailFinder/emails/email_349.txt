Dear sir
We are in receipt of the Engineer responses to the above referenced Submittal wherein 73 nos .. of Shop
Drawings were returned with either Action Code-3 or Code-4by reason of future IFC changes.
There are also another 58 nos. of Shop Drawings currently under review by the Engineer that we
understand are likely to be similarly returned with Engineer's action Code 3 or Code 4 by reasons of

similar design changes to the new structured cabling design of the Government network and Satellite
Communication Rooms (SCR).
We have previously written to the Engineer with regards to delays and disruption caused by the
uncertainty with regards to such contemplated IFC reissuances. Refer to (12) and (13).
Please note that the Engineer's action code 3 will cause delays and abortive works and we deem such
actions by the Engineer as inappropriate in consideration that they are not discharged as a result of
issues
with the form or content of our Submitta~but rather to stop the Works due to pending Variations.
The Engineer is well advised to stay true to the authorities granted under the Contract whereby the
Engineer may legitimately stop such Works by issuing an appropriate Suspension Notice. Recognizing
that the Contractor is not in apposition to anticipate the pending changes and revise the above
reference
Shop Drawings, we deem such action codes as Suspension Notices justifying additional Costs and
extension of Time for Completion pursuant to the Conditions of Contract clause 16.9.
We are unable to progress further with-out the revised IFCs and urgently request the Engineer to
provide
the date on which such Bulletins will be issued by the Engineer.
We give notice pursuant to Conditions of Contract Clause 9.10.3 that the above requested action if not
provided immediately, will delay and/or disrupt the progress of the Works, and potentially increase the
Contract Price.
This is for your kind information and consideration.
Yours faithfully
