Dear Sir,

We refer to the above mentioned Engineer's Instruction No.34 (ref. M006-QRC-EMT-IST- 00011 dated 10
March 2015).

We have reviewed the relaxed Employer's Requirements for Straight Stairs of more than two flights and
confirm that there are potential structural design impacts which is currently being reviewed. A full
report will be submitted in due course detailing the full impacts to the overall design.

We refer to the above mentioned Engineer's Instruction (El) No.34 (ref.M006-QRC-EMT-IST- 00011
dated 10 March 2015) and our earlier letter (ref. M006-ATK-COM-LTR-00487 dated 13th May 2015).

We have further analysed the El and confirm that stairs between Platform and Concourse in current
designs comply with the Instruction, hence there is no impact.

However, we note that the El does not encompass stairs between Concourse to Grade levels and it is our
understanding that they are currently under discussion between the Client and the PMC/QRail. The
outcome of the ongoing discussion, once communicated to the Consultant, will be analysed for impact
on current station designs and reported to the Client.

Based on the above, we believe a report detailing impact as requested in the Client's letter ref. M006GDB-EMT-LTR-00001 dated 4th April 2015 is not required at this stage.
Yours faithfully,
