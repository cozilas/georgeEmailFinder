Re: Central Processor Level 2, Pier 1 Connection – Instruction to Close Metal Ceiling - CVI

Dear Sir,

Subject:
Removal, Relocation and Installation of HVAC Duct and Associated Accessories Due to
Clash with Ceiling at CP, L2.0, Sector-5.24C, 5.24D & 5.30A - Remedial Works
Dear Sir,
We refer to your cost submission of 0401-PCEJV-RFVO-0153 via document transmittal reference MTBPCEJV-TCAJV-G-TN-02662 dated 06 November 2018 with an amount of AED 8,746.13 related to the
abovementioned subject.
Further to our review on your request for a Variation, we would comment as follows:
•
We have at no point issued to you an instruction to proceed with the above mentioned works in
order to resolve the clashing issues of services with the ceiling.
•
This is a coordination issue where clashing issues are due to the MEP services not following the
coordinated BIM model as issued to relevant Subcontractors.
It is abundantly clear that the said elements are caused by your failure to properly coordinate in order to
avoid such occurrences, as per Clauses 12.11 [Cooperation] and 12.12 [Other Contractors and Other
Subcontractors] of the Subcontract Agreement.
Accordingly, in line with the Sub-Clauses 16.5 [Extension of Subcontract Time for Completion], 21.2
[Adjustments to the Subcontract Price] and 11.4 [Determinations] of the Conditions of Subcontract, we
hereby reject this cost submission for any entitlement to an extension of Subcontract Time for
Completion or any adjustment to the Subcontract Price.
We trust the aforementioned is self-explanatory, however, if you seek further clarification, please do
not hesitate to contact the undersigned.
Yours faithfully,
