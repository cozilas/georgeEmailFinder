EoT & Prolongation Cost Assessment

Dear Sir,
We write in response to your letter reference MTB/TCA/MOSART/L/000594 dated gth August 2018.
We note your requirement that we present audited accounts from the head office as evidence of the
overhead costs. We shall provide these in due course and apply these to the Emden Formula. Meantime
we are enclosing 'Statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income' section from our Audited
Financials for the year 2017 for your reference.

We note the comment that the Subcontract Agreement expressly excludes 'profit' for any claim for
'additional Costs', however we note that the Subcontractor as per Sub-Clause 27.1.1 can claim for:
'additional Costs incurred, an adjustment to the Subcontract Price and/or any other costs or damages ...
'
We note that:
1. Profit is defined as per Schedule 1 (Subcontract Particulars) as 'Express as a percentage on cost for
profit at Four Per Cent {4%)', and
2. A party is entitled under UAE Law to recover loss of profit as damages.
Profit is therefore recoverable as 'any other costs' or 'damages' in both Contract and in Law.
We would be pleased to meet in order to provide any further information you might require.
Yours faithfully,
