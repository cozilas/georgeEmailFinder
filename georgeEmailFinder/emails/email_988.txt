Subject: Delay in Submission of As-built Drawings
Dear Sir,
Further to our letter ref. MTB/TCA/MOSART/L/000511 dated 17-Jan-18, regarding as-built drawing
schedule, we regret to note that your as-built drawing submission schedule is yet to be received.
In the absence of your response, with reference to the Target As-built Drawing Schedule Rev 02.1 issued
to yourselves under above mentioned TCAJV letter, please be reminded that the scheduled dates are
overdue.
Moreover, it has been observed that your submission of as-built drawings of Pier 4 & Pier 3 have
currently become critical for the Project Handing Over.
As per the Programme Rev. 10.4 and Project Close-out Forecasting Principle including As-built BIM
Model submission and approval durations, final As-built Drawing submissions may not exceed the
following latest dates for each stage of the building completion:
• Pier 4 -- 03 May 2018,
• Pier 3 -- 21 Jun 2018,
• Pier 1 -- 12 Aug 2018,
• Pier 2 -- 21 Sep 2018,
• CP -- 16 Jan 2019 .
Since the submission and approval of the handing over documentation is mandatory for obtaining the
taking over certificate for each completion stage of the project, you are required to take the following
necessary actions with immediate effect:
a) Provide mitigation plan (revised forecast dates) for all delayed as-built drawings.
b) Provide revised submission plan for all balance as-built drawings in line with planned construction
completion dates.
c) Submit all balance as-built drawings for approval in an expeditious manner.
d) Resubmit any Code 3 or Code 4 as-built drawings if applicable.
Yours faithfully,
