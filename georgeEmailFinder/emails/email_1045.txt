Subject: Engineer's Overdue Response to the Contractor's Request for Confirmation of
Variation Order for RFEI/0401/0592- Wet and Damp Area
Dear Sir,
The Contractor refers to the letters reference (1) and (2) above, whereby the Contractor has requested,
pursuant to Sub-Clause 20.1.4 (b) [Right to Vary] of the Conditions of Contract, that the Engineer
confirms
that the information, comments, clarifications and instructions, contained in the Engineer's response to
RFEI/0401/0592 and 'Wet and Damp Area Site Walk Report', constitute a formal Variation Order. The
Contractor records that, as of the date of this letter, the Engineer has failed to provide the necessary
confirmation of Variation or to issue an Engineer's instruction and revised Drawings and/or Specification
pursuant to Sub-Clauses 11.3.3 and 20.1.1 (a) of the Conditions of Contract.
The Contractor is currently progressing with the works as per the current IFC information and approved
shop drawings. The Contractor hereby notifies the Engineer that should the Engineer now issue an
instruction to implement any of the changes requested in RFEI/0401/0592 and/or 'Wet and Damp Area
Site Walk Report', there will be abortive works. It should be noted that the ROMs reference (3} and (4)
currently do not include the estimated cost for the abortive works. The Engineer/Employer shall be
responsible for any delays or disruptions to the Works, and the costs of any abortive works, as a result of
the Engineer's failure to provide the necessary confirmation of Variation or to issue an Engineer's
instruction and revised Drawings and/or Specification pursuant to Sub-Clauses 11.3.3 and 20.1.1 (a) of
the
Conditions of Contract, in a timely manner.
Yours faithfully,
