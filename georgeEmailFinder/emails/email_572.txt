Subject:

Initial Review of the Subcontractor’s Extension of Time Claim No.4

Dear Sir/Madam,
With reference to the above subject and further to letters (1), (2) and (3), please find enclosed our initial
comments as follows.
The Subcontractor’s response is surprising as it contradicts the Subcontractor’s agreement with the
points raised by the Contractor during a meeting in TCAJV site office on 11 October 2018, and
subsequently confirmed in the Contractor’s letter reference MTB/TCA/MOSART/L/000622 dated 16
October 2018.
Nevertheless, the Contractor hereby re-iterates and expands its responses to the Subcontractor’s
comments in the same order as the Subcontractor’s letters.
Subcontractor letter MMM/18/MTB/176 dated 19 November 2018

Item 1: The Contractor’s letter describes the Subcontractor’s lack of contractual compliance related to
timely delay notices and correspondences. The Subcontractor’s reply does not address the Contractor’s
comments, it refers to generic weekly reports.
Item 2/2a: The Subcontractor responded that the prospective delay fragnets presented in its claims are
interim and will be updated once access has been granted. In Contractor’s opinion, the amount of delay
in each window should only be assessed up to the cut-off date of each period. Prospective impacts
beyond the window period are/will remain theoretical until actualised in later window periods. One of
the reasons for not applying prospective impacts beyond the window is, it hides the true critical path at
the window cut-off period. i.e. impact events/fragnets should be applied/extended progressively in
successive windows until either actualised or forecast to the end of the last window.
Previously, (refer to Page 23, Paragraph 5.1.5 of the Subcontractor’s EOT Claim no. 4 submitted by letter
reference MMM/18/MTB/149 received on 17 September 2018) the Subcontractor stated; “The logic and activity dates of the update programme were amended at this point to accurately reflect
the impact upon subsequent activities resulting from the delay event.”
Accordingly, under item 2b (of Contractor letter MTB/TCA/MOSART/L/000622 dated 16 October 2018),
the Contractor requested Subcontractor to provide details of its amendments to the progress updates.
“The Subcontractor states that it has made amendments to its progress updates whilst preparing the
delay analysis. However, these changes are not listed or explained with the Subcontractor’s Claim No.4
submission.”
However, item 2b of the Subcontractor’s response/letter MMM/18/MTB/176 dated 19 November 2018
(quoted below), is inconsistent with its previous position.
“There have been no changes to the progress updates whilst preparing the TIA therefore the
Contractor’s comment in this respect is not valid.”
Item 2c(i.): The Subcontractor stated, “the updated progress programme is chosen as of “prior to” the
delay events in question, which is a basic principal of the TIA method”. Contractor agrees with this
statement in principle, subject to the following; 1.
The Subcontractor has used two progress updates with data dates 21 January 2018 and 22 July
2018 to carry out the TIA in Subcontractor’s EOT Claim No. 4. Based on the Subcontractor’s statement in
item-2c(i.), the Subcontractor has carried out TIA for delay events occurring after the data date 21
January 2018.
2.
Any delay which occurred prior to 21 January 2018 should be presented, using TIA’s, in the
Subcontractor’s EOT Claim Nos. 1 and 2. As explained below the Subcontractor has not carried out any
delay analysis (TIA) under EOT Claim 1 or 2.
Item 2c(ii.): The Subcontractor stated, “to establish the fact that there is no access to most of the areas,
it is sufficient to use a programme having a data of January 2018”. The Contractor agrees with this as a
general statement, the Subcontractor would be entitled to an EOT due to Contractor delays in providing

access. However, without a proper delay analysis which also considers concurrency, the number of
compensable delay days cannot be established.
Item 2c(iii.): The Subcontractor stated, “the delay events are mostly related to ‘design details’”. A claim
based on prospective fragnets may in theory produce entitlement to an EOT. However, the amount of
entitlement to EOT and compensable periods will depend on the liabilities for actual critical delays,
which can only be established through a proper delay analysis.
Previously, (refer to Pages 24-25, Paragraphs 5.3 – 5.4.1 of the Subcontractor’s EOT Claim no. 4
submitted by letter reference MMM/18/MTB/149 received on 17 September 2018) the Subcontractor
claimed that the TIA was carried out in windows. Window 1 starts in January 2018 and ends in March
2018. Window 2 starts in July 2018 and ends in August 2018. However, Contractor observed; 1.
If the Subcontractor had used TIA in windows, then the Subcontractor should have curtailed the
delay fragnet within the window period. i.e. It is not clear why the Subcontractor has used windows
when delay fragnets which start in January 2018 are shown extending through to 31 December 2018
2.
Also, the window periods should be continuous, i.e. there should not be a gap between March
2018 and July 2018.
Similarly, in item 2c,iv (of the Subcontractor’s response/letter MMM/18/MTB/176 dated 19 November
2018), the Subcontractor explained that the two TIA’s carried out with data dates of 21 January 2018
and 22 July 2018 were ongoing (interim). Accordingly, the assessment for entitlement under these delay
events will be finalised once the events have been actualised.
Item 2d: The Subcontractor stated, “delay events may contain “actual dates”, but the updated progress
programme does not contain any actual date greater than the data date”.
The screenshot below - taken from the Subcontractor’s TIA programme with data date 21 January 2018 shows the ‘original programme activities’ with progress/actual dates after the data date. The
Subcontractor stated, “delay events may contain “actual dates””. The Contractor agrees that delay
events before/left of the data date should use actual dates. However, activities after/right of the data
date are forecasts, should not be actualised for two reasons. Firstly, they obviously cannot have
happened at this time (if the data date is correct). Secondly, applying actual dates after the data date
incorrectly distorts the logical scheduling of the remaining activities, including the critical path.

Item-2e: The Subcontractor stated, “the only constraints, are on the fragnets”. The approved baseline
programme included six (6) constraints. The Subcontractor’s TIA programme dated 21 January 2018,
contains 261nr constraints, of which 84nr are applied to delay fragnet activities.
Adding constraints in fragnets can be acceptable. However, the Subcontractor should not make
modifications to baseline programme activities/logic through the addition of constraints (or other
measures) without reasonable explanation(s). The screenshot below – taken from the Subcontractor’s
TIA programme dated 21 January 2018 - provides examples of constraints added to the original baseline
programme activities.

Item 2f: The Subcontractor stated, “the TIA has not been reviewed properly, with comments raised
without an understanding of the programme, the delay events, and the way they are impacted”. The
Subcontractor’s statement is unacceptable given the examples below, which demonstrate the
Subcontractor’s improper application of TIA methodology.
The Subcontractor’s EOT claims are summarised in Table 1.

An EOT of 285 days had already been awarded prior to Subcontractor’s Claim No. 1, based on
Contractor’s Revision-6 Programme issued by letter references MTB/TCA/MOSART/L/000103 dated 25
March 2015 and MTB/TCA/MOSART/L/000110 dated 17 May 2015.
Based on the Contractor’s Revision-6 Programme, the Subcontract Commencement Date and the Time
for Completion were revised based on the Heads of Agreement (HOA) – 1 with the Employer dated 5
March 2015. The contractual dates and the revised dates based on HOA-1 are summarised in Table 2.

Accordingly, there was no requirement for a delay analysis for the 83 days period (Table 1) covered
under the Subcontractor’s EOT Claim No. 1. However, an analysis of concurrency is required to establish
the amount of compensable delay within Claim No.1.
EOT Claim no. 2 covers a period of 787 days (Table 1).
The Subcontractor’s EOT Claim No. 2 (letter reference MMM/18/MTB/024 received on 18 February
2018) provided only two sentences under Section 6, ‘Delay Analysis’:
1.
“The impact of delayed access has been inserted into the Updated Baseline Programme and
shows that completion of the Subcontract Works would have been delayed to 12th September 2017 due
to these events, which is beyond the period currently claimed in this Claim No 02 to 30th April 2017.”
2.

“The Time Impact Analysis is enclosed as Appendix C.”

Appendix C included a hard copy of a progress update (not a delay impact analysis) scheduled around
the end of November 2016 (data date not shown in the hard copy). There is no delay impact analysis
carried out by the Subcontractor.
Clearly the Subcontractor has not performed a credible TIA to establish its entitlement to any EOT within
the period ‘analysed’ (787 days).
EOT Claim No. 3 covers a period of 245 days (Table 1).
The Subcontractor’s EOT Claim No. 3 (letter reference MMM/18/MTB/043 received on 14 March 2018)
provided only two sentences under Section 6, ‘Delay Analysis’:
1.
“The impact of delayed access has been inserted into the Updated Baseline Programme and
shows that completion of the Subcontract Works would have been delayed to 11th October 2018 due to
these events, which is beyond the period currently claimed in this Claim No 03 to 31st December 2017.”
2.

“The Time Impact Analysis is enclosed as Appendix C.”

Appendix C included a hard copy of a progress update (not a delay impact analysis) as of February 2018.
There is no delay impact analysis performed by the Subcontractor in EOT Claim No.3.
Clearly the Subcontractor has not performed a credible TIA to establish its entitlement to any EOT within
the period ‘analysed’ (245 days).
EOT Claim No. 4 covers a period of 243 days (Table 1).
The Subcontractor’s EOT claim No. 4 (letter reference MMM/18/MTB/149 received on 17 September
2018) included TIA’s with data dates 21 January 2018 and 22 July 2018. These prospective TIA’s are
ongoing (interim) and will be assessed once the actualised delay impacts are submitted by the
Subcontractor.
Item 3: The Subcontractor stated, “we are currently preparing a full TIA of 48 monthly windows”.
Subcontractor letters MMM/18/MTB/181 dated 9 December 2018 and MMM/18/MTB/184 dated 15
December 2018
The Subcontractor has submitted TIA’s Part-1 and Part-2 (which combine to give 29 out of 48 monthly
window analyses), refer letter references MMM/18/MTB/181 dated 9 December 2018 and
MMM/18/MTB/184 dated 15 December 2018. The summary periods analysed in each part are; •
•
•

Part-1 contains the TIA’s for the period Yr.2015 – Yr.2016;
Part-2 contains the TIA’s for Yr.2017;
Part-3 - containing the TIA’s for Yr.2018 - is awaited from the Subcontractor.

The Contractor has made an initial review of the Subcontractor’s Part-1 and Part-2 submissions.
In both Part-1 and Part-2 submissions the Subcontractor concludes the executive summary as follows:

“The Subcontractor considers that it is entitled to an Extension of the Subcontract Time for Completion
as a result of the delay events occurring each month due to "DELAY DUE TO PARTIAL / NO ACCESS TO
WORK AREAS". The total Extension of the Subcontract Time for Completion claimed by the
Subcontractor will be presented in part-3 of the report.
The Costs arising as a result of the delay event are evaluated and will form part of the submission. The
details of Cost calculation will be provided in the final Part i.e. Part-3 of the report covering the whole
period from August 2015 till Dec 2018.”
Accordingly, the Subcontractor has not concluded any of its claims for EOT/Cost for the period 2015 2017 covered under Part-1 and Part-2.
The Subcontractor’s delay analysis methodology in Section 5, paragraphs 7 and 8 states; 7.
“The delay fragnets are added to each month, as a separate WBS-Delay Event. The delay
fragnets / activities are WIRs, based on their zones, level, sector, Section, and the Site access details /
request.”
8.
“The previous month file containing the delay events then becomes the base-file for the next
month delay events, this file is then updated in accordance with the available update / submitted
monthly update and delay fragnets for the current month are added to it. The Programme is scheduled
and analyzed. This process continues.”
The Subcontractor’s statement concerning the application of the TIA methodology is correct. However,
the Subcontractor (as illustrated in Table 3) has not in practice applied the method as written.
The purpose of performing a TIA in monthly window periods is to assess the impact/extent of and
determine liabilities for variations to the critical path in each ‘month’ due to delay, mitigation and/or
acceleration events.
However, the Subcontractor’s TIA report does not include a simple summary table of delay (claimed
entitlement or liabilities for the critical delays) within each window. The results of the Subcontractor’s
analysis are not evident in the narrative.
Instead, the Contractor has had to review the Subcontractor’s ‘detailed’ appendices to determine the
periods of delay claimed in each window. This has revealed several significant anomalies, refer Table 3 .

The
delay fragnet has no impact. The progress updates produce anomalous results (160 days delay in 28 day
update period).
The example in Table 3 shows that the delay fragnets did not impact the completion dates in the
Subcontractor’s 24 April 2016 and 22 May 2016 progress updates.
As noted in Table 3 the progress updates at 24 April 2016 and 22 May 2016 cover a period of 28 days.
However, the completion date forecast in each shows a difference of 160 days. Contractor has observed
that this is due to logic changes and other amendments applied to progress data, by the Subcontractor.
For example, removing actual dates (de-statusing) in the 22 May 2016 update that had been assigned in
the previous update.
The Subcontractor should use the original approved baseline programme (unamended) logic and any
additional logic should be applied using the delay fragnets.
The Subcontractor should review the progress updates and any discrepancies should be explained in the
delay analysis report. It is essential that the Subcontractor’s analysis is based on reliable and consistent
progress data.
In conclusion, the Subcontractor’s TIA submissions to date are inadequate, require thorough revision
and resubmission.
This is for your information, records, and immediate action.

Yours faithfully,
