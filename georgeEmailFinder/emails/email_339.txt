Subject:Delay Notification - Landscaping Access Release
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to your letter (1), in which you notify us of the purported failure to provide
access to landscaping areas on 13 June 2019 in accordance with the Rev 11.2 Baseline Programme.
Our ability to complete the landscaping works has been severly hampered by the various events and
circumstances outlined in our E-Notice No. 126, submitted by way of letter ref: (2), which includes
without limitation revisions to the contour level drawings issued on 3 and 19 March 2019. We record
that the latter set of drawing (Revsion 4) were “refined” to take account of various revisions and
additional information such as revsions to changes to fire hydrants, fence layouts and water feature
piping layouts that in turn caused you to issue revised resonses to various RFIs on 25 March 2019. We
have subsequently had to raise a further round of RFIs requesting confirmation of levels between 28
June 2019 and 21 July 2019, which you failed to respond to until 14 July 2019 and 17 August 2019.
Under the circumstances we strongly refute that we are in any way culpable for the alleged delays to
progress and completion of the landscaping; the facts reveal such delays have been caused by you.
While we remain fully committed to the Employer, the Project and to completing our obligations within
the shortest possible time, without compromising on safety and quality, we will not be held responsible
for such factors as those outlined above for which we are not culpable.
Yours faithfully,
