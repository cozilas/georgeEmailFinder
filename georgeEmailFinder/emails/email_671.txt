We are currently in the process of sourcing the labour market for a suitable replacement of Mr.
Raymond Rice, however due to the specialist requirements and the skills required, such an individual is
not readily available and therefore we have implemented interim measures to ensure continuity.
Mr. Umut Ceting was nominated as a suitable temporary replacement and place be assured that we are
confident in his abilities to manage the ground subsidence investigation and rectification works in the
interim. This tempoeraty solution will not function as an isolated effort by the aforementioned
individual. Together with our in house expertise, support personnel and senior management this

You will be informed at the earliest once we are in a position to make such an appointment and we
confirm that the current arrangement will stay intact to avoid any disruption and likely delays that might
incur by removing Mr. Umut Cetin at this stage.
Yours faithfully,
