Subject:Clause 27.1.1: Notice of Claim
Delay Notice No. 1099 – Delays to the Two-Hour Fire Rated Ceiling System
Dear Sir
On or about 7 October 2017, the Contractor raised RFVO/0401/1598-SC/039/B Rev. 00 associated with
provision of a new 2 hour fire-rated ceiling system following the Engineer’s response to RFI/0401/10736.
However, despite the Engineer not responding until in excess of four months later, on 26 February 2018,
the Engineer was of the view that no Variation was warranted and no Instruction would be issued. This
caused the Contractor to write to the Engineer on 10 March 2018 (ref: 1), comprehensively setting out
the basis for entitlement to a Variation and an Engineer’s Instruction. The Engineer has so far failed to
reply.

In its subsequent letter dated 25 June 2018 (ref: 2), the Contractor informed the Engineer that it has still
yet to receive a response to its request for a VO and EI, and resultantly, this act of prevention was
similarly preventing the ceiling works from proceeding. The Contractor reminded the Engineer of the
main points at issue as well as urged the Engineer to issue revised IFC design information and
accompanying Instruction.
However, at the date of preparing this Delay Notice No. 1099, the Engineer has so far failed to reply.
The Engineer’s continued failure to provide the requisite fire-rated ceiling design information is
continuing to prevent the Contractor from coordinating and finalising the approval of Shop Drawings
and undertaking the ceiling works. Absent any action on the Engineer’s / Employer’s Design
Consultant’s part, this will impact the approval of Shop Drawings and Material Submittals, and impact
procurement and installation of equipment, cabling and data provisions plus associated works. Such
action or inaction represents a clear act of prevention on the part of the Employer’s Personnel and / or
Consultants. Accordingly, this will invariably impact the Contractor’s ability to achieve inter alia
Milestones MS06, MS08A, MS08B, MS09A.1, MS09A.2, MS09A.3, MS09A.4, MS09A.5, MS09A.6,
MS09A.7, MS9A.6, and Milestones MS09B and MS10.
Therefore, in accordance with Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1, the Contractor
hereby notifies the Engineer of its entitlement to claim:
(i)
An extension of the Time for Completion of the Works pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c); and
(ii)
An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.2 pursuant to Clause 9.10, or,
in the alternative, damages for breach of Contract.
Interim and / or final details of the Time impacts and adjustment to the Contract Price, will be provided
in due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.5(a), (b) and (c).
Yours faithfully,
