Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to its letter at reference 1 above regarding straight stairs of more than two flights
and in particular to the date of 02 May 2015 for submission of its fully detailed claim for the same.

Due to the fact that there has been a large number of Engineer's Instructions issued simultaneously in
recent times and coupled with the fact that the Contractor is currently preparing its combined claim for
revised ELS requirements, the Contractor respectfully requests the Engineer's consent to extend the
date for submission of the fully detailed claim for Claim Number 012 from 02 May 2015 to 02 June 2015.

Yours faithfully,
