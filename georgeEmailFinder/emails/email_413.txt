Engineer’s Response to RFI/0401/16803, RFI/0401/16865, RFI/0401/16852, RFI/0401/16929 –
Requirement for Door Position Sensor to Shaft Access Hatches – Request for Engineer’s Instruction /
Variation Order (VO)
Dear Sir

Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described below
may cause delay and/or disruption to the Works, hence we seek your swift resolution of the same.
The Event(s):
Between 30 January 2019 and 11 March 2019, we submitted the following four (4) RFIs, requesting
further clarification of the design and scope of works associated with various shaft accesses located
inside of the BOH rooms to various areas and levels of the Main Terminal Building (Table 1 refers).
Specifically, the existing IFC Drawings failed to provide any details on the precise location and design of
the access panels, hence, the RFIs provided some recommendations based on the site conditions.

Firstly, we wish to record the inordinate amount of time taken by you to respond to each of the RFIs
listed above. At this stage of the Project, for you to take upwards of 107 calendar days to reply and
respond to the various matters subject to these RFIs, is wholly unacceptable and will invariably knock on
and have a consequential impact on our progress and delay us; this delay was wholly avoidable.
It is therefore ironic that your delayed responses, which we hasten to add, details a requirement for
additional work [see below], contain comments to the effect that we are expected to agree to carry out
such work but ensure “there are no adverse time or cost impact[s] to the Client”.
Secondly, having provide you with a detailed study of the location of the access panels to various areas
and locations of the MTB, taking cognisance of the status of the Works, we are somewhat taken back by
your responses, all of which inform us that “[you / the Employer’s Design Consultant] take no exception
to the Contractor's proposals to coordinate appropriately sized maintenance access …”. This comment is
then followed by a lengthy list of requirements including without limitation a comment that “All access
panels to be equipped with SACS type-0 (Door position sensor)”, which you brazenly expect us to
provide and/or comply with but not only does this fall outside of our scope of works and will warrant
and EI / VO, but as noted, we are expected to accommodate the time and cost impacts.
This is unacceptable also.
We wish to put on record that your response to all four (4) RFIs listed in Table 1 have requested the
provision of SACS Type-0 (Door Position Sensors) which represent substantial changes to our scope of
Works, since the requirement for shaft access doors and accompanying sensors is not mentioned in the
Specifications nor are they detailed within any current IFC Drawings. If so instructed, this will involve
the following additional works involving the coordination of numerous subcontractors:
•
Procurement and installation of DPS systems;
•
Connect the DPS to the closest Door Control Unit (DCU). In case there are no DCUs in the area
surrounding the access door, a new DCU will have to be installed; and
•
In case a new DCU is installed, data outlets and power to the DCU are required to be installed.

In light of the foregoing, in the event that any RFI responses attempt to introduce additional works
beyond our existing scope, and that of our Subcontractors, which clearly the RFI responses do so in this
case, then this requires a valid Engineer’s Instruction (EI) and a Variation Order (VO).
The SAA8 laid down strict guidelines to follow if additional works are required. However, on the face of
it, you failed to honour those obligations and an EI and VO are needed for us to proceed with the
implementation of SACS type-0 (DPS) on wall access panels for shaft accesses, as discussed above.
We therefore, take this opportunity in reminding you of the provisions of Clause 2.29 to Clause 2.31 of
SAA8 pertaining to Variations, in so far as we are not to proceed with any Variation until a Variation
Order and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. In which respect, it is your obligation to issue this
Time/Cost Record first if you wish to instigate change; this is only after the additional time and/or costs
impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.
Meanwhile, until such time as you take the action required of you in accordance with SAA8 Clause 2.29,
we are unable to proceed with implementing the changes noted above. We trust this is clear.
Potential Impact:
Any requirement for additional works, in this case, the provision of SACS type-0 (DPS) to wall access
panels for shaft accesses and to the various areas and levels noted above , at such a late stage of the
Project, is very likely to impact upon our ability to achieve Milestone MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required:
It is for this reason therefore, that we issue this E-Notice requesting your prompt action, guidance,
decision or further instruction as may be applicable to resolve the matters referenced herein in order to
mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works. This includes without limitation:
1.
Issuing such Instruction as necessary for us to instigate the required changes into the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within ten (10) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
Yours faithfully,
