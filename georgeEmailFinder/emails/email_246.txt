Sub: Site Memo 02732 Issued by AECOM
Dear Sir,
Thank you for your above referenced letter containing a copy of Site Memo 02732. Having reviewed
Site Memo 02732 we have come to the obvious conclusion that the onus is on TCA N to close and
control the raised defect notification.
We refer TCA N to our previous letter ref: MTB-SMD-TCAN-L-0461 dated 24111 January 2018
whereby we attached a detailed Incident Analysis Report concerning damage inflicted on PBSS x-ray
screening machines in Level3.0 due to an unauthorized relocation of our equipment.
Please note that the aforementioned Site Memo is also related to this very same subject whereby
equipment has been relocated to an area deemed unfit for the purposes of storage due to an
incomplete
roof exposing the equipment to rain and surface flooding. It was these very reasons why we strongly
advised and refused to allow the relocation of the equipment in the first place.
Therefore, Smiths Detection will not be held accountable for the unauthorized relocation of our
equipment by TCAJV and as such will not be responsible for the closure of the Site Memo 02732.
Furthermore, as per your letter we in tum ask that you provide the 'due dates' when the equipment will
be assigned a suitable storage location, dates that should be forthcoming having held a site visit on the
same day as this letter to ascertain what action TCA N will take to rectify the situation.
We trust that the above mentioned confirmation is sufficiently clear and remain at your disposal for any
further information you may require with regard to this matter.
Yours truly,
