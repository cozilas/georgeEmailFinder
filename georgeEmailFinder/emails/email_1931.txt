Dear Sir,

The Contractor's interpretation of Engineer's Instruction No. 145 is incorrect. Engineer's Instruction 145
clearly instructs the following:

1)
"Implement the change of public name from 'Qatar National Museum' to 'National Museum of
Qatar' for all newly produced documents"; and
2)

"Technical name and existing documents shall not be changed."

Therefore, it is expressly implied that all future documents shall include the new name 'National
Museum of Qatar' and at the same time it is implied that this new name is to be utilised in all future
communication both internaland external.

For clarity, please understand that the Engineer's Instruction does not require existing documents to be
altered.
Yours faithfully,
