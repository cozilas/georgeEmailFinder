Subject Monthly Updated Programmes
Dear Sir,
We write to reiterate our ongoing concerns regarding the accuracy of the submitted Monthly Updated
Programmes.
The purpose of the Monthly Updated Programme, and as you are aware, is to provide a complete and
accurate report of the Project's status, records and progress. Pursuant to Clause 16.3.2 "Such updated
Programme shall be submitted with the Contractor's monthly progress report {clause 12.27} {Progress
Report) and shall be at least as detailed as the initial Programme developed pursuant to clause 16.3.1
and shall show actual start and finish dates for activities and the forecast start and finish dates for
activities have not yet started or finished. The Employer, the Engineer and the Consultant shall be
entitled to rely upon the Programme when planning their activities".
We note that the Monthly Updated Programme for the month ending May 2019 evidenced no delays
whatsoever to Milestone MS9C. We further note that to date, the Contractor's Management and
Principals have repetitively committed, during the weekly Chairmans' Meetings and up until the last
meeting dated 26 June 2019, that the project completion date remains 31 October 2019. The same
was committed to in all weekly Risk Committee Meetings.
Although the updated Programme is expected to be predicting an accurate completion date, we
record that on 30 June 2019 the following dates for Milestone MS9C were issued via (1) in TIA No.1 for
alleged delays post SAA8, and via (2) for the completion of the subsidence work:
1. MS9C completing by 6 April 2020 (1).
2. MS9C completing by 31 October 2020 (2).
The updated Programme is therefore considered to be outdated and misleading to all Project Parties
and Stakeholders. As reiterated earlier by the Engineer via the monthly responses to previous updated
Programmes (refer to attached emails) the logic adopted in the Programme is also not accepted.
Accordingly, the Contractor's failure to provide an updated Programme which is in compliance with
the Contract requirements can result in preventing the Engineer from effectively assessing any
submitted claims in a timely manner and in hindering the Employer, the Engineer and the Design
Consultant on relying upon the Programme when planning their activities.
We refer the Contractor to the NCR issued via (3) for the Progress Programme and Monthly Report
submission delays and non-compliance with the Contractors' contractual obligations. This NCR shall
remain open as it is still pending the Contractor's rectification and compliance, and shall be revisited
by the Engineer based on the current development.
Pursuant to Clause 16.3.3, the Contractor is urgently requested to submit a revised Programme

complying with the requirements set out in Clause 16.3.1, not later than 7 days from the date of
receipt of this letter.
We hereby reserve the Employers' rights pursuant to Clause 10.3 of the Conditions of Contract for any
delays and/or costs incurred as a result of the Contractor's delays and non-compliance .
yours faithfully

Subject:Post SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0113
Engineer’s Response to RFI/0401/17064 – Re-introduction of Door No. L30-0672-01 – Request
for Engineer’s Instruction (RFEI) / Variation Order (VO)
Dear Sir
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and/or disruption to the Works and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
Your response to the RFI/0401/17064 detailed in Annex A represents a change in design and scope and
requires a valid EI and VO in order for us to integrate the same into the Works.
Potential Impact
Any requirement for additional works, such as that outlined herein and at this stage of the Project, is
increasingly likely to impact on achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within seven (7) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
On 24 April 2019, we raised RFI/0401/17064 (dated 23 April 2019), requesting further clarification as to
whether Door Ref: ‘L30-0672-01’ (Located in the Janitor’s Closet to the Public Male Toilets within Sector
5.23 to Level L3.0, that had previously been omitted from our scope), was required or not.
We requested a response to RFI/0401/17064 by 30 April 2019; however, you failed to reply for a further
11 calendar days, i.e. on 11 May 2019. Added to which you advised that the door in question “still
exists” but is not a TPS [Toilet Partition] door. Moreover, attached to your response was two (2)
sketches enumerated as ‘ASK 4065 (RFI-17604)’ Sheet 1 of 2 and Sheet 2 of 2; which for all intents,
consists of a marked up / clouded IFC Drawing plus a partial extract of a revised Door Schedule.
On this basis, it is clear that the re-introduction of door ‘L30-0672-01’ represents a change. However,
given that SAA8 laid down strict guidelines to follow if additional works are required and you appear to
have ignored those obligations, then this change will warrant a valid Engineer’s Instruction (EI) and a
Variation Order (VO) if you require us to proceed with integrating the revised scope into the Works.
We remind you of the provisions of Clause 2.29 to Clause 2.31 of SAA8 pertaining to Variations, in so far
as we are not to proceed with any Variation until a VO and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. It
is your obligation to issue this Time/Cost Record first if you wish to instigate change; but this is only after
the additional time and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.

Meanwhile, until such time as you take the action required of you in accordance with SAA8 Clause 2.29,
we are unable to proceed with implementing the changes noted herein. We trust this is clear.
Yours faithfully,
