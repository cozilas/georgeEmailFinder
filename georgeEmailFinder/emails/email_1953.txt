Dear Sir,

The Consultant is hereby instructed to proceed with the implementation of the optimization of the
Station Entrances in accordance with the Engineer's Instruction reference 1), with the following
exceptions:

Entrance 03 at Al Sadd Station not to be optimized, only the L11 elevator to be removed, thus the
structure and the canopy of this Entrance will remain unaffected;

Entrances 03, 04 and 05 at Sport City Station to be optimized by deleting only one elevator and by
replacing the escalator that is closest to the elevator with a stair. In addition, civil provisions in the
design, such as pits, for the future installment of the escalator will be maintained.

These exceptions are in line with the Client's letter reference M006-GDB-ENG-LTR-01029 dated 31 July
2016 to the Engineer's Assistant and enclosed herewith for the Consultant's ease of reference.

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification. Yours faithfully,
