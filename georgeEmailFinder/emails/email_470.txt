Subject:Re: Delays to CCM works
Dear Sir,
We acknowledge receipt of your letter (2) above regarding the subject matter and we put on record that
most of the issues in regards to stone installation discussed in the letters (1 and 2), have now been
resolved. However, we also put on record that your grouting works are still ongoing in numerous
locations including some of the locations discussed in the aforesaid letters.
In view of the above, you are requested to take all necessary actions to expedite the completion of your
works to enable CCM and other subcontractors to proceed with their works.
We are also taking this opportunity to request you to always liaise with our construction team and other
Subcontractors to coordinate your works as per Clause 12.12 [Other Contractors and Other
Subcontractors]. This can be established by means of continuous communication with our construction
team and other Subcontractors, to ensure the timely commencement and completion of the works.
This is for your information and records.
Yours faithfully,
