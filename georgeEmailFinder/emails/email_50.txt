Subject: Subcontractors lack of Progress (as of 31 March 2018)
Dear Sir,
Further to notice of delay. references (1) to {17) issued in ·respect of the slow progress of the
Subcontract
Works, the Contractor reiterates its concerns in -relation to·the Subcontractor's performance arnd its
ability. to
achieve the completion dates set out in both rev. 10.4 of the Programme in the memorandum of
understanding no. 4 (MOU) for the release of on-account:payments to the Subcontractor.
In addition to the Subcontractor's inabilit¥ to meet its target completion dates, the main concern is the
Subcontractor' s continued· failure to manage its supply chain-effectively and, in particular EFP, who is
its sole
supplier for all aluminium composite panels (ACP) material ·r-equired to complete the wrapper roofs,
gate houses, central processor (CP') soffit, ·bullnose fascia and infill.panels.
Further, the Contractor records its worries in 'fespect of the :progress of the CP main roof west soffit
accress
hanging scaffold, as the current rate of erection may jeopardise 'the overall target completion of the
soffit.
In relation to the above, please find below a summary table depicting the status of the on-goirng
activities as
of 28 March 2018 which is self-explanatory: Considering the productivity rates achieved by the
Subcontractor thus far, the Contractor is concerned that
the coming completion dates will also not be achieved.
Main issues relating to programme, procurement and labour resources that require the Subcontractor's
immediate attention are summarised hereunder:
Programme:
lnfill north: failure to meet the agreed completion date on 31 March 2018 and the current target
completion is by 30 April 2018.
lnfill gutters: still not completed and significantly behind programme.

lnfill standing seam: still not completed despite rev. 10.4 of the Programme scheduling completion on
26 February 2018 for the south infill and on 07 March 2018 for the north infill.
CP skylight ACP: due for completion by 31 January 2018; yet, the delivery of material will not be
completed until30 April2018 and with installation scheduled to be completed by 17 May 2018.
Wrapper ACP: north and south requires 4,456m2 completed by 31 May 2018, which equates to 495m2
per week for the next nine weeks. (However, the Subcontractor's average for the last two months is
279m2 per week and the final ACP material delivery is not scheduled until 28 May 2018).
Gatehouses ACP: non-completed gatehouses since 27 Feb 2017 and, whilst GH11, GH22 and GH24 are
imminent, the Subcontractor still has 45 no. gatehouses to complete by 03 November 2018. CP main
roof: perimeter gutters still not completed (e.g. west and east}, perimeter bullnose (excl.
soffit area} not scheduled to be completed until 31 August 2018 and exhaust towers not scheduled to
be completed until19 July 2018.
Wrapper roofs: skylight flashings not scheculed to be completed until 28 June 2018 and exhaust
towers until 30 June 2018.
lnfill: inclined glazing head panels not scheduled to be completed until 31 May 2018, inclined louvres
until17 May 2018 and bullnose fascia not until15 July 2018.
Procurement:
Labour:
CP skylight ACP deliveries not planned to be completed until 30 April 2018; as highlighted above, the
installation of the CP skylight ACP should have been completed on 31 January 2018.
Perimeter bullnose fascia deliveries not planned to be completed until 30 June 2018; yet, the
completion date for these installation works in the Programme is 31 May 2018.
CP exhaust tower material deliveries not planned to be completed until 01 June 20118 and the
wrappers until10 June 2018.
Wrapper skylight flashing deliveries not planned to be completed until 20 June 2018; yet the wrapper
should have been completed in December 2017.
lnfilllouvre deliveries not planned to be completed until 31 May 2018
lnfill bullnose fascia deliveries not planned to be completed until 31 May 2018 (south) and 30 June
2018 (north}.
The Subcontractor's labour resources appear to have plateaued irrespective of the substantial backlog
of incomplete Subcontract Works.
In view of the lack of site progress witnessed vis-a-vis the Subcontract Works and in the absence of any
mitigation measures implemented by the Subcontractor thus far, please be notified that, in the opinion
of the
Contractor, the performance of the installation works is such that it may result in the Contractor not
achieving
its own obligations under the Contract. Therefore, tl'le Subcontractor is requested to take all reasonable
steps
to ensure completion of these works in accordance with its contractual obligations under Sub-Clause
8.1.2
and Sub-Clause 16.1.1 of the Conditions of Subcontract.

The Contractor advises the Subcontractor that the continued slippage to the target completion dates
resulting
from the Subcontractor's slow progress may be treated as Concurrent Delay pursuant to the provisions
of the
Conditions of Subcontract. Please be further reminded that the Contractor's rights under the provisions
of
Sub-Clause ·10.3 [Contractor's Claims] and Sub-Clause 16.6 [Delay Damages] are reserved.
Yours faithfully,
