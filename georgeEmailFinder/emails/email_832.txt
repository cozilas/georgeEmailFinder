Subject:RE: Notice of Back charge- Damage to Chadwick’s Glass in North Infill Vertical Skylight

Dear Sir,
We write in response to your letter referenced (2) above, regarding your rejection of the backcharges
forwarded to you via our letter referenced (1) as per the subject matter. Please note that in your letter
you are alleging that the damage was not caused by you due to the fact that the glass was damaged on
the outside (roof-side). However, your allegation is rejected due to the following reasons:
1.
The glass was hit at the top part of the panel as a result of a scaffold tube drop from one of your
personnel;
2.
There have been a lot of people on site witnessing the scaffold tube drop and confirmed that it
was Cloisall’s personnel.
In view of the above, your letter referenced (2) is rejected and we hereby inform you that the
backcharges will be applied accordingly, as discussed previously and further explained herein.
We trust the above clarifies the situation and we consider this matter closed.
Yours faithfully,
