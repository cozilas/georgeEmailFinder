Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to letter reference 1) and the latest discussions regarding the Engineer's
Assistant's request for a revised quotation and programme for the design and construction of a Metro
passage connection between Qatar National Museum and the Museum Park.

Further to the Engineer's Assistant's request, the Contractor encloses herewith its revised quotation and
programme for the Metro passage connection between Qatar National Museum and the Museum Park.

The estimated structural, civil, MEP, architectural finishes and utility relocation design and construction
cost is provided for budgeting purposes only, and it does not include any other additional cost that may
arise as a consequence of a late Instruction, such as the cost of rework or abortive design, especially for
the Qatar National Museum station concourse level. These costs (if any) will be addressed under
separate cover.

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.

Yours faithfully,
