Dear Sirs,

Further to the Contractor's fully detailed initial interim Claim Nr 036 submission issued under cover of
reference 9 and, further to a subsequent January 2016 monthly Claim Nr 036 update issued under cover
of reference 2, the Contractor hereby provides its February 2016 monthly update of said Claim in
accordance with General Condition ("GC") 20.1.6(b) of Volume 3 of the Contract.

The quantum of the delay and the extension of time entitlement has not changed from the previous
January 2016 monthly update for Claim Nr 036 contained within the below table:

Completion Milestone

Contract "Time for Completion" (TND) Impacted I Delayed "Time for Completion" Due to Claim/Delay
Event (Delay Event ended upon effective date of
20.12.15).

Delay (Calendar Days) - Extension of Time Entitlement

TUNNEL SECTION:
Tunnel - Doha Zoo to Al
Rayyan South (Design only) (Ref M006.YW.BB.ZOO)

31.07.16

09.01.17

Tunnel - Al Rayyan South
to Muaither (Design only) (Ref M006.YW.BB.RYS)

31.07.16

09.01.17

162

Therefore, (as per the January 2016 Claim Nr 036 update) due to the Claim Event/Delay
EvenVSuspension, the Contractor is currently entitled to an extension of 162 days to the Time for
Completion for (1) the (Design of) Tunnel Section 'Doha Zoo to Al Rayyan South' (Section Ref

M006.YW.BB.ZOO) and, (2) the (Design of) Tunnel Section 'Al Rayyan South to Muaither' (Section Ref
M006.YW.BB.RYS} , pursuant to GC 8.4.1(b) and GC 8.9.1(a) of Volume 3 of the Contract and, pursuant
to Article 172.1 (good faith) and Article 220 (unjust enrichment) of the Qatar Civil Code (Law No 22 of
2004).

The Contractor confirms that no further costs information in relation to Claim Nr 036 has been received
by the Contractor over the past month. However, to date, the Contractor has received no payment from
the Employer with respect to Claim Nr 036. Accordingly, the Contractor provides this February 2016
Financial monthly update to Claim Nr 036 as follows.

As mentioned within the January 2016 monthly update, the Contractor received its Lead Designer's
claim FCN 115 with respect to the resumption of design to Al Rayyan Station and the related Tunnel
Sections. The sum taken to value within the Contractor's Claim Nr 036 January 2016 monthly update
with respect to FCN 115 is OAR 876,680.00 plus, the Contractor's overheads and profit ("OHP") addition
of OAR 113,968 .00. Finance costs are therefore due from the Contractor's receipt of FCN 115 on 21
January 2016:

(QAR 876,680.00 (50% of FCN 115 as per January 2016 update) + QAR 113,968.00 (OHP on last)) x 39
days (21 January 2016 to 29 February 2016)/365 days x 4.25% p.a. (Finance rate) = QAR 4,499.00.

OHP upon Finance costs = OAR 4,499.00 x 13% (OHP rate) = QAR 585.00.

Therefore, total Finance Costs including OHP upon same = QAR 4,499.00 + QAR 585.00 = QAR 5,084.00

This provides a February 2016 updated Financial Summary for Claim 036 as follows:

Accordingly, Claim Nr 036's revised and claimed value to 29 February 2016 is QAR 995,732.00.

As the Claim Event giving rise to this Claim has a continuing effect and the Contractor is still collating
further particulars, the Contractor shall be submitting further interim Claim submissions with respect to
the Claim Event giving rise to Claim Nr 036 at monthly intervals as required by GC 20.1.6(b).

Yours faithfully,
