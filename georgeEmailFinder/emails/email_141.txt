Subject: Subcontractor's and Sub-Subcontractor's Dormakaba Lack of Superintendence
Dear Sir,

Further to the Contractor's letter references {1) to (3) which notified the Subcontractor of the on-going
delays to the installation of the doors for PrA and PrD, the Contractor records the Subcontractor's and
its
Sub-Subcontractor's Dormakaba continuous lack of performance vis-a-vis the progress of these works.
The Contractor regrets that, despite holding numerous meetings with both the Subcontractor and
Dormakaba, there continues to be an evident lack of superintendence on Site. To be clear, attending a
meeting does neither deprive the Subcontractor nor Dormakaba from their obligation to supervise the
works being undertaken on Site.
Moreover, despite assuring that the labour resources would be increased to 20 by 07 March 2018,
Dormakaba has only mobilised 8 workers thus far; this is unacceptable considering that all bays on the
PrD
are available to the Subcontractor to work and that there is a substantial volume of steel elements
delivered to Site which are pending installation. The Contractor reiterates its request that a two weeks
look-ahead programme loaded with resources and plant/access equipment is submitted without further
delay.
Pursuant to Clause 10.3 [Contractor's Claims] and Clause 16.6 [Delay Damages] of the Conditions of
Subcontract, the Subcontractor is notified that all rights under these Clauses are reserved.
Yours faithfully,
