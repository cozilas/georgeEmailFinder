Dear Sir,

The Engineer's Assistant (EA) refers to letter reference 1) & 2), wherein the Contractor was directed to
submit a quotation for any cost and time impact. Following the issuance of EA's clarifications under
letter reference 6) with regards to the Contractor's letter reference 5), the EA now believes that the
Contractor has all the required information.

Considering the size of the work, the EA provides a revised response period of 28 days from the date of
receipt of this letter for the Contractor to response in compliance with the Sub-Clause 13.2.2

This is a reminder of the obligation pursuant to Sub-Clause 3.3.2 to comply with the instructions given
by the Engi eer.

The Co tractor shall provide the quotation without any furth Â¥iW.SfJ r-- Go-.-d-:-;L--l;n- e"""'."'.'n_de_rg_ro_u_n_d--
