Subject: Revised Schedule of Workable Areas With
Dear Mr. Leka,
We are writing to formally inform you that due to the continuing adverse impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic on the Project, we are constrained to limit access to the site offices and redefine the areas
where Project works are allowed to prosper despite the prevailing community quarantine in and
around Cebu City. This will take effect on the 22nd of July 2020 and will continue for two (2) weeks
thereafter or until further notice. This is also in line with Engineer’s and Employer’s concern and latest
consideration in respect of these worrying developments around the COVID-19 spread in Cebu and
particularly in the city of Cebu.
As you may be aware of, despite CLJV’s best endeavors and efforts to control the spread of the
COVID-19 virus by housing our skeletal workforce and implementing the most stringent protocols of
having personnel undergo Rapid Test and securing medical clearance as mandatory requirements
before engagement at work, the pandemic has been heavily impacting the Project’s workforce for
the recent past weeks. This has become a very serious concern which we need to prevent from
becoming an outbreak in the Project.
Resumption of works despite the prolonged ECQ in Cebu City has been very risky and challenging
for all of us but, on the other hand, we believe that somehow it has helped our partners slowly recover
from this pandemic. Through it all, the health and welfare of our people and partners has always
remained our top priority.
Please get in touch with the CLJV Area Manager in your work area for operations-related concerns
to inform your personnel at site of the proper transition and securing of any material/asset and/or
equipment for work areas that were previously occupied but may be inaccessible or may have very
limited access in the next two weeks. For any planned movement of your personnel in and out of the
CLJV barracks, kindly consult with CLJV’s HSS Department beforehand for proper guidance.
In closing, we would like to solicit your full support and cooperation and your kind understanding of
the situation.
Yours faithfully,
