Subject:Notice for Uninformed Absences

Dear Sir,
With reference to the above subject, this is to put on record that on Saturday 31 October 2020, your
manpower did not report to work on the DEWA Project.
This unscheduled absence and the failure of your manpower to report to work, have resulted in a
substantial loss of productivity for the works which were planned to be carried out on the day, which
will inevitably have a knock-on effect and will further delay the works.
This is just one of many related absenteeism issues that are continuing to delay and disrupt the progress
of the Works, and is having a direct impact on the progress and the completion of the works.
As a consequence of your actions, this letter serves as a written notice that one (1) working day will be
deducted as a penalty, based on the number of workers which were absent on the 31 October 2020.
Please ensure that appropriated steps are being taken on your part, in order to avoid the reoccurrence
of such events in the future.
Yours faithfully,
