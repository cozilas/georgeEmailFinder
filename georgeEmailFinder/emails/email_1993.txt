Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to its previous correspondence under letters references 2) and 3) with regards to
the Station Area Planning.

On 01 September 2015, the Employer submitted to the Contractor, by means of an informal email under
reference MOOO-QRC-INFM-010596 - CP0_ 15_04534 SAP for Gold Line Underground Stations, the
following SAP drawings:

In addition, the Contractor has obtained informal SAP drawings for the Al Sadd (V8_0) and AlWaab
(V11_0) Stations from CPO.

Upon receipt of the above drawings, the Contractor duly informed the Engineer's Assistant, under letter
reference 2), that notwithstanding the absence of formal issuance of the SAP drawings from the
Engineer under the relevant instruction, the Contractor would proceed with the detailed design in order
to mitigate further delay and urged the Engineer and the Employer to assist in obtaining the SAP
drawings for the remaining stations (Souq Waqif and Joaan) as soon as possible.
Astonishingly, the so called "latest" drawings also included older versions of SAP requirements. For
Qatar National Museum Station the Engineer's Assistant provided V 12_0 (V13_0 was provided by the
Employer to the Contractor on 01 September 2015) and for Bin Mahmoud Station the Engineer's
Assistant provided V6 O (V7_0 was provided by the Employer to the Contractor on 01 September 2015).

Subsequent to the Engineer's letter reference 1), the Contractor received from the CPO (via email on 25
November 2015) an updated summary table outlining the latest SAP drawings for all Stations. The table
below presents the current status:

Change on size of Entrance 1.2 and road layout; Plaza landscaped area added

Further to the above, it is evident that the SAP requirements are in continuous development. It is also
evident that there is a disconnect between the information provided by the Engineer's Assistant's and
the information that is current with the CPO.

On the other hand, the Contractor shall not accommodate any further SAP related changes to the design
unless formally instructed. Such instruction, if issued by the Engineer, will inevitably cause further delay
and will be addressed in accordance with the provisions of the Conditions of Contract.

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.
Yours faithfully,
