Subject:Pier 4 and 3 Cleaning Activities
We write in connection to the Contractor's cleaning activities which are currently underway in Pier 4
and 3. You are proceeding with the cleaning of various finishes surfaces and materials without having
an approved method statement in place.
The documentation currently available highlights that the cleaning techniques and materials used are
not fully aligned with the cleaning instructions and recommended products in the applicable
Operation and Maintenance Manuals.
It is also observed that you are using cleaning products and practices which introduce an unacceptable
risk of damages to these finishes, i.e. the use of metal blade scrapers on glazing and stainless steel
finished surfaces. Other cleaning activities have not been verified as either being acceptable or
compatible by the finishes manufacturers /subcontractors.
In order to minimize the potential for serious and widespread damages resulting from uncontrolled
cleaning and the resulting potential of major defects rectification works, it is imperative that the
Contractor submits a method statement that is fully aligned with the contents of the OMMs and that
all works are diligently supervised to ensure that the cleaning activities do comply with these
approvals.
We enclose herewith the reports the Engineer has already provided to you that captures our concerns
and comments on the ongoing cleaning operations. The Contractor is therefore requested to provide
its action plan to address all concerns raised within three (3) working days from the date of receipt of
this letter.
Yours faithfully,
