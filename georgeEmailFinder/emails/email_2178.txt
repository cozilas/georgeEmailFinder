Dear Sir,

The Engineer's Assistant refers to letter reference 1). wherein the Contractor was directed to submit a
quotation for any cost or time impact and subsequently reminded by reference 2). Although the
Contractor failed to respond, Engineer's Instruction reference 3) was issued and followed by reference
4) and 5), confirming the provisions of Sub-Clause 13.2.1 still applied. The last reminder, reference 7),
was due by 25 August 2016.
The Engineer's Assistant must now conclude that the Contractor is unwilling to provide the directed
quotation given that a total period of 511 days have lapsed without submission of a quotation.
Absent compliance with the Engineer's direction, the Engineer is now compelled to complete his assess
ent of the Variation without input from the Contractor.
Dear Sir,
This is a direction under Sub-Clause 13.2.1 for the Contractor to submit a quotation (both as to price and
any possible time impact) for the Variation proposed by the Engineer, namely the deletion of the Diesel
Generators in Stations and Tunnel Power Supply Substations .

The proposed variation allows for Diesel Generators to be deleted from metro stations as Qatar Rrail's
multiple redundancies in tne power supply system are by means of two Station Power Supply
Substations (SPS) at either site of a metro station. At this level there is 100% SPS redundancy . If SPS 1
fails, SPS 2

can provide the full load. The room allocation for Diesel Generators (70m2

is to remain for Systems use.

The room allocation for Diesel Tanks (30m2) can be deleted, providing the overall space requirements
for the stations are met.
The Contractor shall submit the quotation within 14 days of this direction. Yours faithfully,
