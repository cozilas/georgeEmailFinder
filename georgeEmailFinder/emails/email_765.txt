Subject: Subcontractor's Claim no. C-188 Water leakage on BHS Conveyors in l02-Final Claim
Dear Sir,
We hereby respond to your above referenced correspondence related to your final claim for additional
costs for
"188 Water Leakage on BHS Conveyors in L02".
We maintain our position that you have failed to administer the claim in accordance with Subcontract
Agreement
Conditions of Contract Clause 27 .1.5. We would dispute your assertion that "all activities are
interrelated hence all
events can have continuing effects". With no substantiation that the reported minor water leak Jed to
any damage, it
is subsequently unreasonable to believe that this event had a cont inuing effect of approaching one
year.
Notwithstanding the above, we again highlight that the "Final Claim" fails to furnish any reason that the
alleged
water leak was the Contractor's responsibility, evidence that any real damage occurred from the spillage
and
substantiation of costs claimed.
We take the opportunity to correct your statement that you have "used rates substantiated and agreed
between the
parties". We have no record of having agreed the manpower rates stated within your final claim.
Additionally, you
have provided no records to substantiate the hours and man power claimed or established that these
costs would be
considered additional.
Therefore, the Contractor is unable to determine any entitlement for t he event claimed.
Yours faithfully,
