Notice to Correct â€“ Non-Designation of a Project Manager

Dear Sir,
Further to our enclosed emails and other numerous correspondences, this is to officially put on record
that you have not been providing a full time Project Manager as per your Subcontract obligations.
It has been observed that during the regular working hours, there is no designated Project Manager on
site to act on your behalf as per Schedule 0 (Scope of Subcontract Works) Clause 4.2.12 A [General
Services & Builders Work] of the Subcontract. Please note that your mentioned failure is a general
breach of the Subcontract Agreement. Your failure to comply with the Conditions of the Subcontract is
unacceptable and you are strictly reminded to fully comply with your Subcontract obligations at all
times.
In view of the above, we hereby instruct you under Subcontract Clause 22.1 [Notice to Correct] to
immediately designate a Project Manager on site and take all necessary measures to prevent any similar
future events.

As noted in our enclosed email, in the event you are unable to provide a full time Project Manager, we
will take all necessary actions on your behalf and backcharge you accordingly.
This is for your immediate action.
Yours faithfully,
