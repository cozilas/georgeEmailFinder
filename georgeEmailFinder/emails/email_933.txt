Subject:

RE: Amendment Agreement No.3-For On Account Monthly Advance Payment

Dear Sir,
With reference to the above subject and in continuation to the above referenced correspondences, you
are hereby informed that our position regarding this matter remains as per the contents of our letter
referenced (3) above.
In regards to your comment about a potential dispute, we reiterate that the Subcontract Agreement is
clear as to the procedures in place which need to be adhered to and implemented prior to any issuance
of a Dispute Notice. Accordingly, you are required to give a notice (a Dispute Notice) of the dispute and
thereafter enter into discussions with us in an attempt to settle the dispute. In the event we could not
amicably settle the dispute we would be compelled to refer the matter to arbitration pursuant to Clause
27.3.2 [Dispute Resolution]. Note that arbitration is not an economic form of dispute resolution, in
which both Parties are incurring substantial legal and specialist fees.
We hope that the above clarifies our position in the matter.
Yours faithfully,
