Contractor believes that it may be entitled to extensions to the Time(s) for Completion pursuant to GC
8.4.1(a) as a result of the issuance of El Nr 92 and, (3) as the Contractor's "Claim" Notice for El Nr 92
pursuant to GC 20.1.2.

In accordance with GC 3.3.4, GC 8.4.4 and GC 20.1.6, the Contractor is required to provide the Engineer
