Subject: Non Payment of Sub-Subcontractor NAFFCO and Implementation of Clause 5.6 (Schedule 11Payment Terms)
Dear Sir,
We have been approached directly by your domestic Sub-Contractor NAFFCO {Fire Fighting Installation
Specialist)
pertaining to an outstanding debt of substantial monies associated with the provision of Fire Fighting
Installation
Services on the projec_t._
We have previously under cover of Letter Reference MTBITCAIPCEJVILI00372S dated 3rd August 2016
already
requested full Financial Disclosure regarding the status of Certificates and Outstanding and I or late
payments to
critical Supplier and I or Sub-Contractors in your Supply Chain of which you have under cover of Letter
Reference
MTBIPCEJVITCAJVILI02698 dated 6th September 2016 have refused to do. Our response in this matter
will be
issued under cover of separate Letter however the issue of NAFFCO and that of the delays to critical Fire
Fighting
Installations is that of an immediate problem.

Whilst this dispute I lack of payment has nothing to do with the TCAJV from a contractual perspective
per se, we
do have a duty of care with regards to Subcontractor payments to Sub-Subcontractors. In this instance
we would
make reference to Clause 21.3 of the Sub-Contract Agreement between us in that;
'Before issuing any interim Payment Certificate the Contractor and/or the Contractor may demand from
the
Subcontractor reasonable evidence that all previous amounts paid to the Subcontractor in respect of
costs claimed
by the Subcontractor as being due to Sub-Subcontractors and/or suppliers {less any retentions) have
been paid by
the Sub-Contractor. If the Contractor has not received such reasonable evidence within three (3) Days of
such
request, the Contractor may (at its sole discretion) either;
(a) Withhold such amounts (rom anv further pavment due to the Subcontractor; or
(b) Pay such amount (or any part of such amount) directly to the relevant Sub-Subcontractors and/or
suppliers on behalf of the Subcontractor and recover such amount (rom the Subcontractor by
deducting and settinq-of[such amount (rom future payment due to the Subcontractor.'
In light of the aforementioned complaint from your Specialist Sub-Contractor {NAFFCO) of whom such
works are
critical to the successful completion of Milestones and subsequently that of the distinct possibility of
levying of
LADS by the Employer for failure, we are left with no option but to exercise our rights in this matter and
you are
instructed without fail to release the following information without fail by COB 28th September 2016.
1 Application Details
2 Certification Details
3 Date Invoice Issued
4 Status of Payment Against Individual Certifications I Invoices
5 Date Payment Made and I or Due
6 Nr of Days Payment Late (In Accordance with Payment Terms betw In addition to that of Clause 21.3
(Payment to Sub-Subcontractors - Conditions of Subcontract) we would also make reference to that of
Clause 5.4.3 (Interim Payment - Schedule 11 Payment Terms) in that such certifications will be subject to
deductions if we believe you have failed to make payments to your supply chain. For ease of reference;
Clause 5.4- Schedule 11- Payment Terms
'When agreeing or determining the amount of the interim payment to which the Subcontractor is
entitled and issuing the Interim Payment Certificate, the Contractor shall deduct from the amount
claimed by the Subcontractor any items in the Statement with which the Contractor disagrees including
items which the Contractor (acting reasonably) believes relates to; Sub Clause- 5.4.3 'failure of the
Subcontractor to make payments properly to Sub-subcontractors, suppliers to pay for labour, Materials
or equipment or a failure to provide adequate evidence of the same to the Contractor ...... '
As stated above the nature of NAFFCO work on the project is critical to the successful completion of
numerous contractual milestones. In light of this, the Project Management Team (PMT) has agreed that
emergency mitigation measures are to be put in place to ensure that such critical works are not
impacted by your inability to adhere to Clause 5.4.3 (Schedule 11 - Payment Terms- See Above). As such
you are to take this letter as formal notification I notice of our intention to invoke that of Clause 5.6 of

Schedule 11 (Payment Terms) whereas;
'If the Subcontractor fails to make payment of any amount that is due to a Sub-subcontractor in
circumstances where the Contractor determines such non-payment was not the responsibility of such
Sub subcontractor, the Contractor may {but shall be under no obligation to) pay such Sub-subcontractor
directly, having given five (5) days' notice to the Subcontractor of its intention to do so. Any amount paid
to a Sub-subcontractor pursuant to this paragraph 5.6 shall be deemed (and identified) in total 1 & 3 (as
described in paragraphs 3.1.2 and 3.1.6) of any statements submitted by the Subcontractor to the
Contractor after the date of such payment. Any direct payment made by the Contractor is not intended
to create and shall not create any contractual relationship or other relationship whether reliance based
or otherwise between the Contractor and any Sub subcontractor.'
Our decision to implement the aforementioned is not one that was taken lightly. Our decision in this
matter will be proven to be the right one and that which will be completely vindicated. For the record
our decision in this matter does in no way release you of any of your contractual commitments on the
project nor does it also absolve you from the levying of any cost and or delays over and above that of
the payments made to your Subcontractor on your behalf. In summary we hold you completely culpable
for all cost and delays incurred associated with your decision and I or inability to service your supply
chain with such critical payments for materials, labour, plant and I or services provided by them on the
project.
Yours faithfully,
