Dear Sirs,
We refer to our Notice of Force Majeure issued by way of letter ref: (1) above.
It has since come to our attention that, as part of the precautionary measures adopted on the Abu Dhabi
Midfield Terminal Project, to reduce the possibility of transmission of the corona virus (COVID-19), that
all classroom and site training activities have been placed ‘on hold’ effective from 8 March 2020 until 5
April 2020. The attached e-mail from ADAC dated 8 March 2020 [2:48PM] (ref: 2) refers.
As noted in our letter ref: (1) we will continue to monitor and record events and provide you with
further details in the same manner as indicated above and attached hereto, as and when necessary.
Yours faithfully,
