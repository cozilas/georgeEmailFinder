Subject:MTB Delay Notification – Internal Glazing
Dear Sir
We refer to your letter ref: (1) which serves to issue us a ‘Delay Notification’ associated with purported
delays to completion of the Internal Glazing, which you further allege is impacting the Project
Completion.
For the reasons set out in Annex A hereto, which describes the events associated with the modifications
to the Internal Glazing [up to the date of receiving your letter ref: 1] and the late and / or unreasonable
Status Code 3 commented responses to RFI/0401/17654 and the other Document and Shop Drawing
submittals referenced therein, combined with the fact that the Time for Completion has been delayed
by a myriad of excusable delaying events detailed in the 5 post-SAA8 TIA submissions issued to date, we
disagree entirely.
We are confident that when, in due course, the appropriate extensions of time related to our TIAs (Post
SAA8) are granted by you, your comments regarding our failure to achieve Project Completion will have
been rendered academic and the matter will have been superseded by the revised Milestone dates.
We conclude by reiterating that we remain fully committed to ADAC, the Project and to completing our
obligations within the shortest possible time, without compromising on safety and quality, but will not
be held responsible for such factors as those outlined above for which we are not culpable.
Meanwhile, we reserve our rights under the provision of Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and
27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to the Time for
Completion and any associated costs arising from the late and / or unreasonable Status Code 3
commented responses to RFI/0401/17654 and the other Document and Shop Drawing submittals
referenced in Annex A hereto.
ANNEX A
DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT
Introduction
RFI/0401/17654
On 15 December 2019, we raised RFI/0401/17654 concerning the ‘Window Shift location at Hotel
Courtyard Façade’ all “as discussed and agreed with ADAC”, providing you with a Structural Design
Report for Window Support Frames’, together with a series of accompany sketches, requesting your
approval of the same; .
We requested a response by 26 December 2019. You failed to reply until 8 January 2020. Nevertheless,
we were advised by the Employer’s Design Consultant that this was a design change from IFC and is

rejected and with that in mind, informed the Employer therein, “to reject this proposal accordingly.” The
Employer on the other hand, advised it had no objection to our proposal, and directed us to ensure all
approvals were obtained from the relevant reviewers (Employer’s Design Consultant and HOE) for the
system performance.
We do note however that the Employer’s Fire and Life Safety Consultant (Profire) previously advised you
that an advance copy of the “updated drawings for windows are verified and found acceptable” (as per
their e-mail dated 24 December 2019, at 11:35 AM) and you in turn advised us that “window drawings
are cleared” as per their e-mail to you also dated 24 December 2019, but timed at 12:05 PM). [copies

The response contained the following comments:
The Employer’s Design Consultant advised that “This is a design change ... that is instructed and
approved by ADAC and not KPF ... We are providing our observations per ADAC instruction ...and note
that KPF has no design responsibility. Recommended code is Code 3. ADAC to review and provide final
code.”
The Employer said: “Code 3 as per to Consultant recommendation. Contractor to comply with
comments on submittal. [We] ... accepted Contractor’s proposal for the relocation of the window to
support ... the fire integrity rectification works .... Contractor takes full responsibility to achieve
...performance requirements.”
The comments on the submittal are reproduced in Figure 1 below:

Also on 19 January 2020, we submitted Shop Drawing Submittal No. SDS/0401/A/4840 Rev. 00, for
approval of Shop Drawing No. 401-JV-A-03-L_-5.32-DWL-SD-001 Rev. 00 ‘Fire Rated Window Details and
Hotel Courtyard Façade’ which you replied to on 26 February 2020 classifying it Status Code 3 (refer

Article 1.3 of Specification Section 013300 ‘Submittal Procedures’ governs the processing time by which
you are contractually obligated to respond to our Submittals. On the basis that SDS/0401/A/4840 is at
Rev. 00, then this ought to have been responded to by you 21 calendar days later, i.e. on 9 February
2020. However, the information recorded in Table 1 shows you exceeded the contract review period by
17 calendar days.
Our entitlement to an extension of time and to recover the associated costs resulting from this act of
prevention on your part and / or the part of the Employer’s Personnel/Consultants, will apply

irrespective of any alleged failure on our part [which is denied], to transmit submittals to you in a timely
manner.
Notwithstanding the delayed response, you advised you would follow the coding of the Employer’s Fire
and Life Safety Consultant (Profire); which had been returned classified as Status Code 3. However, it is
worth noting that no comments were in fact provided either on the Transmittal or the Shop Drawing
[subject to the response to SDS/0401/A/4840 Rev 00 issued on 26 February 2020]. This was recorded in
an exchange of e-mails between our respective Document Control Departments at the time (on 26
February 2020). [Jean – were the comments ever issued? Please advise and confirm how and what the
comments were] We were surprised by their rejection given their previous acceptance of the window
sketch drawings [see above].
DS/0401/L/15413 Rev. 00
Following which on 3 March 2020, we submitted Document Submittal No. DS/0401/L/15413 Rev. 00, for
approval of the revised ‘Structural Design Report for the Window Support Frames’; which you
responded to on 26 March 2020 classifying our submittal Status Code 3, in the manner shown in Table 3
below:

On 4 March 2020, we submitted Shop Drawing Submittal No. SDS/0401/A/4840 Rev. 01, for approval of
Shop Drawing No. 401-JV-A-03-L_-5.32-DWL-SD-001 Rev. 01 ‘Fire Rated Window Details and Hotel

4); the attached version of the Rev. 01 Shop Drawing containing multiple comments annotated
thereupon:

However, shortly thereafter, on 31 March 2020, were received your letter dated 26 March 2020 (ref:
MTC-CMA-TCA-0401-LTR-11461) associated with purported delays to completion of the Internal Glazing,
which you further allege is impacting the Project Completion. However for the reasons comprehensively
set out herein (i.e. the late and unreasonable status Code 3 commented responses to the various
submittals described above), plus the fact that the Time for Completion has been delayed by a myriad of
excusable delaying events detailed in the five post-SAA8 TIA submissions issued to date, we strongly
disagree.
We therefore maintain all our rights and entitlements under the provision of Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the events and circumstances described
above.
Yours faithfully,
