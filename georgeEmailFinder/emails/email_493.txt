Subject: Remedial works to subsided services
Dear Sirs,
We refer to inter alia, the above noted letters and acknowledge their contents as Instructions ofthe
Engineer issued under Conditions of Contract sub-clause 11.3.3 and confirm these Instructions
constitute Variations. Whilst we understand why you may be issuing letters in this way we must
record that you are fully aware that the Parties executed Settlement Agreement and Amendment
number 8 (SAA8) on the assurances that a supplemental agreement would be issued.
We are continuing to proceed with testing and analysis works on the basis that the putative
supplemental agreement causes Clause 5 of SAA8 to be deleted in its entirety and to be replaced
with wording that revises the risk profile in respect of these Works: this wording also requires that
the Engineer issues Instructions directing how the rectification works shall be carried out.
We would take this opportunity to record our extreme concern at the time it is taking for a design
solution to be found. It is becoming increasingly probable that the finally Instructed design solution
will require significant volumes of work to be carried out that may impact the operations of the
Airport. We would therefore urge you to conclude your design process as a matter of urgency so that
the revised IFC documents can be issued and remediation works commenced without further delay.
Yours faithfully
