Subject:Delay in Central Processor Cause and Effect Documents Submission
Dear Sir,
We refer to your letter (1) issued in reply to our letter (2) and your allegations of purported delays to the
Central Processor Cause and Effect Testing documents.
We disagree with the content of your letter (1) and have previously stated in our letters ref: (2) and ref:
(4) that, while we contend that we have submitted our various Submittals to you in a timely manner, the
delay to the Cause and Effect Testing [not just the preparation of the related documentation] is
attributable to a combination of:
(a)
Acts of prevention on your part as well as the part of others (i.e. Employer’s Design Consultant)
failing to respond to our Submittals within the review times expressly stated in the Contract; namely 21,
14 and 7 calendar days; and
(b)
The requirement for additional Fire Life Safety Devices [and related work] required by the House
of Expertise beyond what is reflected in the IFC Drawings.
The delays caused by you and others in failing to respond to our Submittals continues to be an on-going
problem; one that you are consistently failing to address, despite this being subject to numerous Delay
Notices. Our most recent notices dated E-Notice No. 176, dated 20 November 2019 and E-Notice No.
195, dated 15 January 2020, refer.
We disagree with your statement: ‘The Contractor has not evidenced any entitlement to any extension
to the Time for Completion…….’
Your statement is entirely misguided, and we remind you that to date, we have submitted the following
consolidated Delay Analyses:

1.
TIA No. 1 – Post SAA8, namely ‘Consolidated Delay Analysis for Events between 4 September
2018 and 1 May 2019’ submitted under cover of letter ref: (5); and
2.
TIA No. 2 – Post SAA8, namely ‘Consolidated Delay Analysis for Events between 2 May 2019 and
1 August 2019’ submitted under cover of letter ref: (6).
3.
TIA No. 3 – Post SAA8, namely ‘Consolidated Delay Analysis for Events between 2 August 2019
and 1 October 2019’ submitted under cover of letter ref: (7).
In TIA No. 1 – Post SAA8 we demonstrated entitlement of 158 calendar days extension to Milestone
MS09C; in TIA No. 2 – Post SAA8 we demonstrated a total of 320 calendar days’ extension to Milestone
MS09C, and finally in TIA No. 3 – Post SAA8 we also demonstrated a total of 320 calendar days’
extension to Milestone MS09C extending the date for completion from 31 October 2019 to 15
September 2020. – Post SAA8, which will be submitted to you shortly.
We are also in the process of completing TIA No. 4 – Post SAA8, which will be issued to you shortly.
The critical delays in all three (3) TIAs are largely due to delayed responses to Submittals; including inter
alia, the delayed responses to Fire Alarm and Fire Protection Shop Drawings which have a direct and
consequential impact on Cause and Effect Testing.
We also maintain that the requirement for additional Fire Life Safety Devices required by the House of
Expertise beyond what is shown in the IFC Drawings, and the associated work and the impact that this
has on our Submittals, also has a direct and consequential impact on Cause and Effect Testing. Our most
recent E-Notice; No. 190 [issued by way of letter ref: MTN/TCA/AECOM/L/015214] dated 14 January
2020, refers. To this end, and as mentioned in our previous letters on the subject, we reiterate that
entitlement to recover the time and cost here.
Yours faithfully,
