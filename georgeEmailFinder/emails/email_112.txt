Subject: Briefing Packs Neutral Document Record Sheets
Dear Sir,
Generated Between OS February 2018 to 07 March 2018
We enclose herewith revised Briefing Packs Sketches and CMIR as a record of the change management
workshops held between OS February 2018 to 07 March 2018 for your preparation of additional or
modified
drawings and specification and instruction necessary for the execution of the Works.
Kindly note that some of the signed document dates may vary from the cut-off date due to the time lag
between actual signatures and upload into shared file transfer protocol server.
For clarity and avoidance of doubt:
• The attached neutral sketches and other documents illustrate further development of, and potentially
additional changes than those provided in the original sketches as initially instructed by the Engineer's
Briefing Pack. For practical purposes and/or where ever practicable, the changes are identified by
clouding
the relevant parts ofthe neutral sketches.
• Other than reflecting the Employer's proposed Variation in relation to the current Contractor
coordination
of the Works, the Contractor's signature on the attached neutral documents does not imply any
warranty
or design responsibility with respect of the proposed Employer Variation.
• The Employer shall be responsible for ensuring that the participating Consultants have exercised the
necessary skill, care and judgement and are suitably qualified professionals who are competent to carry
out their assigned duties and are delegated the necessary authorities by the Engineer to act on behalf of
the Employer.
• The Employer retains the responsibility for the design, compliance with codes/applicable laws and the
relevant Governmental Authority approvals.
• The proposed Variation shall be deemed to be on hold pending the Engineer's instruction and
additional
or revised IFC Drawings to implement pursuant to the Variation provisions under the Contract.
• The neutral sketches or other documents are not Shop Drawings {or any other Contractor's
Document).
Such Contractor documents shall be developed pursuant a subsequent Engineer's instruction and
revised
IFC Drawings and/or specification. The Contractor's preparation of Shop Drawings shall be a sole
discretion of the Contractor.
Kindly issue a further instruction and revised drawings and/or specification for the implementation as a

confirmed Variation Order to minimize delays arising from the proposed Variations.
Thank you.
