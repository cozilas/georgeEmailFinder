Subjed: Response to the Engineer's letter- Arbitration No: DL18153 Cavotec Group Holdings
Vs PCEJV
Dear Sir,
Midfield Terminal Building - General Contractor
The Contractor writes in response to the Engineer's letter reference (1) above, whereby the Engineer
has
stated that the matter related to Cavotec Group Holdings is closed as the arbitration is between the

Mechanical Subcontractor ('PCEJV') and Cavotec Group Holdings ('Cavotec').
Whilst the Engineer's statement that the arbitration proceedings are between PCEJV and Cavotec may
be
technically correct, it is a simplistic and potentially misleading approach. In this regard the Contractor
rem inds the Engineer that the dispute between PCEJV and Cavotec has been caused by a comfuination
of
the Engineer' s Instruction No.35C, whereby the Engineer has instructed the Contractor to appoint
Guinault Lebrun Aircraft Power Systems LLC (GL) to implement the Pre-Conditioned Air (PCA) Sub-Freeze
Equipment works (after PCEJV had awarded a contract to Cavotec for this package of v- or.ks), and the
Engineer's subsequent refusal to admit Cavotec's claim for compensation.
The Contractor encloses the Mechanical Subcontractor's letter reference (2) above, whereby it has
rejected the Engineer's formal request to withdraw PCA RFV0-362-Part C.
In light of the above, the Contractor does not consider the matter related to Cavotec Group f!loldings is
closed. Furthermore, the Engineer is put on notice that should t he Contractor incur any losses in the
future (including, but not necessarily limited to, a claim from PCEJV in relation to its arbitration
proceedings with Cavotec) as a result of the Engineer's actions in relation to this matter,, then the
Contractor shall cla im al l such losses from the Employer.
The Contractor requests that the Engineer shall proceed pursuant to Sub-Clause 11.4 of the Conditions
of
Contract to agree or determine the adjustment to the Contract Price by reason of PCA RFV0-362-Part C.
Yours faithfully
