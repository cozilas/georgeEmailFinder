Subject:Notice of Delay – Failure to achieve commitment dates and a reasonable rate of progress
Dear Sir,
We write to express our significant concerns regarding the lack of site progress made to date, with
particular attention being drawn to the following areas/activities:
Glass Wall linings & Glass Screens - Piers 1,3 & 4
Gatehouses - Piers 1,3 & 4
Single Height Pavillions – All areas
Double Height Pavillions – Piers 3 & 4
Lifts – All areas

We record with concern that you have failed not only to comply with the commitment dates contained
within the Memorandum of Understanding (3), but also to implement the necessary mitigation
measures to ensure the recovery of progress is achieved against the aforementioned Subcontract
Works.
It is evident from the recent progress meetings that the most significant contributing factors concerning
the above delays relate to unskilled and insufficient manpower to coordinate the works between
departments such as Design, Procurement, Construction and Quality Control (QC). Following the
issuance of the Level One Programme (4), we jointly held reconciliation meetings on the 16th and 17th
October to determine programme and manpower requirements. These meetings highlighted significant
deficiencies in your organisation’s ability to understand the extent of the outstanding works and the
necessary resources required to achieve these dates.
Considering the above, you are duly notified, pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.4 [Recovery of Delays) of the
Conditions of Subcontract, that the progress of the Subcontract Works related to the abovementioned
activities is extremely inadequate in order to achieve the Subcontract Time for Completion (4). In light of
this, you are instructed to take all steps necessary to expedite the progress of the Subcontract Works
related to these areas and activities at no additional cost to the Contractor.
Furthermore, you are instructed to submit an ‘Action Plan’ with 7 days of receipt of this Notice. The plan
should advise us on your proposed mitigation measures that are required to be implemented by you, in
order to expedite the progress of these areas and activities. These measures will need to be
communicated and agreed with the TCAJV Construction and Commercial teams ahead of
implementation.
We reserve our rights to recover from you, pursuant to Sub-Clauses 10.3 [Contractor's Claim], 12.12
[Other Contractors and Other Subcontractors] and 16.6 [Delay Damages] of the Conditions of
Subcontract, all associated costs, losses, expenses and damages that may be incurred by us, due to your
abovementioned failure.

This is for your information and necessary action.
Yours faithfully,
