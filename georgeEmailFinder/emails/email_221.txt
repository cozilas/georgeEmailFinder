Subject Method Statement for Loose Soil Zone Permeation Grouting under Manholes and
Pipes
Dear Sir,
We refer to the Method Statement for Loose Soil Permeation Grouting to Existing Sewer Manhole and
Pipeline, Storm Water Pipeline and Other Utilities and note that this Method Statement was reviewed
and given Code 2 with comments (see attached). The Engineer has since followed up via email
correspondences {1) and {2) seeking the Contractor's resubmittal of the revised Method Statement
addressing the aforementioned comments. To date the Contractor has failed to resubmit and is
proceeding at risk with the subject works.
We once again request the Contractor to immediately address the provided comments and resubmit
the Method Statement and draw the Contractor's attention to adhere to the previously approved
methods of grouting during the recent trials unless alternative methods of grouting are approved by
the Engineer and meet the acceptance criteria prescribed in the Contract Specification.
Yours faithfully
