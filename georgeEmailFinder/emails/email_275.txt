Subject: Special Airport Systems Documentation Status Misreporting - Principles'
Dear Sir,
Meeting Contractor's Presentation (Slide no.23)
In response to your letter reference 1) above, whereby you highlight a number of discrepancies
reported within our presentation {Slide no.23) of the Principles Meeting dated 18 September 2019,
we would like to confirm the following:
In particular you have referenced certain Special Airport Systems documentation, which you assert
were either returned to the TCA JV without any delays, were never received from TCA JV, or were
received within a lesser period than reported by TCA JV. To eradicate any discrepancies on this
matter, we have double checked our records against each referenced document and can confirm the
following:
1. The Engineer confirmed that the following documents were replied too prior to the cut-off date
reflected in Slide no. 23 (i.e. before 18 September 2019):
• Spare Parts Video wall (ref: STE/0401/SS/0010): Rev02 was submitted to CMA on 23 June 2019
and returned back on 18 September 2019 ( Rev02 review cycle : 87 days ); the transmittal has
been returned as Code-2 without any further technical comments, so TCA JV requested receding
to Code-1 through an email sent on 21 September 2019. CMA issued code-1 on 27
October 2019;

• Spare Parts LRP (ref: 0401-Atlas-STE-MTB-SS-0007): Rev01 was submitted to CMA on 09 July
2019 and returned back on 18 September 2019 ( Rev01 review cycle : 71 days ); the transmittal
was returned as Code-2 without any further technical comments, so TCA JV requested receding
to Code-1 through email sent on 21-09-2019. CMA issued code-1 by on 20 October
2019.
• Spare Parts LAN (ref: 0401-Atlas-STE-MTB-SS-0010): Rev02 has been submitted to CMA on 10
July 2019 and returned back on 18 September 2019 (Rev 02 review cycle: 70 days);
• Spare Parts Intercom & Barrier & Maintenance Manual Lan (ref: MTB-ATLAS-TCAJV-T-01586)this
combined two different deliverables together; 1) Spare Parts Intercom & Barrier (MTBATLASTCAJV-T-02129) submitted to CMA on 22 July 2019 and returned back on 18 September
2019 ( Rev 0 review cycle : 58 days ). As the transmittal was returned as Code-2 without any
Subject:Engineer’s Notification of Delay to Milestone MS09C
Dear Sir,
We refer to your letter (1) above, which not only purports to serve as a Notice of Delay to Milestone
MS09C, but erroneously states that “to date, the Contractor has failed to evidence any entitlement to
additional time beyond 31 October 2019.”
We remind you that to date, we have submitted the following consolidated Delay Analyses:
1.
TIA No. 1 – Post SAA8, namely ‘Consolidated Delay Analysis for Events between 4 September
2018 and 1 May 2019’ submitted under cover of letter ref: (2); and
2.
TIA No. 2 – Post SAA8, namely ‘Consolidated Delay Analysis for Events between 2 May 2019 and
1 August 2019’ submitted under cover of letter ref: (3).
In TIA No. 1 – Post SAA8 we demonstrated entitlement of 158 calendar day extension to Milestone
MS09C; while in TIA No. 2 – Post SAA8 we demonstrated a total of 320 calendar days’ extension to
Milestone MS09C, extending the date for completion from 31 October 2019 to 15 September 2020.
We further record that at the date of letter ref: (1) you were not only in receipt of letter ref: (2) but had
also received letter ref: (3); therefore to say that we have failed to evidence any entitlement to
additional time beyond 31 October 2019 is grossly incorrect.
Moreover, we also wish to remind you that TIA No. 2 utilised a cut-off date of 1 August 2019. Since
then, not only do many of the delaying events analysed therein have a continuing effect on Milestone
MS09, but the grounds for entitlement to further extensions to Milestone MS09C are continuing also.
This is evidenced by the fact that since 1 August 2019, we have been compelled to raise a further 41
notices of delays. These have been raised as a consequence of various acts of prevention on the part of
the Employer, the Employer’s Personnel, the Consultants or Other Contractors, not to mention the
introduction of further changes to the Works ‘by stealth’ by the Employer’s Design Consultant via his
response to various RFIs. The detail contained in our notices is testament to this evidence of fact.
In view of the above, we reiterate that your purported Notice of Delay to Milestone MS09C is entirely
misguided and maintain that we are currently entitled to an extension to the Time for Completion of
Milestone MS09C of ‘at least’ 320 calendar days. Further TIAs will be submitted in due course.
We conclude by reiterating that we remain fully committed to ADAC, the Project and to completing our
obligations within the shortest possible time, without compromising on safety and quality, but will not
be held responsible for such factors as those outlined above for which we are not culpable.
Yours faithfully,
