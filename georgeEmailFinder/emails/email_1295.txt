Dear sir
Further to the issuance of our Contractor's Instruction Ref: Cl/000425 via Letter Reference
MTB/TCA/ANEL/L/002135 dated 13 December 2015, we hereby confirm our decision to cancel the
above
Instruction as RFI has been adopted as an alternative solution to supersede this Cl.
We hope the above clarifies our situation. Should you have queries, please do not hesitate to discuss
further.
Yours faithfully,
