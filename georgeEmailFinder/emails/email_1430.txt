Dear Sir,

The Engineer's Assistant acknowledges receipt of Contractor's letter referenced at 2) above.

The Engineer's Assistant does not require that the size of the shaft be altered to accommodate a
reduced cable provision as per letter reference 3) above. However, Contractor is referred to Engineer's
Assistant's letter, reference 1) above for your consideration and response.

Yours faithfully,
