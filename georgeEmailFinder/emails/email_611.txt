Subject: Contractor's Readiness for Rainy Season
Dear Sir,
The Contractor acknowledges receipt of letter reference (1) wherein the Engineer requests the
Contractor to
implement all necessary precautions in view of the coming rainy season. In this regard, the Contractor
confirms that it is fully prepared to effect the arrangements stipulated within its Wet Weather Plan;
moreover, some of these arrangements are already in place as shown in the attached pictures.
In relation to the Engineer's request that the Contractor suitably protects all excavations, please be
advised
that there are over 50 no. on-going excavations which cannot be covered due to their size. The
Contractor
confirms however that all necessary submersible suction pumps have been arranged for these locations.
The ConW1ctor trusts the above addresses the Engineer's worries. Nonetheless, should the Engineer
have any
further concerns vis-a-vis the Site readiness for a rain event, the Contractor confirms that its
construction and
logistics representatives remain available to discuss any such concern through the standard site
coordination
channels.
Yours faithfully
