Dear Sirs,

Further to the Contractor 's fully detailed initial interim Claim Nr 029 submission issued under cover of
reference 11 and, further to subsequent Claim Nr 029 monthly updates issued under cover of references
2, 5 and 8, the Contractor hereby provides its February 2016 monthly update of said Claim in accordance
with General Condition ("GC") 20.1.6(b) of Volume 3 of the Contract.

The quantum of the delay and the extension of time entitlement has not changed from the previous
January 2016 monthly update for Claim Nr 029 contained within the below table:

Completion Milestone Contract "Time for Completion" Impacted I Delayed "Time for Completion" Due
to Claim/Delay Event (Delay
Event ended upon effective date of 20.12.15) Delay (Calendar Days) - Extension of Time Entitlement
(Delay Event ended upon effective date of 20.12.15)

STATION SECTION :
(Design of) Station Al Rayyan South (Ref M006.YW.ST.RYS)

31.08.16 (STKID.DE)

24.01.17

146

Therefore, (as per the January 2016 Claim Nr 029 update) due to the Claim Event/Delay
Event/Suspension, the Contractor is currently entitled to an extension of 146 days to the Time for
Completion (Key Interface 1 (STKID. DE)) for the "(Design of) Station Al Rayyan South" (Refere nce
M006.YW.ST.RYS) Section of the Works , pursuant to GC 8.4.1(b) and GC 8.9.1(a) of Volume 3 of the
Contract and, pursuant to Article 172.1 (good faith) and Article 220 (unjust enrichment) of the Qatar
Civil Code (Law No 22 of 2004).

The Contractor confirms that no further costs information in relation to Claim Nr 029 has been received
by the Contractor over the past month. However, to date,the Contractor has received no payment from
the Employer with respect to Claim Nr 029. Accordingly, the Contractor provides this February 2016
Financial monthly update to Claim Nr 029 as follows.

As mentioned within the January 2016 monthly update, the Contractor received its Lead Designer's
claim FCN 115 with respect to the resumption of design to Al Rayyan Station. The sum taken to value
within the Contractor's Claim Nr 029 January 2016 monthly update with respect to FCN 115, is OAR
876,680 .00 plus the Contractor's overheads and profit ("OHP") addition of QAR 113,968.00 . Finance
costs are therefore due from the Contractor's receipt of FCN 115 on 21 January 2016:

(QAR 876,680.00 (50% of FCN 115 as per January 2016 update) + QAR 113,968.00 (OHP on last)) x 39
days (21 January 2016 to 29 February 2016)/365 days x 4.25% p.a. (Finance rate) = QAR 4,499.00.

OHP upon Finance costs = QAR 4,499.00 x 13% (OHP rate) = QAR 585.00 .

Therefore, total Finance Costs including OHP upon same = QAR 4,499.00 + QAR 585.00 = OAR 5,084.00

This provides a February 2016 updated Financial Summary for Claim 029 as follows:
