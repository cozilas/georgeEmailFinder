Responses to RFI/0401/17431 and RFI/0401/17440 – Additional Bollards to Level L1.0 BHS Area
& Suspension of Installations / Changes in Requirements – Request for Engineer’s Instruction (RFEI) /
Variation Order (VO)
Dear Sir
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and/or disruption to the Works and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
The responses to RFI Nos. 17341 and 17440 Annex A confirms the requirement for additional bollards
and represents a change in design and scope, while the Employer’s emails dated 1 and 7 October 2019,
order us to suspend bollard installations and requires further changes respectively. While the
suspension represents an act of prevention on the part of the Employer, any requisite change to the
design and scope requires a valid EI and VO in order for us to integrate the same into the Works.
Potential Impact
Any requirement for additional works, such as that outlined herein and at this stage of the Project, is
likely to impact on the achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within seven (7) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
On 29 July 2019, we raised RFI/0401/17341 Rev. 00 titled ‘FMR – Impact Protection for MEP Services in
L1.0 BHS Areas’ together with a series of attachments [consisting of layout plans and sketch drawings]
reflecting a series of eleven (11) ‘cases’ for “the additional impact protection required for the MEP
services in BHS area at L1.0 CSP” following a meeting held with ADAC on 25 July 2019.
Indicative examples extracted from some of the sketch drawings attached to RFI/0401/17341 Rev. 00,
showing the various changes in requirements are reproduced in Figure 1 and Figure 2 below.

We concluded RFI/0401/17341 Rev. 00 by requesting your confirmation of our understanding of the
Employer’s requirements for us to proceed with the same and to close out NCR Nos 1267 and 1310.
We received the response to RFI/0401/17341 Rev. 00 on 8 August 2019; which is two days later than
requested. However, rather than receive a considered response, properly addressing the matter, we
received the following reply from the Employer’s Design Consultant (refer to Figure 3 below):
Figure 3
The Employer’s response on the other hand, simply advised us to “update the drawing to represent
what was discussed on the 25th July, as what was presented in this RFI does not”, while you elected to
refer to the marked up ‘supporting documents’ attached thereto; with your commented responses
annotated in yellow; indicative extracts of which are reproduced in Figure 4 and Figure 5 below:
Figure 3
Figure 4
In our view, the sketch drawings attached to RFI/0401/17341 Rev. 00 adequately represented what was
discussed at the meeting held on 25 July 2019, and served to reflect changes in the Employer’s
requirements; especially considering that the sketches record “additional bollard to be provided”,
“egress route to be adjusted”, and “crash barrier to be replaced with bollards” plus “bollards to be
provided in front of the crash barrier”; and cannot be deemed to be “deviations” or are required to
remedy “defects” as erroneously alleged by the Employer’s Design Consultant. It is however patently
clear that the further comments annotated upon the sketches attached to the collective response to
RFI/0401/17341 Rev. 00 have served to vary the Employer’s requirements even further. For example, “If
possible put 4 x bollards around column...” and “…the bollards will likely be in the sweeping pathway of
the dolly tugs and trains, therefore it is best to relocate the cabinets to the inside
Further to the above, on 8 September 2019 we raised RFI/0401/17440 Rev. 00 and with reference to the
Employer’s Design Consultant’s comments for cases 6, 7 and 8 (where we were advised to relocate the
cabinets located in the BHS dolly pathways in lieu of providing bollards), we attached thereto a series of
further sketches reflecting this change in requirements (refer to Figure 5 below):
Figure 5
We received your response to RFI/0401/17440 Rev. 00 on 12 September 2019. However, once again the
Employer’s Design Consultant saw fit to repeat many of the same comments was were issued in reply to
RFI/0401/17341 Rev. 00, but for the avoidance of doubt is reproduced in Figure 6 as follows:
Figure 6
We again reiterate that the sketch details attached to RFI/0401/17440 Rev. 00 cannot possibly be
deemed to be “deviations” or reflect changes required to remedy “defects”; and moreover are not
Contractor proposals per se, but represent our interpretation of recommended changes proposed by
you in the response to RFI/0401/17341 Rev. 00. We note however that you failed to provide any
comments in response to our RFI; the Employer on the other hand, advised it had “no objection to the
relocation of the fire valve cabinets as confirmed by AHJ … and ADAC Operations …”
Following the various workshop meetings held between our MEP team and you, the AHJ and ADAC, and
having coordinated matters between us and ADAC Operations to agree on the extent of bollards
required and their locations and having issued the above RFIs in confirmation of the same, we then
continued to engage with our BHS subcontractor, CRISPLANT, to supply and install the bollards.
However, having done so, we received an e-mail from ADAC on 1 October 2019 [1:06 PM] ordering us to
“stop the installation of the extra BHS bollards until we conduct a joint walk with BHS ops and Etihad on
Thursday morning”. The reason put forward for this suspension of works was because “I just don’t want
them installed in a place that isn’t as effective as the OPS team think it should be.”

Notwithstanding the fact the Employer has otherwise acknowledged that the additional bollards are
exactly that, additional, it is clear that the Employer has stopped the bollard installations due to them
‘changing their mind’ as to the locations of the bollards as well as the associated or related works.
This was subsequently confirmed to be the case by virtue of the Employer’s further e-mail dated 7
October 2019 [09:31 AM] which make reference to further changes in scope of works as follows:
•
1 x relocation of a VESA system (shown on last clash report)
•
1 x relocation of a isolator on column(shown on last clash report)
•
1 x cutting a concrete plinth.
•
2 x additional protection that was not on the original clash drawing
•
1 x additional concrete plinth extension with relocated existing steel barrier
•
1 x request to protect or relocate switch on electrical panel, CMA to confirm
Attached to the Employer’s e-mail were a series of “self-explanatory photos of areas where the [above
types of comments were made”; examples of which are shown in Figure 7 to Figure … below:

In summary therefore, it is clear that the responses to RFI/0401/17341 and RFI/0401/17440 confirms
the requirement for additional bollards requested by the Employer and represents a change in design
and changes to our scope of Works. The Employer’s subsequent e-mails dated 1 and 7 October 2019 on
the other hand, orders us to suspend bollard installations and requires further changes. While the
suspension represents an act of prevention on the part of the Employer, any requisite change to the
design and scope requires a valid EI and VO in order for us to integrate the same into the Works.
We remind you of the provisions of Clause 2.29 to Clause 2.31 of SAA8 pertaining to Variations, in so far
as we are not to proceed with any Variation until a VO and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. It
is your obligation to issue this Time/Cost Record first if you wish to instigate change; but this is only after
the additional time and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.
Meanwhile, until such time as you take the action required of you in accordance with SAA8 Clause 2.29,
we are unable to proceed with implementing the changes noted herein. We trust this is clear.
Yours faithfully,
