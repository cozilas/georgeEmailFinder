Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer's Assistant's letter at reference 1, the Contractor confirms that as per the
Contract requirements contained within the Employers Requirements - General (Volume 4), Sub-Clause
12.13.2, the Contractor shall provide samples and mock-ups, as required by the Engineer for the
Employer's acceptance, at least 28 days prior to the construction or fabrication of the part of work
under the Contact to which they are related. The Contractor shall propose a schedule of such at
completion of the design.

Further the Contractor would note that the above would be subject to the receipt of the Engineer's
Instruction upon the expenditure of the relevant Architectural Finishes Provisional Sums in accordance
with Sub-Clause
13.7.1 of the General Conditions of Contract (Volume 3).

Notwithstanding the above, the Contractor will present a proposed strategy for Mock Ups which if
implemented will provide the Employer with enough information to select materials for the front of
house Architectural Finishes. The proposed strategy which will be issued on the 22 March 2015 will look
to minimize the impact on the Contractors Programme and the Cost to Qatar Rail. This proposed
strategy can be used to initiate dialogue on the matter.

Yours faithfully,
