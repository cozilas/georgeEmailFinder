Subject:Post SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0159
Security System (Security Access Control and Video Surveillance System) – Snagging, De-snagging and
Defects Management
Unreasonable Snagging and De-Snagging Comments Uploaded to ZUTEC
Dear Sirs,
We refer to your letter ref: (1) following issuance of E-Notice No. 0159 (ref: 2) in which you seemingly
infer that we are somehow culpable for the matters detailed within our letter ref: (2), and that the
“delays due to the unreasonable snagging and de-snagging comments is deemed to have no merit
For the reasons comprehensively set out in Annex A to letter (2) we disagree; and it is clearly evident
you have elected to ignore the content of our notice and/or missed the crux of the issue entirely.
The facts are as follows: At the date of preparing our E-Notice, there were circa 5,560 snags uploaded to
the ZUTEC system relating to the Security Systems, out of which you erroneously identified 750 ‘snags’
allegedly relating to the SACS & VSS in rooms that do not have any elements installed in them. Hence we
were forced to unnecessarily close out a ‘snag’ that in reality did not exist. Moreover, our ability to
close out snagging has been further hindered by numerous unnecessary duplicated items being
uploaded to ZUTEC, which for example consists of the same Security System element installed at the
same location, which despite being identical were uploaded with a different reference number. These
acts of prevention were entirely avoidable but have both delayed disrupted our progress.

In view of this, then we maintain all our rights under the provision of Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses
16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to the Time
for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event described in letter ref: (2).
Yours faithfully,
