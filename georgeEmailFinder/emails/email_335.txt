and requires a valid EI and VO in order for us to integrate the same into the Works.
Potential Impact
Delay and disruption due to the events and circumstances outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
likely to impact on the achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to

Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within seven (7) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
On 1 July 2019 we raised RFI/0401/17253 Rev. 00 (ref: 1), concerning certain ambiguities between the
IFC Design Information (IFC Drawings and Door Schedule) relating to the ‘P2-P3 Level +33.75 Fan Room
Doors’, and specifically whether the 2 Nos. Fan Room Doors (Door Tag Nos. 0353.03 and 0.367.03) were
required or not. Specifically, we requested clarification in relation to the following:
1.
Door 0353.03 (located in Pier 2 Fan Room) was shown in IFC MTC-A-92-TB-L- 00.504.00 but it
was shown to be deleted in the Door Schedule Rev 31. In addition to this we informed you that the same
door is required according to IFC MTC-G-04-TB-L3.0-2.51-00.368 and MTC-G-04-TB-L3.0-3.51-00.370 to
comply with the fire compartmentation requirements.
2.
Door 0.367.03 (located in Pier 3 Fan Room) was not shown in the Door Schedule Rev 31 or in the
IFC Drawings, and accordingly we requested that you to clarify whether the noted door is required or
not and if it is required, whether it requires security access control (SACS).
3.
In addition, we also requested that you issue the updated IFC Design Drawings for security
(inclusive of access control schedule), the Government Structure Cable Network (SCN) and power
required for the access control panels, reflecting the Employer’s varied requirements.
We requested a response to RFI/0401/17253 by 7 July 2019. In the event however, you failed to reply
for a further 18 calendar days, i.e. on 25 July 2019. Added to which you advised that “The door shown in
the RFI attachment is from L3.1 and not L3.0” and confirmed that:
1.
Door 0353.03 is located in L3.1 Pier 2;
2.
Door 0367.03 is located in L3.1 Pier 3; and
3.
Both doors require SACS 2A;
You also advised us the “Contractor is responsible to ensure that access control are fully coordinated
with all other trades. Technical clarification and site coordination / No additional time/cost”.

Moreover, appended to your response were a series of six attachments enumerated as ‘ASK 4092 (RFI0401-17253)’ [sheet 01-03] [Architectural Details] and ‘YSK-398 (RFI-0401-17253)’ [sheet 01-03];
[Security / Access Control System Details] consisting of:
1.
Four (3) marked up / clouded sketches / IFC Drawings; and
2.
Two (2) extracts of a revised Door Schedule.
It is patently clear however that the attachments to response to RFI/0401/17253 represent a change in
design and scope given that they collectively (1) confirm changes to Door ‘0353.03’ and (2) confirm the
requirement door ‘0367.03’. However, given that SAA8 laid down strict guidelines to follow if additional
works are required and you appear to have ignored those obligations, then this change will warrant a
valid Engineer’s Instruction (EI) and a Variation Order (VO) if you require us to proceed with integrating
the revised scope into the Works.
We remind you of the provisions of Clause 2.29 to Clause 2.31 of SAA8 pertaining to Variations, in so far
as we are not to proceed with any Variation until a VO and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. It
is your obligation to issue this Time/Cost Record first if you wish to instigate change; but this is only after
the additional time and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.
Yours faithfully,
