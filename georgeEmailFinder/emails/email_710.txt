Dear Sir,
We are in receipt of your letter referenced (1) above in which you are alleging that you have been
unable to progress elements of your work due to significant outstanding preceding works by others.
Please be informed that we refute your statement and inform you that there are enough available workfronts for you to proceed but you are failing to do so, due to lack/shortage of resources (i.e. lack of
manpower). The available work-front areas include but not limited to the following:

•
•
•

baggage reclaim carousel cladding has been ready and available to proceed;
CP booths at L1.0 has been ready and is an open work-front;
camera posts at L1.0 is an open work-front.

Therefore, you are requested to take appropriate action and proceed immediately with the works as
stated above. We trust the aforementioned information and instruction are self-explanatory and you
will carry out the necessary actions as a matter of urgency.
Also, you are requested to coordinate your works in a proper sequence by means of continuous
communication with our construction team and other Subcontractors, to ensure the timely
commencement and completion of the works.
We always remain available to assist you by all possible means to progress in all areas satisfactorily and
ensure that the target programme dates are met throughout the project. As mentioned above, this can
only be done with your cooperation and adequate communication.
We trust you find the aforementioned self-explanatory and clarifies the matter.
This is for your information and further immediate action.
Yours faithfully,
