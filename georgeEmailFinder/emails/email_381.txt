Subject:Clause 27.1.1: Notice of Claim – Delay Notice No. 0109 [post-SAA8]
Road Closure to GSE road on 30 June 2019
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to the captioned matter and the delays to our Works due to the security
control measures at GSE road, instructed and implemented by the Employer via email ref: (1).
Specifically, on 27 June 2019, we received the Employer’s email ref: (1) informing us that security
control measures to GSE road will be effected for a day:
“GSE road starting from GH 45 until the tunnel entrance (as shown in the sketch below) is going to be
closed for traffic effective from 30th June, 2019 0600 hrs until 1800 hrs. Access will be granted only for
authorized personnel / vehicles and security / emergency services”.
In view of the above, we stress that most of our main works are concentrated in this area, and the GSE
road closure is directly impacting our ability to carry out our Works, such as but not necessarily limited
to, denying us access to the Works and/or delivering and/or removing goods, materials etc.
Accordingly, we contend that the GSE road closure, constitutes an act of prevention on the part of the
Employer, on the basis that it is preventing us from completing our Works, which will impact upon our
ability to achieve Milestones MS09B and may impact MS09C (Substantial Completion).
We therefore notify you pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 that the
events and circumstances detailed above constitute acts of prevention and/or breaches of Contract on
the part of the Employer and accordingly gives rise to our right to claim:
(i)
An extension to the Time for Completion pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c); and
(ii)
Damages for breach of contract.
Interim and/or final details of the Time Impacts and adjustments to the Contract Price relating to this
event will be provided in due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.5(a), (b) and (c).
Yours faithfully,
