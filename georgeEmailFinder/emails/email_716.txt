Subject: Reply Letter: Notice of Cost Impact Due to the Increase in Composite Cladding to
Columns
Dear Sir,
We acknowledge receipt of your notice vide your letter referenced in (3) above and we respond as
follows:
We remind you that your subcontract is lump sum not re-measurable and it was your sole responsibility
to find out the total required quantity of these column claddings and include their price within your
submitted BOQ during tender. Therefore you were already aware that this written quantity does not
have any basis since it is just indicative. Tenderers were expected to price this package after
interrogating all the requirements.
Please refer to the attached IFC rev.00 and rev.03 key plan drawings which indicates the scope of
cladding columns, rough locations and required types. As you can see the quantities provided in both
pages have not changed at all and CP area column claddings have always been part of your scope.
Therefore, we hereby reject your notice entirely and please refrain from making such baseless claims in
future.
This is for your information and record.
Yours faithfully,
