Reply – Notice on RFI Responses

Dear Sir,
We acknowledge receipt of your letter referenced in (3) above regarding the aforementioned subject.
However, the RFIs in question are still awaiting the Engineer’s response which normally takes 21 days
after the submission date (not to mention the Contractor’s internal review period prior to submission to
the Engineer).
Please be advised that the Contractor is taking his proactive action in order to have these RFIs
responded expeditiously to avoid further delay.
Yours faithfully,
