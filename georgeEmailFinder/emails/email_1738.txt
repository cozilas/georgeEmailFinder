Dear Sir,
This is a direction under Sub-Clause 13.2.1 for the Contractor to submit a quotation (both as to price and
any possible time impact) for the Variation proposed by the Engineer, namely the deletion of the Diesel
Generators in Stations and Tunnel Power Supply Substations .

The proposed variation allows for Diesel Generators to be deleted from metro stations as Qatar Rrail's
multiple redundancies in tne power supply system are by means of two Station Power Supply
Substations (SPS) at either site of a metro station. At this level there is 100% SPS redundancy . If SPS 1
fails, SPS 2

can provide the full load. The room allocation for Diesel Generators (70m2

is to remain for Systems use.

The room allocation for Diesel Tanks (30m2) can be deleted, providing the overall space requirements
for the stations are met.
The Contractor shall submit the quotation within 14 days of this direction. Yours faithfully,
