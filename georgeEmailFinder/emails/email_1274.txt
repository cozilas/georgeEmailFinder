yet to receive these Variation Orders from the Engineer.
Furthermore, in line with the latest discussions and correspondences we had with the Engineer on the
issue, the exchange rate for these RFVO submissions has been assessed at 4.30 AED/â‚¬ by the Engineer.
For convenience, please see enclosed schedule of exchange rates vs. the dates of the instructions and
RFVO Submissions received from the Engineer.
Finally, please be informed that without prejudice to your rights under the Subcontract Agreement, the

In addition, in case anything changes from the above, it will be reflected on the Variation Order.
This is for your information.
