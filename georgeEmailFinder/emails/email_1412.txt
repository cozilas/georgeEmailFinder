Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to its Variation/Claim Notice which was issued under cover of reference 3 with
respect to Engineer's Instruction No.12 (at reference 4). This Notice was required to be issued within 14
days of the Contractor's receipt of the Engineer's Instruction pursuant to General Conditions 3.3.3, 8.4.2,
and 20.1.2 of the Contract if the Contractor was of the view that the said Instruction may constitute a
Variation and involve a Contractor's entitlement to adjustment of the Contract Price and/or extension of
the Time for Completion.

Having now undertaken the necessary investigations, the Contractor is of the view that the said
Instruction does not currently involve any additional time and/or cost. Accordingly, the Contractor has
therefore now decided to withdraw its aforementioned Variation/Claim Notice issued under cover of
reference 3.

Yours faithfully,
