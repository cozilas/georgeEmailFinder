Subject: Delay Notice No. 1013 - Engineer's Failure to Instruct IFC Drawings for the
Dear Sir
Common Use Self Service Kiosk Cameras and Data Points
On 25 September 2017, the Contractor issued a Variation Order Request, under the cover of letter ref:
MTBITCAIAECOMILI11561, dated 24 September 2017. In reference to the Employer's Design
Consultant's
response to RFI/0401115005 on 13 September 2017, the Contractor averred that the "the information,
comments, clarifications and/or instruction contained therein constitute a Variation". Although the
response to RFI/0401115005 proposed additional cameras, data points and switch ports in the Common
Use Self Service (CUSS) kiosks, the Engineer has yet to incorporate the changes into IFC Drawings and
instruct pursuant to CC-C 20.1.1(a).
In relation thereto, the Contractor records that to date, the design information still remains outstanding.
Therefore, the Engineer is urged to issue the revised design and accompanying Instruction to allow the
CUSS works to progress.
The Contractor contends that the Engineer's I Employer's Design Consultant's continued failure to
address
this matter constitutes a breach of Contract or an act of prevention on the part of the Employer's
Personnel. Therefore, in accordance with Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1, the
Contractor hereby notifies the Engineer of its entitlement to claim:
(i) An extension of the Time for Completion of the Works pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c); and
(ii) An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.2 pursuant to Clause 9.10, or, in
the alternative, damages for breach of Contract.
Interim and I or final details of the Time impacts and adjustment to the Contract Price, will be provided
in
due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.5(a), (b) and (c).
Yours faithfully,
