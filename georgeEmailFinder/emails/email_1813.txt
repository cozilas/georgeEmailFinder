Dear Sir,

The Contractor is in receipt of letter reference 1) the content of which is hereby contested, in particular,
that the abortive MEP design costs in relation to the issue of the Tender Bulletin 1507/1 and to all other
Instructions of Appendix K are deemed to be included in the agreed lump sum price of Engineer’s
Instruction No. 138.

It is hereby noted that the “Header to: Appendix D” document which is now invoked in support of the
contrary (i.e. that the Contractor has waived its rights to recover abortive design costs) was drafted and
subsequently included within EI No. 138 by the Engineer’s Assistant and not the Contractor.

The inclusion of the said document is the cause of contradiction in terms with the content of Appendices
B (Scope of Works) and K (Basis of Offer) and not vice-versa and hence, the Contractor hereby reserves
its rights to recover the abortive design costs in relation to the Instructions of Appendix D of EI No. 138.

Yours faithfully,
