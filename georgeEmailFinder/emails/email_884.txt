Subject Snagging de-snagging Through Zutec
Dear Sir,
In response to your letter (1), the three week Zutec trial for snagging and de-snagging was concluded
on 07 April 2018, after which the hard copy formats that were running in parallel to Zutec were to be
discontinued. Zutec has been officially operational as the single system for recording
snagging/desnagging
starting 08 April 2018.
Whilst you previously supplied the room areas details to enable Zutec be setup for snagging and
desnagging,
it recently transpired that some building area information was missing and this requires your
action and update. You are currently identifying these areas and in the interim, snag/de-snag hard
copies have been accepted and processed by the Engineer to avoid any delays.
You provided details for the missing areas in Piers 1 and 2 Gatehouses entrance walls and cladding
which has now been uploaded to Zutec. Please review the rest of the Piers and the CP for any other
areas and systems omitted from Zutec and provide your updates as required to ensure the Zutec
system is fully updated and useable for snagging and de-snagging.
Yours faithfully,
