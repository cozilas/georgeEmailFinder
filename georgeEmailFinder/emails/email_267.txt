Subject: Substantiation of Contractor's Mark-Up for Variations
Dear Sir,
We refer to your above referenced letter and would respond as follows. Firstly we would remind you
that the only Overhead & Profit {OH&P) percentage (%) included in the executed Contract documents is

the 7% shown for the Defined Provisional Sum (DPS) included in Bill No.4 of Schedule 6 (Bills of
Quantities).
We note that you maintain your opinion that based upon your data and knowledge that the applicable
OH&P percentage for the measured works included in your Contract Price is 11.11%, however, we would
advise that there is nothing in Contract documents that supports this position.
In respect of your breakdown of the Contract Price, as required under Clause 21.6 of the Conditions of
Contract, we would comment that this was prepared after the Contract award consequently the figure
of 11.11% may be considered as subjective, therefore we require conclusive evidence from you or a firm
declaration from EY that the mark-up of 11.11% was actually incorporated into your Contract Price at
tender stage. Regarding EY's letter dated 10 March 2014 attached to your above referenced letter, we
would comment as below:
a) Within item 1 EY imply that the Form was prepared by the Joint Venture's management:
"The Form, which has been signed by ourselves solely for identification purposes and attached as
Appendix I, is the responsibility of the management of the Joint Venture" this indicates that the
information was extracted from the budget of the Abu Dhabi Midfield Terminal Building Project by the
JV Management. Therefore the "Schedule of Mark Up Calculation" is simply prepared by using the total
of the General Summary page of Schedule 6 (AED 10,805,822,731) exclude the sums for Provisional
Sums, the PS mark up and the dayworks equating to AED 9,784,499,462 and then dividing by the sum of
AED 8,796,567,171 (the total direct and indirect costs) resulting in a mark-up of 11.23%. b) Paragraph 2
on the second page states:
"Because the above procedures do not constitute either an audit or a review made in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing or International Standard on Review Engagements, we do not
express any assurance on the Form" This could be interpreted that EY are unable to confirm that the
figures stated on the Form (Appendix I to the letter) are correct. Furthermore paragraph 3, page 2,
states that had they performed an audit or review in accordance with the International Standards on
Auditing or International Standard on Review Engagements then "other matters might have come to our
attention that would have been reported to you"
In conclusion, until firm evidence is produced by yourselves or EY provide a clear statement that 11.11%
is the true and correct mark up incorporated within your Contract Price then we maintain our opinion
that a 7% allowance for 0 / H&P be used in the evaluation of variations.
Yours faithfully,
