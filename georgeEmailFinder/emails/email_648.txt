Subject:SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26, E-Notice No. – E0028 – Overdue MEP RFI Responses
Reference:
1. Schedule Attached
Dear Sir,
We write in connection with the above mentioned subject and notify you pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of
the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 that this event may cause delay to the Works and
therefore we seek your swift resolution to avoid any future disruption or delay pertaining to this matter.
The Contractor is providing the Engineer on a weekly basis a list of the MEP RFIs for which the responses
are pending with the Engineer. The RFIs are categorized based on their pending duration and priority. As
can be seen from the attached lists that were provided to the Engineer in the past, many of the RFI
responses were received by the Contractor after their due date and some others were received after a
period of over two months. This in turn is preventing the Contractor from proceeding with the related
works to meet the associated deadlines/milestones.
Your further guidance, decision and/or instruction is required by no later than 07 November 2018 to
proceed at the very latest; failing which the Works are likely to be delayed and/or disrupted.
We reserve our rights under the Contract pursuant to Sub-Clause 27.1 (Contractor’s Claims) to an
extension to the Time for Completion and additional Costs arising from the above described event.
Yours faithfully,
