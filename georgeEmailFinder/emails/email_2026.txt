Dear Sir,
Engineer's Assistant refers to the Engineer's Instruction referenced above, wherein the Contractor was
directed to submit a quotation for any cost and time impact. The Contractor's response was due by 31
May 2016, but to date the Contractor has not responded.

Contractor's delay in providing the quotation is preventing the Engineer from proceeding with the
'Valuation of Variation' in accordance with the Sub-Clause 13.6.

The Cont actor is directed to provide the quotation without any further delay.

Yours faithfully,
