Dear Sir,

Reference is made to the Engineerâ€™s letter item 1) regarding the request to submit a revised proposal for
the RFC item 2).

The contractor acknowledges that the aforementioned RFC is now terminated on Aconex. The issue of
accessibility maintainability of the tunnel ventilation rooms is the subject of ongoing interface and
coordination with the Railway systems Contractors. The requested benefits, if any, to the employer will
be dealt with upon final resolution of all interface issues.

The Contractor trusts that this clarifies the current situation.

Yours faithfully,
