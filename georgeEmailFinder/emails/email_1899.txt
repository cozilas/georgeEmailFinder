Dear Sir,

The Engineer's Assistant (EA) is in receipt of the Contractor's letter reference 2). The EA considers the
statements within paragraph 2) and 3) of the aforementioned letter reference 2) as incorrect where the
Contractor's reference to the rejected ICD is not acceptable. The EA requires the Contractor to follow
the Engineer's Instruction 51 letter reference 3) for aligning the scope of works.
Referring to Contractor's classifications ·o·to '4', as stated in the letter reference 2), the EA also requires
the Contractor to derive simila r classification for the Tables 1) & 2) of the above Engineer's direction.
Which would then be assessed and considered whether any additional information can be obtained
from the MSI Contractor for the Contractor's pricing the scope.

Furthermore, with reference to table 3) of the above Engineer's direction and the required cost
breakdown for items already under Contractor's scope of work, the Contractor's statement that it is
within the MEP self- perform BOO, is not acceptable. The EA requires the cost breakdown as per the
above Engineer's Direction without fail.

In this circumstance, the Contractor's request to revise the Engineer's direction is not granted, whereas
the Contractors' effort to list the aforementioned classifications to the tables 1) & 2) could have been
helpful to the Contractor in obtaining the required information.

This is a reminder for the Contractor to provide the required quotation. The Contractor's delay in
providing the quotation is preventing the Engineer from making an informed decision under the SubClause 13.2.3.

Contractor is fo take immediately action to provide the quotation within a reasonable time and the
Contractor is required to inform the EA of the anticipated date of submission within three (3) days.
Yours faithfully,
