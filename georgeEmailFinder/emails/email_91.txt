Following which, we received your response on 18 March 2020, which contained what we contend are a
series of unreasonable comments, despite the Actuator Butterfly Valve to MS/0401/L/0157 Rev. 01,
being compliant. The information recorded in the snapshot shown below indicates your resultant Status
Code 4 (Rejected) comments annotated thereupon (Figure 1 refers).
Figure 1
The information recorded in Table 2 below, records the particular comments in question, alongside we
have provided a response justifying why we believe those comments are unreasonable.

“No samples provided in this submission. Contractor to comply [with] Div. 01 spec
requirement” Please note that the requirements provided as per Division-01 of the Specification are
overall general and not specific.

In addition, no sample is required to be submitted with the valve specification. Nevertheless, you have
also confirmed the same via your email received on 2 September 2019 [Monday 1:46 PM] attached to
Annex B hereto, wherein you stated that:
“The contractor can proceed with the technical submission and submit the sample at a later stage when
made available. At least 1 sample need to be provided and kept for record if the MS attains Code 2”.

“Why material description changed Code -4” After numerous discussions with you / ADAC,
we have agreed that MS/0401/L/0157-Rev. 01 would be resubmitted to obtain the approval for the
actuator only (valves have been approved previously).
This has been confirmed by us via our email sent to you on 9 March 20 [Monday 6:07 PM] attached to
Annex C hereto, wherein we have confirmed our oral agreement stating that:
“Further to our discussion and agreement we have resubmitted only the actuator for motorized butter
fly valve with following ref no [MS/0401/L/0157 Rev.01] , kindly inform with your team to review and
approved accordingly”.
In addition to the above, it is worth noting that the proposed brand referenced in MS/0401/L/0157 Rev.
01, of the electrical actuated butterfly valves to be installed on the feeding water lines to the external
water tanks in Pump houses C and D, is manufactured by M/S Oventrop. We put on record that the
same product has been approved for other applications in the Project.
In view of the foregoing, we hereby inform you that your unreasonable Status Code 4 comments issued
in response to MS/0401/L/0157-Rev. 01, particularly at this stage of the Project will invariably delay
procurement and installation of the Actuator Butterfly Valves. This will consequently delay the testing
and commission and associated inspections of these materials, and may delay the Time for Completion.
Accordingly, we urge you to consider re-coding MS/0401/L/0157 Rev. 01 by return in order to avoid any
further unnecessary delays. Please note that any delays incurred to date and/or which may be incurred
by us as a result of your unnecessarily coding the noted material submittal Status Code 4, shall be at
your risk.
Yours faithfully,
