Subject: Notice of Force Majeure â€“ convid 19 (coronavirus)
Dear Sirs
We refer to the developing situation in respect of the unavoidable and exceptional event beyond our
control that is the outbreak at epidemic level of the coronavirus convid-19.
We have been notified of the closure of various manufacturing facilities, particularly in china but
progressively in other manufacturing countries from where various materials and components have
been sourced for this project: this is already impacting deliveries and is likely to get progressively worse
unless and until the epidemic becomes controlled or subsides.
We are also expecting an impact on labour and supervisory resources, both on and off site, as it is
expected that restrictions on movement may be imposed by Government action and that voluntary
isolation measured may begin to take effect.
As you will know this extremely serious situation is developing on a daily basis, with its impact on this
project being almost impossible to predict at this stage. We will monitor and record all events and will
keep you informed as the matter develops.
Yours Faithfully.
