Dear Sirs,

Further to the Contractor's fully detailed interim combined Claim Nr 25 & 26 submission (reference 13)
and the Contractor's subsequent monthly updates via references 4, 6 and 10, the Contractor now
confirms, in accordance with General Condition ("GC") 20.1.6(b) of Volume 3 of the Contract, the
following updated costs information have been collated by the Contractor to 30 April 2016 in relation to
the provision of the Architectural Finishes Front-of-House Mock-Ups (the Claim Event).

Subcontract, Purchase and Hire Orders:

Over the past month the Contractor has placed more Subcontract, Purchase and Hire Orders in relation
to the Mock-Up works. The Contractor therefore attaches to this letter a copy of all Subcontract,
Purchase and Hire Orders currently placed (up to 30 April 2016) to erect the Mock-Up Facility and the
Mock-Ups. These orders are accompanied by a summary sheet which is also attached to this letter. From

this summary sheet it can be seen that, to date, the total cumulative Subcontract Order value is OAR
15,963,836.00, the total cumulative Purchase Order value is OAR 5,352,877.00 and, the total cumulative
Hire Order value is OAR 1,727,433.00. It has now been decided within this update to omit the previously
included projected "Mock-Up (estimated) cosUvalue" figure because, as the Mock-Up orders are placed
and included within subsequent monthly Claim updates, this previously included projected figure loses
its relevance.

The aforementioned Orders-placed figures , along with other relevant cosUvalue figures noted within
the January 2016 update, are incorporated within the following table:

Contractor's & Subcontractors ' Prolongation Costs and Losses (January 2016 update refers)

Total cost/value incurred and/or committed to 30 April 2016 (excluding Contractor's Overheads & Profit
& Finance)
151,561,810.00

Overheads & Profit:
The Contractor's revised Overheads & Profit ("OHP") addition to the above costs/values are calculated
as follows:

QAR 151,561,810.00 (total cost/value to 30 April 2016 excluding Contractor's Overheads & Profit &
Finance) x 13% (OHP rate) = QAR 19.703,035.00 .

Contractor 's Financing Costs:
No payment has yet been received by the Contractor for combined Claim 25 & 26. The Contractor's
Finance costs are therefore calculated as follows.

Finance Costs Incurred to 30 April 2016 (on all Costs excluding Prolongation Costs):
These costs have generally been incurred from the beginning of the Delay Event (20 August 2015) to the
date of this update (30 April 2016).

QAR 15,963,836.00 (Subcontract Orders) + QAR 5,352,877.00 (Purchase Orders) + QAR 1,727,433.00
(Hire Orders) + OAR 6,873,904.00 (Design-Only Costs) = OAR 29,918,050.00.
OHP on these Costs are: QAR 29,918,050.00 x 13% = QAR 3,889,347.00.

Total Finance Costs on these Costs are:
(QAR 29,918,050.00 + QAR 3,889,347 .00) x 50% x 254 days (20.08.15 to 30.04.16)/365 days x 4.25% p.a.
= QAR 499,933.00.

Total Finance Costs to Date (30 April 2016) on Prolongation Costs: Period of Delay Event:
(QAR 121,643,760.00 (Prolongation Costs) + QAR 15,813,689.00 (OHP on Prolongation Costs)) x 50% x
115 days (Delay Event from 20.08.15 to 13.12.15)/365 days x 4 .25% p.a. = QAR 920,305.00 .

Period Post Delay Event:
(QAR 121,643,760.00 (Prolongation Costs) + QAR 15,813,689.00 (OHP on Prolongation Costs) + QAR
920,305.00 (Finance Cost to 13.12.15)) x 100% x 139 days (13.12.15 to 30.04.16)/365 days x 4.25% p.a. =
QAR 2,239,635.00.

Total Finance Costs on Prolongation Costs to 30 April 2016 are therefore:
QAR 920,305.00 (period of Delay Event) + QAR 2,239,635.00 (period post Delay Event) = QAR
3,159,940.00.

Therefore , Total Finance Costs to 30 April 2016 are:
OAR 499,933.00 (Finance on all Costs excluding Prolongation Costs) + OAR 3,159,940.00 (Finance on
Prolongation Costs) = OAR 3,659,873 .00.

OHP upon Total Finance Costs are: OAR 3,659,873.00 x 13% (OHP) = OAR 475 ,783.00.

Accordingly, Total Finance Costs to 30.04.16 including OHP upon same = OAR 3,659,873.00 + OAR
475,783.00 = OAR 4,135,656.00.

This provides an April 2016 updated Financial Summary for combined Claim 025 & 026 as follows:
