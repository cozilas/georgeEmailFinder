RE: Additional Cost Impact for Wall Access Panels Design Improvement

Dear Sir,
Further to our correspondence referenced above (2) and your subsequent letter (3), we hereby write to
advise that the information provided by you to date is deemed insufficient in order to determine your

entitlement to pursue an Engineer’s Instruction (EI). Please refer to all of the information in the email
dated 30th May 2018 (2), of which you have so far failed to provide.
As per our meeting on 3rd September 2018, please submit all documents in relation to these events,
which are to include but are not limited to:
•
Instructions issued by TCAJV and/or CMA to progress with the aforementioned works.
•
All RFI’s issued by you to TCAJV.
•
Structural calculations – Provide details of why the proposed specification was not sufficient.
Drawing particular attention to why an increase in the minimum thickness of the materials would not
have been sufficient to remedy any defects.
Please note that the resolution of the above should not impede or delay the delivery and installation of
the access panels.
It is noted that any delays, costs, losses and/or expenses incurred by us and/or any other
Subcontractor(s) arising as a result of your failure to undertake the said works expeditiously shall be at
your risk and recovered from your account in accordance with the Subcontract clauses 10.3, 16.6.1 and
other relevant clauses.

This is for your utmost attention and immediate action.
Yours faithfully,
