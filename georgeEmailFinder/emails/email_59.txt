Subject: Removal of Mr. Charbel Mallo in Accordance with Clause 14.9.3 with Immediate
Effect
Dear Sir,
Further to your letter referenced 'MTB-GL-ADAC-L-0005 dated 11th April 2018' and AECOM's response
referenced 'MTC-CMA-TCA-0401-LTR-09307 dated 12th April 2018', It has been witnessed that your Mr.
Charbel Mallo [Technical & Contract Manager] has failed to carry out his duties in accordance with t he
Project Communication Protocol procedure as stated in Clause 9.18.1 (Independent Subcontractor), to
have direct communication with the Employer without prior writte,n consent of the Contractor.
We consider the above mentioned personnel in breach of contractual obligations against Clause 9.18.1.
In summary, it is clearly observed that such personnel, has the lack of professionalism which is having a
detrimental effect on t he project and completely unacceptable by TCA JV Management. Thus, we are
left with no alternative but to instruct the removal of such personnel from this project. Accordingly, we
write to notify you of requirement for the removal of your personnel, Mr. Charbel Mallo with immediate
effect from this project under Clause 14.9.3 which for ease of reference states;
'The Contractor may require the Subcontractor to remove (or cause to be removed) any key personnel
or any other persons employed on the site or subcontract works, including the Subcontractor's
Representative if applicable, who in the reasonable opinion of the Contractor;
(a) Persists in any misconduct or lack of care,
(b) Carries out duties incompletely or negligently
(c) Fails to conform with any provisions of the Subcontract

This notice is served under Conditions of Subcontract clause 14.9.3 (a),( b) and (c). You are obliged to
take this letter as formal notification of our intention to enforce Clause 14.9.3 of the Sub-Contract
Agreement, to instruct the permanent removal from site of the abovementioned personnel.
Subsequently, in pursuant to the Clause 14.9.4, which specifies that "immediately following such
removal, the Subcontractor shall then appoint a suitable replacement". Accordingly, you are hereby
instructed to adhere to the above condition without any delay, to submit the CV of a suitable qualified
replacement for our review and approval in accordance with such Clause.
Subject: RE: Delay in Submission of As-built Drawings
Dear Sir,
Further to the receipt of letter (1) regarding the Subcontractor's schedule for the forecast submission of
as built drawings, the Contractor refers the Subcontractor to the attached email correspondence
whereby the Engineer confirmed that the 200 no. as-built drawings submitted by the Subcontractor
have been assigned a Code-1 for CAD compliance.
The Contractor is aware of the delays being currently incurred by the Design Consultant in returning the
Subcontractor's submitted as-built drawings; yet, the Contractor further notes that the Subcontractor
shall not withhold all other submittals on this basis. Moreover, there is no reason why the Subcontractor
should refuse to furnish the Contractor with the schedule of forecast as-built submissions which has
been requested by the Contractor in numerous occasions.
The Contractor reiterates therefore its request that a schedule of forecast as-built submissions is
provided by the Subcontractor without further delay.
Subject: Request for Confirmation of Variation Order for Added Clean Outs in RFI 11594
Dear Sir,
With reference to the Engineer's reply to RFI 11594 wherein the Design Consultant requested
coordinated
layouts/plans to be reviewed with ADM for sign-off, please refer to the attached drawings signed by
ADM
showing the locations of the clean-outs.
We note that the additional cleanouts due to the offset in the riser routing (point #2 of the RFI) are not
shown in the latest or previous revisions of the relevant IFC plans (refer to attachments).
We consic{er the Engineer has issued instructions constituting a Variation which are not in the form of,
or
which have not been confirmed in writing by the Engineer by way of a formal Variation Order.
In accordance with Conditions of Contract (COC) clause 20.1.4 (b), please provide a formal confirmation
of
Variation or issue an Engineer's instruction and revised Drawings and/or Specification pursuant to COC
11.3.3. and 20.1.1 (a).
In the event the Engineer does not take the above Contract required actions then in accordance with
COC

clause 20.1.5 the Contractor would not be able to proceed with the implementation of the above
described Variation. Should this materialise then the Employer shall be solely responsible for all
consequential impacts due to late or untimely confirmations.
Kindly be guided accordingly.

Subject: Request for Confirmation of Variation Order for Electrical Closets without Smoke
Detectors (RFEI/0401/0618)
Dear Sir,
With reference to your letter (3) above please be advised that the information, comments, clarifications
and/or instructions contained therein (albeit not properly set out as IFC) constitute an instruction of
Variation.
The Engineer's response to RFEI/0401/0618 requires 38 additional smoke detectors in various Electrical
Closets as set out in the schedule provided (ARUP File Note ref. 122222/SF/MEP/074 Electrical closets
that require smoke detectors).
Arup's letter reference 122222/SL/0890 dated 30 March 2017 (copy enclosed for reference as
Attachment
A), expressly states that "The originai/FC showed sprinklers only which is permitted by code but does
not provide a room address at the fire alarm panel, in Bulletin 134" whereby "at the request of ADAC
Operations, smoke detectors were added to small individual rooms such as electrical closets ... "
For the avoidance of any doubt, the Engineer remains responsible for setting out the requirements in a
clear and unambiguous without resorting to misrepresentations of hard facts by reference to "design
intents." Had those intents been so clearly set out in Bulletin 134 documents in the first instance, there
would not have been any need to provide a table to set out the additional requirements.
In addition, please be advised that most of these rooms have already been constructed. As a result this
late change will cause abortive Works and significant delays to the Electrical closets which will in turn
delay the Works.
We consider the Engineer has issued instructions constituting a Variation which are not in the form of,
or which have not been confirmed in writing by the Engineer by way of a formal Variation Order.
In accordance with Conditions of Contract (COC) clause 20.1.4 (b), please provide a formal confirmation
of Variation or issue an Engineer's instruction and revised Drawings and/or Specification pursuant to
COC 11.3.3 and 20.1.1 (a).
In the event the Engineer does not take the above Contract required actions then in accordance with
COC clause 20.1.5 the Â·contractor would not be able to proceed with the implementation of the above
described Variation. Should this materialise then the Employer shall be solely responsible for all
consequential impacts due to late or untimely confirmations.
Kindly be guided accordingly
Yours faithfully
