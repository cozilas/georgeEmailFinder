Subject: Request for Change Management Day Work Rates
Dear Sir,
We write pursuant to the Letter of Award Agreement referenced above and with regards to the "Change
Management Day Work Rates" subject matter. We have requested you to work out details for various
Briefing Packs and as instructed through our Contractor's Instructions, you are also required to attend
necessary workshops to progress on the joint design basis in order to achieve the required level.
Therefore, we invite you to provide the name of the persons/staff of your organization entrusted with
that development. In addition, we require the day work rates per hour applicable to each person for the
various positions to allow you to claim for payment.
These day work rates should be provided together with adequate substantiation indicating how they
were calculated in order to prevent any delay or rejection of your invoice for payment.
This is for your information, record and further necessary action
Yours faithfully,
