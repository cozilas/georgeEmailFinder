Subject: Water Spillage on Installed Flooring Tiles at CP Level 2.0 Zone 07 & Zone 09
Dear Sir,
We refer to the above mentioned letter, please note that after each stone installation MOSART are fully
responsible to protect their material until the final handing over to TCAJV, any delay by protecting the
material is MOSART failure. Moreover we have inspected the area and it is protected now.
Please make sure to protect all your areas after the stone installation.
Yours faithfully,
