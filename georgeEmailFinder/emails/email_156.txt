Subject RE: Request for Closure of CODE-3 WIR's Corrective Actions Required from TCAJV's Others
Subcontractors
Dear Sir,
The Contractor confirms receipt of the Subcontractor's letter reference (1) which requests the
Contractor takes ownership and closes 82 no. Work Inspection Requests (WIR) which have currently
been assigned a code-3 status by the Engineer/Employer.
To be clear, the Subcontractor shall remain responsible for executing and completing the Subcontract
Works in accordance with the Subcontract (including all painting works). If as a result of any inspection,
workmanship is found not in accordance with the Subcontract, the Contractor and/or Engineer may
reject such workmanship by giving notice to the Subcontractor with reasons (code-3 WIR). The
Subcontractor shall then make good the defect and ensure that the rejected item complies with the
Subcontract.
In other words, addressing the comments provided by the Engineer and obtaining a code-1 in all WIRs
are integral parts of the Subcontractor's obligations under the Subcontract. Therefore, the Contractor
rejects the Subcontractor's attempt to convey the false impression that the Contractor's personnel have
agreed to assume this responsibility on behalf of the Subcontractor and confirms that this duty will not
be transferred.
Notwithstanding this, the Contractor confirms that it will continue to assist the Subcontractor in
addressing the Engineer's comments (particularly, when the Subcontractor has proven these to be
unfair) and obtaining the Engineer's final approval for the Subcontract Works.
Yours faithfully,
