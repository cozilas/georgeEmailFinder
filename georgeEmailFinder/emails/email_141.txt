Subject Contractors Reduction in Resources and Materials- External Works
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to the ongoing Subsidence Rectification Works for which the progress has
been detrimentally impacted over recent weeks with a significant reduction in resources
(labouroperatives
and management, plant, materials and logistics) at site. To this extent, the Engineer is
informing the Contractor that the completion and handover of Pier 4 and Pier 3 rectification works (up
until the MTA Tunnel at GH 29) as to facilitate the communicated Employer's South Side transition
plan to airside by P 1 May 2020 is now at risk. It is imperative that the Contractor immediately takes
measures to address the declining resources and material provisions and makes every effort to
mitigate delays to the completion of the South Side rectification works and facilitate the taking over of

Piers 4, 3 and associated external areas by the Employer.
The Contractor will be held culpable for all the time and costs associated with such delays and the
availability of the South Side areas pursuant to Clause 10.3 of the Conditions of Contract.
Yours faithfully,
