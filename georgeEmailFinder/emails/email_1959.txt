Dear Sir,

The Contractor acknowledges receipt of the Engineer's Assistant's letter referenced 1) on 03 May 2017
and notes that the Engineer's Assistant's proposal does not respond to the original intent of the
Contractor's proposal which was to ensure that the Project has the cash it requires in order to assist
with expediting the Works. The Engineer's Assistant's insistence that ".fill events" be achieved
effectively defer the potential injection of much-needed cash until the very last item has been achieved
and therefore would at best result in a certification in August 2017, with the actual disbursement no
earlier than October 2017.

The Contractor would remind the Engineer's Assistant that the total value of the Overheads,
Management and Attendances are to be duly paid to the Contractor, and there is no rational benefit to
the Project of payment of these sums being effected after all the relevant costs have been incurred.

The Engineer's Assistant's letter further reads that "it will check and verify their completeness prior to
seeking the Employer's approval following confirmation of achievement or otherwise of all events"
meaning that the corresponding balance of OMAs might be certified once all deliverables are delivered
subject to Contractor's notification, Engineer's Assistant's verificat ion and Employer's approval.

The Contractor's proposal centred around meeting targets that were effectively Early Start dates in its
programme, whereas the subsequent clarification received from the Engineer's Assistant that it expects
screed works (for example) to begin across all ten stations even where these were not planned to begin
is effectively an attempt to force the Contractor to accelerate in order to secure the payment of moneys
that it was in any case due.

The Contractor's current cashflow predicament is compounded by the fact that it has not been paid
anything for the now extensive blockwork walls it has constructed across all the stations pending the
division of the BoH milestones into meaningful subcategories, and the circa 70 million still not certified
by the Engineer's Assistant for work that is otherwise complete but for which the data pack is not
complete/certified. With regards to the latter, the Contractor respects the need to see quality records
properly updated and NCR's closed-out, but the Contractor would remind the Engineer's Assistant and
the Employer that the Contract already provides for a 5% retention of all moneys as a guarantee of good
performance , in addition to Performance Bond of 10% of the Contract Price. Further holding back
certification therefore is only hurting the Project.

The Contractor is disappointed that its efforts to commence works as early as possible and its push to
issue Purchase Orders for materials have not yielded any improvement to its cashflow, nevertheless the
Contractor remains available to discuss with the Engineer's Assistant a way to close out this matter
amicably while addressing both Parties' concerns, in accordance with the pro rata basis referred within
Sub-Clause 9.1.2.9
m) i) of Volume 2.

Yours faithfully,
