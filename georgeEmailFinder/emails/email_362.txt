Subject:SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0123
Overdue Response to Material Submittal MS/0401/C/0877 Rev. 01
– Key Cabinet & Keying Control System
Dear Sir

Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and / or circumstances described in
Annex A may cause delay and/or disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
The matters described in Annex A concern potential delays to the Works due to your failure to respond
to MS/0401/C/0877 Rev. 01 within the review times expressly stipulated in the Contract.
Potential Impact
Delay and disruption due to the events and circumstances outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
likely to impact on achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required:
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Specifically we urge you to review and respond to MS/0401/C/0877 Rev. 01 without further undue
delay. Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned immediately upon receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
On 25 June 2019, we submitted Material Submittal No. MS/0401/C/0877 Rev. 01 [dated 20 June 2019]
in the manner shown in Table 1 below, seeking your approval of the Key Cabinet and Keying Control
System for the Project, as described and detailed therein. Attached thereto was a Reply to Comments
Sheet, Software Format, Keyway Patent, a Photo of Sample, and One (1) Set of Samples.

Article 1.3 of Specification Section 013300 ‘Submittal Procedures’ governs the processing time by which
you are contractually obligated to respond to our Submittals. On the basis that Material Submittal No:
MS/0401/C/0877 is shown to be at Rev. 01 then this ought to have been responded to by you 14
calendar days later, i.e. on or before 9 July 2019. However, Table 1 indicates that at the cut-off date
associated with preparation of this Notice (i.e. 6 August 2019), you exceeded and are continuing to
exceed the review period expressly stipulated in the Contract by 28 calendar days.
Potential Impact:
The delayed and overdue response to Material Submittal No: MS/0401/C/0877 rev. 01 is hampering our
ability to procure, deliver and subsequently install the Key Cabinets and complete the Key Control
Systems for the Project, and will directly affect our ability to complete the Works and consequently
delay testing and commissioning. This will invariably impact upon our ability to achieve Milestone
MS09B, and may also prevent us from achieving Substantial Completion (i.e. Milestone MS09C).

Yours faithfully,
