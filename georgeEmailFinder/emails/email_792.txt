Re: Variation No. 2 – Damaged Operators & Sensors

Dear Sir,
We acknowledge receipt of your variation cost proposal vide letter referenced in (4) above for the
damages caused by another subcontractor. After our review, below is the list of our queries:
1)
Quantity take off sheets that include drawing references are required to substantiate your
quantities.
2)
Quotations/Purchase orders/Invoices are required to substantiate each rate build-up.
3)
Further breakdown is required including the total man-hours for ‘Cost of Removal & Reinstallation.
4)
Please note that VAT is not applicable for Cost proposals as this is applicable to Payment
Certificates only.
5)
Invoice for freight charges specifically for the items being claimed is required.
At present we can not forward your cost proposal to the responsible subcontractors (as highlighted in
our letter referenced in (3) above) without the above information, hence, you are requested to review
your cost again and resubmit a detailed Proposal with all substantiation within seven (7) days of receipt
of this letter.

This is for your information and immediate action.
Yours faithfully,
