Dear Sir,

With reference to the above subject, the Contractor notifies receipt of an email at reference 2 from an
Ashghal representative requesting the Contractor to upgrade the sewer network line passing at Qatari
Bin Fujaah Street.

The Contractor issued formal correspondence to Ashghal, reference 1 above, to inform that the
Contractor's Contract with Qatar Rail only allows for the diversion I protection of utilities,and would only
be able to upgrade subject sewer line following the receipt of a written Instruction from Qatar Rail
pursuant to the Clause 13.1.1 of the Volume 3 of the Contract.

The works have progressed and now require a permit to reconnect to the existing manholes but Ashghal
have informed us that they will withhold the permit until the upgrade works are completed.This is now
causing delay to the completion of the diversion works which will impact on the completion of the
station if the situation is not resolved urgently.

An alternative proposal has been stated in the letter to Ashghal to complete this upgrade at a later more
suitable time and prompt action by Qatar Rail with Ashghal may resolve the situation.

The Contractor hereby gives notice subject to clause 8.3.7 of volume 3 Conditions of Contract of a
probable future event that may adversely affect the Programme, increase the Contract Price or delay
the execution of the works.

This is for your information and action.
Yours faithfully,
