Dear Sir,

Further to the Contractor's fully detailed interim ELS Claim submission (Revision 1) issued under cover of
reference 15 and, further to the Contractor's November 20 15 monthly update of same issued under
cover of reference 3, the Contractor hereby provides, in accordance with General Condition ("GC")
20.1.6(b) of Volume 3 of the Contract, its December 2015 monthly update of the ELS Claim with respect
to the following additional financial information.

The November 2015 ELS Claim update contained the following Financial Summary:

Description of Value/Cost
Qatari Riyals
Additional Site Running Costs to date (Loss and/or Expense)

149,249, 110.00

Add itional Design Costs to date [Atkins claim, O&K, Arup] + DVE 10,930,825.00
Value of ELS Variation to date
Disruption Costs

147,719,261.00

TBC

Contractor's Overheads & Profit to date 40,026,895.00
Finance Charges to date (including OHP upon same)

Total Claim (to date)

17,115,308.00

365,041,399.00

No payment has been received by the Contractor with respect to ELS Claim. Accordingly the total
finance costs to date (31.12.15) and, overheads and profit upon same are calculated as follows:

(1)
Total Claim Value for November (excluding Finance Charges) = QAR 365,041 ,399.00 - QAR
17,115,308.00 = QAR 347,926,091.00.

(2)

Finance Costs from 25 March 2014 to 30 June 2015:

The Contractor was delayed and started to incur additional costs from the initial 25 March 2014 ELS
Presentation. Therefore , up to the date of the 30 June 2015 ELS Claim update, the financing costs
incurred are as follows :

QAR 347,926,09 1.00 (Total Claim Costs to 30 June 2015 excluding finance costs) x 0.5 x 432 days/365
days
x 4.25% pa = QAR 8,750,579.00.

(3)

Finance Costs from 30 June 2015 to 31 December 2015:

(QAR 347,926,091.00 (Total Claim Costs from 30 June 2015 to 31 December 2015 excluding f inance &
associated OHP costs) x 184 days/365 days x 4.25% pa = QAR 7,454, 197

(4)
Therefore, Total Finance Costs from 25 March 2014 to 31 December 2015 are: QAR
8,750,579.00 + QAR 7,454,197.00 = QAR 16,204,776.00.
(4)
Overheads and Profit ("OHP") upon Total Finance Costs from 25 March 2014 to 31 December
2015 are: QAR 16,204,776 x 13% OHP = QAR 2,106,621 .00.

(5)
are:

Therefore, Total Finance Charges and OHP on same from 25 March 2014 to 31 December 2015

QAR 16,204,776 + OAR 2, 106,621 = OAR 18,311,397.00

Accordingly , the revised/updated ELS Claim financial amount at 31 December 2015 is collated within
the revised ELS Claim Financial Summary below:

FINANCIAL SUMMARY

Description of Value/Cost
Qatari Riyals
Additional Site Running Costs to date (Loss and/or Expense)

Additional Design Costs to date [Atkins claim, O&K, Arup] + DVE 10,930,825.00

Total Claim (to date)

18,311,397 .00

366,237,488.00

This ELS Claim December 2015 update therefore contains a revised total claimed amount of QAR
366,237,488 .00.

As the event giving rise to this Claim has a continuing effect and the Contractor is still collating further
particulars, the Contractor shall be submitting further interim Claim submissions with respect to the
