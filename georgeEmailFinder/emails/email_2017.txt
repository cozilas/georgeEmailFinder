Dear Sir,
Engineer's Assistant refers to letter reference 2), wherein the Contractor was directed to submit a
quotation for any cost and time impact. The Contractor's response was due by 27 June 2016, but to date
the Contractor has not provided a quotation.

Further to letter reference 1) and 5), the Contractor's delay in providing the quotation is preventing the
Engineer from making an informed decision under the Sub-Clause 13.2.3.

The Con1ractor is directed to provide the quotation without any further delay.

Yours faithfully,
