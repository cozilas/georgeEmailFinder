Dear Sir,

Your letter reference M006-GDB-COM-LTR-00 930 dated 20 January 2015 is referred.

The arguments raised by the Contractor in the referenced letter with regard to DVE's scope of works are
flawed and groundless, and intending to distort what is factual.

Sub-clause 9.1.2.5 (f)(ii)(H) of Volume 2 stipulates:

" The Design Verification Engineer 's scope of work will apply to all defined wrks within the Accepted
Contract Amount , covering both the lump sum and the Provisional Sum portions of the Accepted
Contract Amount . The Contractor's Design Verification Engineer will be expected to exercise the same
professional standards across all aspects of the works under the Contract. The Accepted Contract
Amount includes the DVE's full scope of work which includes checking and certifying the provisional sum
elements of the Works."

Despite the above clause reference, which has succinctly defined the Contractor's responsibility with
regard to the DVE scope of works, it is disappointing that the Contractor chose to make it an issue and
moreover, stated in the letter that an Engineer's Instruction will be needed in order for the Contractor
to progress further .

This Contractor's letter has exemplified the current obstructive attitude of the Contractor's commerc ial
The Engineer's Assistant acknowledges receipt of your letter referenced M006-GDB-COM-LTR-02036
received on 29 July 2015.

This is notice under Sub-Clause 20.1.8 that the claim Is disapproved. Detailed comments are as attached
to the Engineer's Assistant referenced letter of 26 April 2015. The Engineer's Assistant considers that the
effects resulting from the event or circumstance have ended.
Yours faithfully,
