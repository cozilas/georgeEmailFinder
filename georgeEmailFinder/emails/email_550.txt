Dear Sir,

RE: Variation for SS 2mm thick perforated panels

Following receipt of your request for a variation order (RFVO) detailed under the above correspondence
(2) and subsequent discussions during our site meeting held 17th January 2019, we hereby request the
resubmission of the above once you have collated all the required information and presented this in the
correct RFVO format.
Furthermore, in your correspondence you state your entitlement for ‘additional cost and time’. We
reiterate that any extension of the Subcontract Time for completion and entitlement will be on the
condition you have fully complied with all of your related obligations under the Subcontract. Please
ensure any requests for additional time are carefully considered – as you’re kindly reminded of the
delays incurred by us as a result of your failure to submit samples in line with the required specification.
This is for your information and necessary action.

Yours faithfully,
