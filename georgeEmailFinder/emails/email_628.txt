Re: Ceiling Works- Passing Corridor Lack of Performance

Dear Sir,
We are in receipt of your letter referenced (1) above, where you have commented on the progress of
the ceiling works in the central processor in particular at the Passing Corridor of Level 1.0 and we would
like to comment as follows.
We acknowledge your concern about the progress of the mentioned works and inform you that the
ceiling panels as advised by the material’s supplier, are very sensitive and should not be fixed until the
completion of Testing and Commissioning works. These materials would most likely be damaged if they
are installed in an uncontrolled environment as they are “long lead” materials made in Canada, as per
the manufacturer’s Specification, enclosed herewith which is self-explanatory. As per the
manufacturer's Specification, to avoid any deficiencies the panels should be on site 24 hours prior to
installation to adjust to the environment.

In regards to your comments about the mitigation plan, please note that the submitted revision 11
programme as per the agreed level one programme, includes mitigation measures so that there are no
negative impacts to the Project milestone dates.
We trust you find the aforementioned self-explanatory and clarifies the matter.
Yours faithfully,
