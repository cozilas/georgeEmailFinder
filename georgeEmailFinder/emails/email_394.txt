Subject: ITF Environment Control Risks Reminder
Dear Sir,
We hereby forward our ICT subcontractor's correspondence dated 02 June 2019, once again raising
their concern at the environmental conditions and up-keep of the Test Lab.
It is evident that despite numerous previous reminders, the Employer continues to fail in its duty to
maintain and provide the facility to an acceptable condition. The on-going unacceptable conditions
have reached such a state that despite our own increased cleaning efforts, they now jeopardise our
ability to provide the ICT equipment in accordance with the Contract. As noted in the
aforementioned attached letter, the dilapidated building fabric is leading to dust and foreign particles
entering the equipment and this will potentially invalidate the warranty conditions of the suppliers.

A report will be forwarded shortly detailing the inipact of the continued poor conditions on the ICT
equipment. In the meantime, you are requested to take immediate steps to improve the
environmental conditions at the facility.
Yours faithfully,
