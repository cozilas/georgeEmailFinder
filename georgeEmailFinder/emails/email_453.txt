Article 1.3 of Specification Section 013300 ‘Submittal Procedures’ governs the processing time by which
you are contractually obligated to respond to our submittals. On the basis that each of the material
Submittals listed in Table 1 is at Rev. 00 then these ought to have been responded to by you 21 calendar
days later. However, the information recorded in Table 1 shows that at the cut-off date associated with
this E-Notice (10 April 2019), you exceeded, and in one instance (item 1) continue to exceed the review
periods expressly stipulated in the Contract, by upwards of 48 calendar days.
Additionally, we further record that the responses to Material Submittal No. MS/0401/A/1720 Rev. 00
and MS/0401/A/17207 Rev. 00 (identified at Items 1 and 2 in Table 1), contain what we contend are a
series of unreasonable comments, despite the door hardware subject to these submittals being
compliant. The information recorded in Table 2 below, records the particular comments in question,
alongside we have provides a response justifying why we believe those comments are unreasonable.

CODE 3 COMMENT:
1.The hardware set configurations call for power transfer
pivots. What is submitted is a power transfer loop. Electric
power transfer loop (EPTL) submitted is not acceptable.
MS-C-0564-02 has an approved EPT 10 which can also be used on this submittal. Contractor to submit
EPT 10.
Power transfer pivots are not compatible with the hinges as listed in the hardware set. The
proposed product, Securitron EPT, is compliant with requirement as per spec to have 'steel housing for
mortise in hinge stile of door, with flexible tube for wiring'. There is no valid reason for rejection of
material.
Specification Section 087110 2.31.D States:
Door and Frame Transfer Devices: Steel housing for mortise in hinge stile of door, with flexible tube for
wiring bundle; accommodating doors that swing open to 180 degrees.
1. Concealed PTFE-jacketed wires, secured at each leaf and continuous through sleeve.

We note that the foregoing affect 14 doors in total; 3 in Pier 2 and 11 in the Central Processor.
Potential Impact:
Your Status Code 2 or higher approval of the Material Submittals for the Hardware for Smoke Rated
Doors listed in Table 1 is essential in so far as it affects testing and Commissioning which is similarly
essential in enabling us obtain the Building Completion Certificate (BCC). This is critical to achieving
Milestone No. MS09B. Consequently, the more you unduly prolong the review and approval of these
Smoke Rated Door Hardware Submittals and subject them to unnecessary and unreasonable Status
Code 3 comments, the more likely this will prevent us from achieving Substantial Completion.
Action Required:
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are resolved within ten (10) days from the date of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
Yours faithfully,
