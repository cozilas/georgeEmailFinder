Dear Sirs,

Further to the Contractor's initial interim Claim Nr 035 submission issued under cover of reference 7 and
the Contractor's monthly updates of same issued via references 2 and 4, the Contractor confirms within
this February 2016 monthly update (in accordance with General Condition ("GC") 20.1.6(b) of Volume 3
of the Contract),that no additional information has been received by the Contractor over the past month
concerning the subject matter of Claim Nr 035 .

However, to date, the Contractor has received no payment from the Employer with respect to Claim Nr
035. Accordingly, the Contractor provides this February 2016 Financial monthly update to Claim Nr 035
as follows.

As mentioned within the January 2016 monthly update, the Contractor received its Design Verification
Engineer's ("DVE") claim (dated 12 January 2016) with respect to the Claim Event for the sum of OAR
1,617,213.00. This sum was included within the Contractor's Claim 035 January 2016 monthly update
along with the Contractor's overheads and profit ("OHP") addition upon same for OAR 210,238. 00.
Finance costs are therefore due from the DVE claim date of 12 January 2016 as follows:

(OAR 1,617,213.00.00 (DVE claim) + OAR 210,238.00 (OHP on last)) x 48 days (12 January 2016 to 29
February 2016)/365 days x 4.25% p.a. (Finance rate) = OAR 10,214.00.

OHP upon Finance costs = OAR 10,214.00 x 13% (OHP rate) = OAR 1328.00.

Therefore ,total Finance Costs including OHP upon same = OAR 10,214.00 + OAR 1328.00 = OAR
11,542.00. This provides a February 2016 updated Financial Summary for Claim 035 as follows:
