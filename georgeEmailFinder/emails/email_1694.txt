Dear Sir,
The Consultant is hereby instructed to take all the necessary actions in order to ensure the integration in
the
002 design submittals of the SAP drawings for Joaan Station enclosed herewith, except:

a)
for the situations where this conflicts with the Client's instruction under letter reference 1)
regarding the implementation of the proposed Option 5 for the urban integration of Pop-Ups at Joaan
Station;
b)
where the distance between the Emergency Vehicle Parking and the Fireman's Entry Point (core
only, not entrance) is greater than 10m if SAP is followed.

The Client confirms that this instruction is given pursuant to Sub-Clause 4.6 [Variations and
Adjustments] of the Agreement. Accordingly, the Consultant is requested to submit a proposal for this
variation with details of any anticipated extension of the Time for Completion and/or a proposed
adjustment of the Fee. Upon receipt thereof, the Client shall make a fair adjustment to the Fee in
accordance with Sub-Clause 4.11 [Valuation of Variations].

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.
Yours faithfully,
