Delayed Access to Central Processor Retail Unit 2014 – Acts of Prevention on the part of Others –
Delaying Completion of HVAC Testing and Commissioning Works
Dear Sirs,
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
The matters described in Annex A hereto, concern acts of prevention on the part of the Employer’s
Other Contractor denying us access to Retail Unit 2014, which is delaying Testing and Commissioning
Works.
Potential Impact
Delay and disruption due to the events and circumstances outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
likely to impact on the achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned immediately upon receipt of this e-notice.
Accordingly, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the delaying event described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
On 1 April 2020, we submitted Re-Entry Permit / NOC RDD-1042, requesting re-entry / access to Central
Processor (CP) Retail Unit (RU) 2014 to allow us to complete the Heat Ventilation Air Conditioning
(HVAC) Testing and Commissioning (TC) Works. However, despite us raising RDD-1042 on 1 April 2020,
it took you five (5) calendar days later, until 6 April 2020 to respond; which even allowing a nominal
three-day turn-around time for you to process, meant it was returned two calendar days late (Table 1
below, refers).

Notwithstanding the late response, we further note that RDD-1042 had been returned back classified as
“Rejected”, due to the Employer’s Tenant Contractor (M/s BWI) stating:
“BWI Comments for RDD Permit: 1. BWI Storage area for tools and materials. No storekeeper and area is
fully congested. Will approve once we are back on site”.
We were informed of this by your e-mail dated 6 April 2020 [2:20 PM]. However, when we enquired as
to when M/s BWI would be back on site, you informed vide e-mail also dated 6 April 2020 [6:02 PM],
that the Employer’s Tenant Contractor “will be back at site in 20th of April” (refer to Figure 1). We then
wrote to you again by way of a further e-mail dated 7 April 2020 [8.54 AM], giving you advance notice
that this ‘event’ is “delaying our works” (copies of our various e-mail exchanges are attached at Annex B
hereto):

However, despite you advising us that the Employer’s Tenant Contractor would return on 20 April 2020,
this failed to happen. In fact, at the date of drafting this E-Notice (6 May 2020), we have yet to be
provided access to RU-2014 to complete our Works. This is ‘act of prevention’ is entirely beyond our
control and responsibility and is preventing us from completing testing and commissioning; and is likely
to prevent us obtaining the Building Completion Certificate (BCC). This is critical in us achieving
completion of Milestone MS09B and will invariably prevent us from achieving Substantial Completion
(i.e. Milestone MS09C).
Yours faithfully,
