Dear Sir,
Further to the above referenced subject we request your confirmation as follow.
We received Engineer’s Instructions No. 736 and responded through our letter ref 2) by providing you
with ROM-0401-1979-REV.00.
This was never in our scope of work and was not concluded before the Amendment Effective Date of 4
September 2018 and remains an outstanding issue which is not subject to Sub-Clause 1.7.2 and 1.7.4 of
the Settlement Agreement and Amendment Number 8 (SAA8).
Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement and Amendment Number 8 (SAA8) Variations Clauses 2.29, 2.30
and 2.31, notwithstanding the terms of Conditions of Contract Clause 20.3 (Variation Procedure) the
Engineer shall not instruct any Variation after the Amendment Effective Date of 4 September 2018
unless all the requirements of these SAA8 Clauses have been fulfilled in their entirety.
Please let us know whether or not these changes are required: if they are we will compile our cost and
programme impact (if any) proposals for your and ADAC’s agreement. If and when we receive a
Variation Order confirming agreement with our proposals we will proceed with these varied Works.
Yours faithfully
