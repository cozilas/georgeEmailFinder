Notice to Correct – Zone 11 Welcome Hall

Dear Sir,
We write further to our previous numerous notifications (emails hereby enclosed) regarding the
discrepancies of the coordinates used in Zone 12 and 11 in the Welcome Hall area. We put on record
that you have not used the approved coordinates for the works on site as per shop-drawings reference
SDS/0401/A/1562-05 and that the actual coordinates of the works on site done by you do not match
with the coordinates shown in your latest shop-drawings.
We regret to notice that despite our instructions and notifications to correct, the discrepancy between
actual works on site and your latest shop-drawings has not been rectified. Consequently, you are
instructed pursuant to Clauses 11.3 [Instructions of the Contractor] and 22.1 [Notice to Correct] to
immediately proceed with all required rectifications of the works on site based on the coordinates
shown in your latest and approved shop-drawings.
Please be informed that in case no immediate action is taken, we will have no other option than to
deploy all necessary resources to complete the works on your behalf, which you will be backcharged
accordingly as per Clause 10.3 [Contractor's Claims].
In view of the above, please be informed that any delays, costs, losses and/or expenses and the like
incurred by us and/or Other Sub-Contractors arising as a result of your failure to complete the
aforementioned activities will be solely your responsibility pursuant but not limited to Clauses 10.3
[Contractor’s Claims], 12.12 [Other Contractors and Other Subcontractors] and 16.6.1 [Delay Damages].
Yours faithfully,
