Subject: Overdue Spare Parts, Tools and Extra Material Submittal
Dear Sir,
With reference to the above mentioned letters, the Contractor highlights with great concern the
Subcontractor's unresponsiveness and lack of proper action to address the delays and concerns raised in
the aforementioned letters.
To date, you have not submitted the overdue "Spare parts, Tools & Extra materials (STE)" submittal;
even more disturbing is the fad that, despite having already expressed our concerns to you regarding
your substandard performance, there has not been any attempt on your part to recover the delays and
no affirmative action has been taken. Please refer to our emails (attached) reminding you of these
obligations which you have failed to address.
The consequences of your continuous failure and poor performance have impacted our commitment to
the Client; therefore, you are urgently requested to consider this matter as "high priority" and to submit
the delayed submittal within five (5) days of receiving of this letter.
Yours faithfully,
