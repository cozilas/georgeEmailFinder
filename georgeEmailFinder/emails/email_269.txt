Subject Adverse Weather Preparedness
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence (1) and further to the recent warning from the
Meteorological Agency that further adverse weather conditions are expected the following days.
We note, that we have yet to receive a response regarding the impacted areas of works from the
previous rainfall (1) and request that the Contractor immediately provides the requested survey.
Furthermore, the Contractor shall implement all necessary measures to protect the works and prepare
for the potential of high winds and additional rain.
In addition to the above, particular attention should be implemented in the protection of the installed
infrastructure within and below open excavations.
The Contractor's immediate action is required.
Yours faithfully,
