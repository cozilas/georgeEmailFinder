Subject:Canopy Works Package – Notice of Delay – Further Delays to Procurement Activities

Dear Sir,
Further to our previously issued correspondences (7 & 8), we hereby issue this notice of delay regarding
your failure to procure materials in line with site requirements and the previously agreed milestone
dates. As per your discussions with our Procurement Department (3rd March 2019), and subsequent
meetings with our Construction and Commercial Teams you have now stated the delivery of the Canopy
Columns will now be delivered later than agreed, thus delaying site installation by the same. Our
Construction Team has stated that this is now severely impacting the availability work fronts for
following and adjacent work packages.
Please be reminded that the above is unacceptable and we therefore instruct you to submit a revised
programme and action plan demonstrating how you will recover progress following these delays. We
take this opportunity to remind you of your obligations as set out under the Subcontract - Clause 8.1.2
[Subcontractors Obligations]. Moreover, Subcontract Clause 16.1.1 [Commencement of Subcontract
Works] provides that you are obliged to progress the Subcontract Works with due expedition and
without delay, and should neither delay nor adversely affect the performance of TCAJV or other
subcontractors.
Please note that any delays, costs, losses and/or expenses incurred by us and/or Other Subcontractor/s
arising as a result of the incurred delays shall be at your risk and recovered from your account in
accordance with the Subcontract clauses 10.3[Contractor’s Claims], 16.6.1 [Delay Damages] and other
relevant clauses.
This is for your information and necessary action.

Yours faithfully,
