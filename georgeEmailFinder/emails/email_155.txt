Dear Sir,
We write with reference to the enclosed LPO referenced in (2) above and we hereby confirm that we
have already arranged the Fabricator for the Installation of Halfen Channel on your behalf.
Pursuant to the Conditions of Subcontract Agreement Clause 10.3 (Contractorâ€™s Claims), we hereby
confirm our entitlement to deduct such amounts but not limited to the enclosed, from your interim
payments accordingly. The basis of these charges is due to the fact that the works are being carried out
on your behalf, due to your failure to perform your Subcontract obligations.
In addition, we shall back charge any amount that falls under your responsibility in accordance to Clause
12.12.4 (Other Contractors and Other Subcontractors), whereby you are liable to the Contractor for any
claim by the Employer, other Contractors or other Subcontractors for the costs arising out of your failure
to perform your obligations under the Subcontract.
This is for your information and future reference.
Yours Faithfully,
