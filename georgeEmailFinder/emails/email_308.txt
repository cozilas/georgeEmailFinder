Subject: Engineer's Delay Notification - Concerns Over Site Based Resources due to
Strike Action and Declining Staff Numbers
Dear Sir,
Â· We write with reference to your letter (1), in which you notify us of your concerns over site-based
resources due to strike action and declining staff numbers.
We can confirm that the strike action related to one of our manpower supply companies. Labourers
supplied by this company staged a strike for one day due to the manpower supply company stopping
payment of the labour food allowance as the labour supply company started supplying the food. Half
of the manpower returned to site a Clay later and all were back on site on the following day.

We are in daily dialogue with our Subcontractors to ensure that manpower and adequate supervision
is at site to deliver the works as planned.
With regards to our own supervision at site, at this stage of the project it is normal practice to see
slight reductions in the numbers as certain activities are well progressed, therefore requiring less
direct supervision. We are confident that have adequate supervision to manage the remaining onsite
activities.
We conclude by reiterating that we remain fully committed to ADAC, the Project and to completing
our obligations within the shortest possible time, without compromising on safety and quality, but
will not be held responsible for such factors for which we are not culpable.
Yours faithfully,
