on behalf of the Engineer

Dear Sir,

The Engineer's Assistant refers to your letter above, ref 1), and emphasizes that Qatar Rail Architect and
the Engineer's Assistant signed the aforement ioned drawings on the basis that they demonstrate
incorporation of "Five Key Issues" only. This exercise was necessary in order to allow the Contractor to
commence Architectural Branding M1 design.

The Engineer's Assistant notes that Contractor has yet to submit evidence that the Engineer's Assistant's
DD1 comments relating to architecture have been fully addressed and are capable of achieving SONO
status. The Engineer's Assistant further highlights that the Contractor has not yet submitted an MEP
OD1 submission for this station nor demonst rated that Structural, Architectural and MEP designs are
integrated.

Finally, in order for the Contractor to achieve SONO status current SAP baseline drawings need to be
reflected in your design.

In conclusion, to-date the Contractor has yet to provide a OD1 Submission for SONO for any
architectural packages and this is an issue which must be addressed immediately.

We look forward to Contractor's focus and outcomes on the above issues.
Yours faithfully,
