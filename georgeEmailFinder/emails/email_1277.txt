Subject:
Dear Sir,

Area of Concerns for Non Accessibility on Site Delay Damages

With reference to the above subject and in continuation to your letter referenced (1) above, we hereby
inform you that we have forwarded your concern to M/S Al Ghurair as described in the said letter and
we are in the process of preparing a response to the rest of the Subcontractors allegedly affecting your
works, instructing them to coordinate accordingly.
Notwithstanding the above, you are hereby informed pursuant but not limited to Clauses 12.12.1,
12.12.2 (a), (b) and 12.12.3
[Other Contractors and Other Subcontractors] that the access to the
Site is not exclusive and that Other Subcontractors may perform work on the Site concurrently.
Moreover, as an experienced Subcontractor and as per Clause 12.12.3 you should have allowed in your
Subcontract Price for all delays, disruptions and costs you may incur arising out of or in connection with
the work to be performed by Other Subcontractors.
In view of the above, please note that Clause 12.12.3 further states that:
“The Subcontractor agrees it has allowed in the Subcontract Price for all delays, disruptions and costs it
may incur arising out of or in connection with the work to be performed by Other Contractors and Other
Subcontractors or otherwise to comply with its obligations pursuant to this clause 12.12 including but
not limited to those interfaces set out in the interface table included in Schedule 12 (Specification) to
the extent that such matters are known or ought reasonably to have been known by the Subcontractor
on or before the date of execution of the Subcontract. The Subcontractor agrees that it shall not be
entitled to any extension of the Subcontract Time for Completion, reimbursement of additional cost or
adjustment to the Subcontract Price in respect of any delay or disruption caused by having to comply
with its obligations pursuant to this clause 12.12 in so far as it relates to matters known or which ought

reasonably to have been known by the Subcontractor on or before the date for submission of the
tender.”.
Furthermore, without prejudice to your rights under the Subcontract Agreement to claim for “delay
damages” as stated in your letter reference 2 above, you are reminded that it is a prerequisite under the
Subcontract to provide all information and evidence that you took all reasonable steps to avoid or
mitigate the alleged delays as required under the Subcontract Agreement including evidence or proof of
loss.
Yours faithfully,
