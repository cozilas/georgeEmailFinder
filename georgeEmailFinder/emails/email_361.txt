Subject Testing, Commissioning and Maintenance Access in Tenant Spaces
Cross Ref None
Dear Sir,
With reference to above subject, the Engineer refers to the various base build equipment in the
Tenant spaces that require access by the Contractor for Testing, Commissioning and Maintenance and
advise that for the core and the shell spaces, the various Tenant Fit-Out Contractors (TFOCs) will be
installing new suspended ceilings and other interior finishes, which will potentially impact the
Contractor's access to their installed equipment. To date, the Engineer could not evidence any
coordination efforts being undertaken by the Contractor to identify its access needs from within these
Tenant spaces.
As such, and in line with the Contractor's work coordination responsibility under Specification Section
01 31 13, the Contractor is requested to identify the various equipment that requires Testing,
Commissioning and Maintenance access in the Tenant spaces in order to ensure that the coordination
is done effectively. The Contractor is required to identify all access needs on a floor plan for each
Tenant space, along with their preferred means of access (e .g., 600 x 600 access panel), which can be
issued to the various Tenants to initiate the required coordination . The enclosed schedule provides an
order of priority for such coordination efforts, however, the list is not exhaustive of all Tenant spaces
within the MTB.
The Contractor is therefore requested to expedite the coordination process and provide the required
information/layouts to support the ongoing coordination process.
Yours faithfully
