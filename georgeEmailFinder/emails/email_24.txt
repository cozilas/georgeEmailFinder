Subject:Charges for Manpower Absences
Dear Sir,
With reference to our letter ADXB-LTR-2020-0265 dated 8 November 2020, we have noticed that the
number of workers provided by you on the SWRO Project in Jebel Ali continues to vary on a daily basis,
despite our request for you to keep the numbers of the manpower fixed.
For instance, on 21 November 2020, the number of the provided manpower decreased to 18 nr. instead
of 25 nr. as required (see attached).
As consequence of your abovementioned actions, our daily site operations and our work productivity
continuous to be negatively affected.
As a result, please be informed that a corresponding amount shall be deducted from your monthly
invoice based on the seven (7) absences of your workers.
This is for your information and action!
Yours Faithfully
