Subject Use of Aluminum Composite Panels (ACP}
Dear Sir,
It has been established that there are significant differences between the con.figuration of the ACP
assemblies and the original test data provided by the Contractor. These differences include but not
limited to, variations in the cavity width of the assemblies and the jointing arrangement between
panels.
The use of ACP and associated assemblies fall under the Curtain Walling Specification (074201) which is
a
performance specification. Therefore, it is the Contractor's responsibility to demonstrate such
assemblies meet the requirements of the International Building Code (IBC} 2006, which forms the basis
of the Fire Strategy for MTB.
Section 1407.10.4 of the 2006 version ofthe IBC requires metal composite materials containing plastic to
be tested to NFPA 285 Standard Fire Test Method for Evaluation of Fire Propagation Characteristics of

Exterior Non Load Bearing Wall Bearing Assemblies Containing Combustible Components.
Please provide evidence you have met your contractual obligations with respect to the fire performance
of such assemblies. This evidence shall include but not limited to:
• Identification of the various different configurations of assemblies involving the use of ACP.
• Fire test data from an accredited testing house which demonstrates such configurations do not
adversely affect the overall fire performance of the assemblies in comparison to the criteria
detailed in NFPA 285.
Yours faithfully,
