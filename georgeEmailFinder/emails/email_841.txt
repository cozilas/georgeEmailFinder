Subject: Re: Discharge of contaminated water into sewer network
Dear Sir,
The Contractor acknowledges receipt of the Engineer's letter reference no (1) and responds as follows:

At the outset, the Contractor would like to clarify that the title of letter (1) is misleading. The water that
is
being discharged into the Contractor's own sewer network is condensate water, due to the activation of
the air-conditioning system within the building. The Engineer is well aware of this and therefore the
Contractor cannot understand why the Engineer has opted to describe it as contaminated water.
The Contractor notes that the Engineer in letter (1) has stated that it carried out an investigation into
the
alleged claims made by the Other Contractor (MTL Contractor) and has found that the MTL Contractors
statements to be accurate. However, the Engineer has failed to provide, any evidence of the outcome of
this investigation. The Contractor rejects these unsubstantiated allegations made by the MTL
Contractor,
that the Contractor is responsible for the water that has entered the MTL Contractors works. The
Contractor has carried out its own investigation and has found that none of its personnel have removed
the plug that has caused water to be discharged into the MTL Contractors works.
The Engineer is further aware that the Contractor is removing water from our manholes using tankers.
Furthermore, the Contractor has assisted the MTL Contractor by helping to remove the water from their
network. After removing the water and plugging the interface manhole (ref no 2309), it was found that
water was still present in the MTL Contractor's network. This was communicated to the Engineer's
interface coordinator in order to ensure that no further unsubstantiated claims are received from the
MTL
Contractor in this regard.
We trust the above clarifies the matter. I I ' I
Yours faithfully
