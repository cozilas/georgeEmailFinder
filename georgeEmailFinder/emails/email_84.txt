Subject:Clause 27.1.1: Notice of Claim – Delay Notice No. 262 [post-SAA8]
Availability of Zutec Online Platform
Dear Sirs,
On 20 April 2020, we received your e-mail (ref: 1), informing us that “it is highly likely that Zutec will not
be accessible to the MTB Project after 22 April [2020]” and advised of recommended steps to secure
data.
The following day, on 21 April 2020, we received your letter (ref: 2) in which you confirmed that the
Zutec licence and services would expire on 22 April 2020, and beyond this date, Zutec would not be
accessible / operational for the MTB Project. Your letter also served to re-affirm your earlier
recommendation for us to take whatever steps were necessary to recover all our Project data from
Zutec, including inter alia, CIR, WIR, Asset Tagging, Room Completion and Snagging data, plus associated
tracking logs and attachments.
You further advised that from this point onwards, it is necessary for the Project to revert to processing
the submission of all relevant submittals manually vide document control and supported by excel
trackers and reporting tools; albeit we are required to ensure the same level of reporting to that of the
Zutec system.
However, in our e-mail dated 21 April 2020 [3:02 PM] (ref: 3), we informed you that, despite us trying to
download as much information as possible [given the fact you provided us very little notice], the Zutec
developer had implanted a ‘road block’ by imposing a daily download limit. This severely hampered our
ability to recover our Project data from Zutec in an efficient, expeditious and progressive manner.
We take this opportunity in reminding you that when Zutec was first introduced, various meetings were
held between us and the Employer and culminated in us writing to you on 8 November 2016 (ref: 4), in
which we set out what was mutually agreed upon in relation to the implementation of the Zutec system.
Point 6 of our letter clearly stated that the Employer was to provide us with an offline snapshot of all the
Zutec data, for our records. This was acknowledged by way of your letter dated 27 February 2017 (ref:
5).
Accordingly, we maintain that the Employer had an obligation to provide us a complete set of off-line
date and records, prior to the instigating the closure of the Zutec system and denying us, or limiting, our
access.
Therefore, in light of the various acts of prevention on the part of the Employer, and / or the Employer’s
Personnel and / or the Consultants and / or the Employer’s Other Contractor described above, we
hereby give you notice, pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1, of our right to
claim:
(i)
An extension to the Time for Completion pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c); and
(ii)
An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.1 pursuant to Clause 9.10, or,
in the alternative, damages for breach of contract.
Interim and/or final details of the Time Impacts and adjustments to the Contract Price relating to this
event will be provided in due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.5(a), (b) and (c).
Yours faithfully,
