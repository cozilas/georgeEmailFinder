Subject Flooding and damage to the MTB due to the recent rainfall events in Jan.2020
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence (1) received from the Contractor responding to the
Engineer's correspondence (2) and to the recent attached email correspondence.
• The Contractor appears to convolute their obligations under their Contract with the process
for the Insurance claim . The two are separate and the Contract obligations of the Contractor
notwithstanding the Insurance claim and relevant process remain. Therefore, Clause 24.2.2 is
applicable and not irrelevant as the Contractor stated. Pursuant to this Clause, the Contractor
is responsible for the care of the works and the Contractor shall rectify the loss or damage at
the Contractor's risk and cost. Therefore, the Contractor in parallel with their submitted
Insurance claim and without any instruction being required to be issued, shall proceed with
the rectification of the works.
• The Engineer has responded to the Contractor's letter referenced MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/015220
and the Contractor is referred to correspondence (3).
• The Contractor has not evidenced any prevention or breach of contract by the Employer and
remains responsible for the rectification of the works. As stated above, t he Insurance claim is
to be treated as separate from the Contract obligations that the Cont ractor has.
• The Contractor's obligation to rectify the damaged works and provide the measures to be
implemented t o prevent further damages of the works is not linked with the Engineer's
report. The Contractor is again requested to submit their updated weather plan and address
the Engineer's correspondence (2).
Yours faithfully,
