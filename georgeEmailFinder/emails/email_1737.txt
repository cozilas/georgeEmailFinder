Dear Sir,

The Engineer's Assistant refers to letter reference 1). wherein the Contractor was directed to submit a
quotation for any cost or time impact and subsequently reminded by reference 2). Although the
Contractor failed to respond, Engineer's Instruction reference 3) was issued and followed by reference
4) and 5), confirming the provisions of Sub-Clause 13.2.1 still applied. The last reminder, reference 7),
was due by 25 August 2016.

The Engineer's Assistant must now conclude that the Contractor is unwilling to provide the directed
quotation given that a total period of 511 days have lapsed without submission of a quotation.
Absent compliance with the Engineer's direction, the Engineer is now compelled to complete his assess
ent of the Variation without input from the Contractor.
Yours faithfully,
