Dear Sir,
We write with reference to the enclosed LPO referenced in (2) above and we hereby confirm that we
have already arranged the Fabricator for the Installation of Halfen Channel on your behalf.
Pursuant to the Conditions of Subcontract Agreement Clause 10.3 (Contractorâ€™s Claims), we hereby
confirm our entitlement to deduct such amounts but not limited to the enclosed, from your interim
payments accordingly. The basis of these charges is due to the fact that the works are being carried out
on your behalf, due to your failure to perform your Subcontract obligations.
In addition, we shall back charge any amount that falls under your responsibility in accordance to Clause
12.12.4 (Other Contractors and Other Subcontractors), whereby you are liable to the Contractor for any
claim by the Employer, other Contractors or other Subcontractors for the costs arising out of your failure
to perform your obligations under the Subcontract.
This is for your information and future reference.
Yours Faithfully,
Subject: Engineer's Overdue Response to the Contractor's Request for Confirmation of

Variation Order for RFEI/0401/0592- Wet and Damp Area
Dear Sir,
The Contractor refers to the letters reference (1) and (2) above, whereby the Contractor has requested,
pursuant to Sub-Clause 20.1.4 (b) [Right to Vary] of the Conditions of Contract, that the Engineer
confirms
that the information, comments, clarifications and instructions, contained in the Engineer's response to
RFEI/0401/0592 and 'Wet and Damp Area Site Walk Report', constitute a formal Variation Order. The
Contractor records that, as of the date of this letter, the Engineer has failed to provide the necessary
confirmation of Variation or to issue an Engineer's instruction and revised Drawings and/or Specification
pursuant to Sub-Clauses 11.3.3 and 20.1.1 (a) of the Conditions of Contract.
The Contractor is currently progressing with the works as per the current IFC information and approved
shop drawings. The Contractor hereby notifies the Engineer that should the Engineer now issue an
instruction to implement any of the changes requested in RFEI/0401/0592 and/or 'Wet and Damp Area
Site Walk Report', there will be abortive works. It should be noted that the ROMs reference (3} and (4)
currently do not include the estimated cost for the abortive works. The Engineer/Employer shall be
responsible for any delays or disruptions to the Works, and the costs of any abortive works, as a result of
the Engineer's failure to provide the necessary confirmation of Variation or to issue an Engineer's
instruction and revised Drawings and/or Specification pursuant to Sub-Clauses 11.3.3 and 20.1.1 (a) of
the
Conditions of Contract, in a timely manner.
Yours faithfully,
