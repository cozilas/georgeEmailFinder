Subject: Contractor’s Attendance in Meetings
Dear Sir
We note with concern the lack of attendance by the Contractor’s personenel at weekly meetings and for
the past three weeks. Despite the engineer facilitating the latest meeting on 8 april 2020 via webex and
remotely the Contractor still failed to participate.
We also record that the contractor has failed to forward the meeting presentation as requested by the
engineer for the status of fiber structured cabling network.
The contractor’s non-attendance to meeting is not acceptable and is contrary to the contractor’s
contractual obligations. The contractor shall submit the requested presentation and attend all weekly
meetings along with their subcontractor(s) and moving forward.

Yours faithfully
