Subject: RE: Notice of Delay- Bottom Last Panel for Car Park Link Bridge (CPLB)
Dear Sir,
Further to the Subcontractor's letter reference (1), please find attached the response received from the
Other Subcontractor Gulf Precast Company LLC (Gulf Precast) in respect of the alleged misalignment of
the concrete slab edge of the CPLB.
Gulf Precast refutes the Subcontractor's claim and confirms that the slab edges of the CPLB were
executed
within the permitted tolerance limits. Gulf Precast further affirms that the concrete slab was executed
more than fourteen months ago and therefore is surprised about the Subcontractor's delayed allegation

that the edge is 'out of tolerance'. The Contractor concurs with Gulf Precast and confirms that it will not
accept any liability vis-a-vis any delay incurred by the Subcontractor in the completion of the CPLB
derived
from its late notification of this issue.
For the record, the Contractor regrets the Subcontractor's lack of cooperative approach in respect of
notifying the parties in advance, coordinating with Other Subcontractors, producing the sketches
requested by the Contractor and/or assisting in proposing a technical solution to this problem.
Notwithstanding the above and further to the joint survey undertaken between the Contractor, the
Subcontractor and Gulf Precast, the Subcontractor is requested to consult with Gulf Precast and assist
the
Contractor in finding a satisfactory solution to this issue.
Yours faithfully,
