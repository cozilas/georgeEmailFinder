Subject: Submission of consolidated list of the outstanding doors issues for clarification/confirmation by
the Engineer
Dear Sir,
Further to our letter referenced (1) and the email correspondences enclosed, we hereby submit as per
your request the consolidated list of the outstanding doors issues which require clarification and/or
confirmation by the Engineer.
We reiterate that many issues remain unresolved including discrepancies between the Door Schedules
and the SACS Schedules, as well as matters relating to fire life safety interface requirements. Therefore,
the enclosed consolidated list has been prepared as a comprehensive schedule of issues, incorporating
all of the latest comments, documents etc. issued by the Engineer and relates to the doors that remain
outstanding.
The Engineer is kindly requested to use the enclosed list of doors to confirm and/or clarify the
information and officially issue it back to us by confirming and/or amending it respectively as per the
Employerâ€™s latest requirements.
Once we receive the confirmation as discussed above and all technical issues are resolved, we will
continue to work together to identify and endeavour to agree which changes (if any) have been
subsumed by Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8.
This is for your information, records and urgent action.
Yours faithfully,
