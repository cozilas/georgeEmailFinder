Dear Sir,
This is a direction under Sub-Clause 13.2.1 for the Contractor to submit a quotation that shall include
both price and any potential time impact for a proposed Variation in relation to a proposed amendment
to the Scope requirements associated with Tunnel Segment Repair, as referenced in Volume 7, SubClause 13.3.3.15 c).

The above referenced Employer's Requirement is deleted in its entirety and amended as follows :
Categories of segment defects are defined as minor, medium and major, as shown in the table below:
i-

Minor defects can be accepted without repair.

iiMedium defects can be repaired only after the detailed method statement has been given a
SONO from the Engineer. This does not release the Contractor from his obligations to satisfy the
Employer's Requirements, including but not limited to Volume 7, Clause 12.3.1.1 Precast concrete
segmental linings shall be of waterproofing class 1.
iiiWhere a major defect occurs prior to the final placement of the relevant segment in the tunnel
it shall be rejected.
iv-

All defects in the segment which will be in contact with the gasket shall be repaired.

Yours faithfully,
