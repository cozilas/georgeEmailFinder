Subject:Re: Site observation report prior to screed thickness casted by TCAJV for revolving door areas â€“
CP Level 2.0 Zone 01 and 02

Dear Sir,
We are in receipt of your letter reference (1) above, wherein you informed us that the screed casted by
us at the areas adjacent to the revolving doors zone 1 and 2 in CP L2.0, allegedly does not meet the
required thickness.
Please be informed that the works for MEP conduits are ongoing in the areas mentioned in your letter.
Therefore, once these works are completed and after appropriate action is taken by us, we will notify
you to proceed with your remaining works accordingly.
This is for your information and records.
Yours faithfully,
