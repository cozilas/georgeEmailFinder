Subject:Post SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0189
Delays to the Processing of Re-Entry Permit / NOCs and Activities of Others Affecting Finalisation of
Snagging, De-Snagging and T&C Activities to L2.0 (as of 15 December 2019)
Dear Sirs,
We refer to your letter ref: (1) following issuance of E-Notice No. 0189 (ref: 2) in which you allege that as
a result of us re-entering the noted spaces we have disrupted the works of the Employer’s Other
Contractors and that you “do not consider that the submitted E-Notice has any merit”.
For the reasons comprehensively set out in Annex A to letter (2) and recorded below, we disagree.
Firstly, for the record, your comment on us allegedly disrupting the works of Other Contractors is a
statement of opinion and you have failed to provide any substantiation to support this statement.
Secondly, while you acknowledge in your letter (ref: 1) that you have processed re-entry permits with a
turn-around time of 3 working days “on average”, this is clearly not the case for all of the permits listed
in Table 1 to Annex A of E-Notice No. 0189 (ref: 2); and as such represents act(s) of prevention.
In view of this, then we maintain all our rights under the provision of Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses
16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to the Time
for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event described in letter ref: (2).
Yours faithfully,
