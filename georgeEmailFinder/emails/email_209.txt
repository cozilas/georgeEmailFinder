Subject Contractor Laydown Areas
Dear Sir,
We refer to correspondence {1) concerning the captioned subject and reiterate our request for the
Contractor to assess the effective usage of its Subcontractors' laydown areas with the aim of
improving and optimizing its current utilization. Furthermore, the Contractor is urged to immediately
commence clearing off-site the scrap/non-usable material stored at scattered areas across the site,
and most importantly those bulk quantities residing at the East Midfield that are currently obstructing
the construction of the permanent road by the Airside Contractor for ADNOC's usage. These
obstructions have to be cleared by 31 January 2020.
The Contractor is required to address the above and treat this as a matter of urgency and to confirm
their course of actions and plans for addressing this issue.
Yours faithfully,
