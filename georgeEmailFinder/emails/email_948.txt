Subject:
Notification of Fibrex Claim- Removal of GRC Panels due to AI Ghurair's
Incorrect Surveys to Fins
Dear Sir,
Following our letter reference (1) above and numerous previous correspondences referenced therein
regarding the “Removal & Reinstallation of GRC Slab Edge Panels” by M/S Fibrex due to your incorrect
surveys, we hereby enclose M/S Fibrex updated claim that will be backcharged to your account
accordingly pursuant to Clause 10.3 [Contractor’s Claim].
Furthermore, we record your refusal to accept this backcharge as stated in your previous
correspondences, which evidently has not yet been substantiated by you. Consequently, we are taking
this opportunity to highlight once again, that to date you have failed to submit any detailed response to
substantiate your position in respect to your refusal. We point out once more that all previous letters
received from you are very generic and are lacking of any reference to the Subcontract Conditions.
In light of the above, we hereby enclose M/S Fibrex claim which is self-explanatory. To be more specific
M/S Fibrex claim consists of Part A - Removal & Reinstallation (Attachment 1) and Part B - Idle
Manpower (Attachment 2) which is AED 356,760.50 and AED 437,523.25 respectively, totaling to AED
794,283.75 which will be backcharged to you accordingly.
This is for your utmost attention, information and records.
Yours faithfully,
