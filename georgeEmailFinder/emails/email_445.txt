- as at 24 April 2019

Dear Sir
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’), in consideration that the events and / or circumstances described herein
may cause delay [and disruption] to the Works and seek your swift resolution of the same.
The Event(s):
Between 7 November 2018 and 24 March 2019, we submitted 18 Submittals (consisting of Document
Submittals, O&M Manuals, Training Manuals and Material Submittals, plus Submittals for Spare Parts,
Tools and Extra Materials), in respect of the Security Access Control System (SACS), for your review and
approval, in the manner and on the dates recorded in Annex A hereto.
Article 1.3 of Specification Section 013300 ‘Submittal Procedures’ governs the processing time by which
you are contractually obligated to respond to our submittals. On the basis that each of the SACS
Submittals listed in Annex A are shown to be either Rev. 00 or Rev. 1, then these ought to have been
responded to by the Engineer 21 and 14 calendar days later. However, the information recorded in
Annex A shows that at the cut-off date associated with this E-Notice (24 April 2019), with the exception
of 1 submittal (item 17), you exceeded the review periods expressly stipulated in the Contract:
Specifically, 11 responses were late by upwards of 80 calendar days (items 3 – 6, 10, 12 – 16, and 18),
while your response to 6 other submittals (items 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 11) are still pending.
The Security Access Control System Subcontractor, ATLAS, has written on this event also, notifying us of
the right to claim the additional time and cost impacts arising therefrom; a copy of their letters ref: (2)
and (3) above are attached for your information and reference.
Potential Impact:
Your approval of the various SACS Submittals reflected in Annex A is essential in enabling us obtain the
Building Completion Certificate (BCC). This is critical to the achievement of Milestone No. MS09B.
Consequently, your prolonged review and approval of the various SACS Submittals shown in Annex A,
has a potential to impact our ability to achieve Substantial Completion.
Action Required:
While we acknowledge receipt of your responses to 12 out of 18 Submittals listed in Annex A hereto, we
request your prompt review of the remaining 6 Submittals (items 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 11) which are still
pending action on your part, in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
Yours faithfully,
