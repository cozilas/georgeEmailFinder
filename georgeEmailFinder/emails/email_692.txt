Dear Sir,
In reference to the numerous correspondences over the past eight weeks (see attachments), whereby
we have repeatedly requested information in regards to your material delivery status and the
progression of your works, we hereby formally place on record our concern regarding your ability to
progress the Subcontract works expeditiously and therefore achieve the completion dates as set out in
the agreed construction schedule (2).
We take this opportunity to remind you of your obligations as set out under the Subcontract - Clause
8.1.2 [Subcontractors Obligations]. Moreover, Subcontract Clause 16.1.1 [Commencement of

expedition and without delay, and should neither delay nor adversely affect the performance of TCAJV
or other subcontractors.
In view of the above, you are hereby instructed pursuant to Clause 11.3 [Instructions of the Contractor]
to submit an Action Plan within three (3) days from the receipt of this letter, detailing your proposed
mitigation measures concerning the procurement of all outstanding materials. In addition to the above,

the action plan should detail proposed manpower levels (histogram) and working arrangements (i.e.
extended working hours), highlighting your commitment to achieve the agreed completion dates
pursuant to clause 16.4 [Recovery of delays].
Please note that any delays, costs, losses and/or expenses incurred by us and/or Other Subcontractor/s
arising as a result of the incurred delays shall be at your risk and recovered from your account in
accordance with Subcontract clauses 10.3[Contractor’s Claims], 16.6.1 [Delay Damages] and other
relevant clauses.
This is for your immediate action and attention.

Yours faithfully,
