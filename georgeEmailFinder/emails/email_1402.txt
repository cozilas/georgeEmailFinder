Dear Sir,
We refer to the above referenced letter regarding SAR approvals for Designer Verif ication Engineer for
Provisional Sum Works. As outlined in the rejection of the Contractor's SAR submissions, the Engineer's
Assistant reiterates that the Designer Verification Engineer for Provisional Sum Works forms part of the
Contractor's Lump Sum as outlined below in Volume 2 (Part 2), Sub-Clause 9.1.2.5 f ii H.

" The Design Verification Engineer's scope of work will apply to all defined works within the Accepted
Contract Amount, covering both the Lump Sum and the Provisional Sum portions of the Accepted
Contract Amount. The Contractor's Design Verification Engineer will be expected to exercise the same
professional standards across all aspects of the works under the Contract. The Accepted Contract
Amount includes the DVE's full scope of work which includes checking and certifying the provisional sum
elements of the Works."

Yours faithfully,
