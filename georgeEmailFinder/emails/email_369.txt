We write with reference to the above correspondence (1) in relation to RFVO (3) re lated to recovery
of overhead and profit and attendances due to the omission of Defined Provisional Sum for t he Hotel
Fit Out.
The Contractor's request for a Variation Order has been rejected and detailed reasons based upon the
Contract Clauses have been provided via correspondence (2). The Contractor's interpretation of the
"true meaning" of the Contract is rejected and the Engineer reiterates its position.
The Engineer is not required to "determine" the issue as the Contractor has not submitted a Claim
pursuant to Clause 27.1 of the Conditions of Contract.
Yours f aithfully,
Dear Sir,
(1} MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/011852 dated OS November 2017
(2) MTC-CMA-TCA-0401-LTR-08073 dated 22 October 2017
We write with reference to correspondence (1} regarding the recovery of Overhead, Profit and
Attendance due to the Omission of the Defined Provisional Sum for Hotel Fit Out.
The Engineer reiterates its contractual position conveyed to the Contractor vide correspondence (2).
Furthermore the Contractor is referred to Clause 9.5 (Schedule 1, Contract Particula rs) wherein is
provided that the Contract shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
Emirate of Abu Dhabi and the federa l laws of the United Arab Emirates.
We note the Contractor's request for a meeting to discuss "the dispute" and we record that the
Contractor has not submitted a Claim in accordance with the Contract regarding this matter and also, in
the last paragraph of correspondence (1), the Contractor erroneously refers to letter (ref.

MTB/TCA/ AECOM/L/011503) which is not related to the Omission of the Defined Provisional Sum for
the
Hotel Fit Out.
In light of the above, the Engineer believes the requirements of the Contract are explicit.
Please find attached Contractor's Instruction Ref: Cl/00310 which is self-explanatory.
Pursuant to our letters referenced from (3) to (9) above, you are hereby instructed, pursuant to Clause
11.3 to stop with immediate effect, the works that has been omitted from your scope of works in
accordance with Clause 22.2.4 & 20 of the Conditions of Subcontract as detailed in the attached Cl.
Please note that these omitted works has been taken over by the JV and we will be advising you of
further
details in due course.
This is for your strict compliance and should you have queries, please do not hesitate to contact us.
