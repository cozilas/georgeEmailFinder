Dear Sir

Further to the Contractor’s letter referenced item 1 we would like to add the following clarification in
support of our position regarding the commencement date of the “Fixed Amount Period.”

It has come to our attention after the issue of the response in item 1 above that Tender Bulletin nr 11
that reduced the “Fixed Amount Period,” to 12 from 24 months contained revised wording that clarifies
the contractual intent of this subject. Item 1 of the Bulletin as stated was for the following:

Clause 2.2.1 of the Revised Material Cost Adjustment Procedure stated the following:

This clearly clarifies the intent of the Contract was for the first twelve months to be the Fixed Amount
Period and not to start on a date long before Project commencement.

We trust this clarifies the situation that the date inserted in the Contract was included in error and
should not be used as the commencement date in the calculation of the material price fluctuation.

Yours faithfully,
