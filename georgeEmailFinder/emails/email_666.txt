Notice to Correct - Delays in the Completion of LOD500 BIM Models

Dear Sir,
Further to the above referenced correspondence, issued in relation to your failure to submit the
required LOD500 BIM deliverables in a timely manner, we record that you have also been unable to
meet the new planned dates for the submission of the overdue models.
You are therefore required to confirm your final submission dates for each deliverable concerning your
LOD500 BIM model. Please be advised that these dates will be final and will not allow for any further
slippage.
Considering the significant delays being incurred in the completion of your LOD 500 BIM model, and
pursuant to Sub-Clause 22.1 of the Conditions of Subcontract, you are hereby instructed to make good
your failure, allocate sufficient resources to the completion of your BIM deliverables and adhere to the
deadlines agreed with us. Should you continue to fail to meet the milestones fixed for your BIM
submissions, please be notified that we may exercise our rights under Sub-Clause 22.2.4 of the
Conditions of Subcontract, complete your remaining BIM scope and deduct all associated costs from
monies due, or to become due, to you. For the sake of clarity, the amount to be charged to your account
will be built-up on the basis of our policy for “Back-Charge Rates for BIM & HSE Service”.

Pursuant to Sub-Clause 10.3 [Contractor’s Claims] and Sub-Clause 16.6 [Delay Damages] of the
Conditions of Subcontract, please be notified that our rights under these Clauses are hereby reserved.
Yours faithfully,
