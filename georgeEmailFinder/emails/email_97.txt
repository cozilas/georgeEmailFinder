Subject:SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0255
UAE Governmental Authority Edict – Notice from Abu Dhabi Municipality Department of
Transport – 11 April 2020 – Restriction of Worker Movement
Dear Sirs,
We refer to our letters to the Employer including without limitation letters ref: (1) and (2) and our
subsequent letters ref: (3) and (4) notifying you of the ramifications on the Project consequent on the
UAE Governmental Authorities’ edicts associated with the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
During the early hours of Saturday 11 April 2020, we received a Notice from Abu Dhabi Municipality –
Department of Municipalities and Transport, informing us as well as other companies, that although
companies are allowed to transfer workers within the Abu Dhabi areas: Abu Dhabi, Al Ain and Al Dharfa;
in order to curb the spread of COVID-19, “it is prohibited to transfer workers from Abu Dhabi to other
Emirates and vice versa (from other Emirates to Abu Dhabi Emirates)” with “immediate effect”.
This particular edict had a detrimental impact on our progress and that of our subcontractors, resulting
in a significant drop in manpower levels on the day the restrictions on travelling between emirates came
into force. This is illustrated by the following comparison between the subcontract manpower numbers
recorded on 7 April 2020 and those recorded on Saturday 11 April 2020 (refer to Table 1):

TOTAL: 1,267 351
The information recorded in Table 1 serves to demonstrate a 72.3 % drop in subcontract personnel
levels between 7 April 2020 [1,267 persons] to 21 April 2020 [351 persons], i.e. 916 persons less.
We further note that the above figures do not take account to the delay and disruption caused to other
resources as the police restrictions enforced at the border between Dubai and Abu Dhabi on 21 April
2020 resulted in major traffic jams, severely impacting our own site personnel and site office staff also.
in summary, we hereby notify you pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and
Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’) that the various events and circumstances described and detailed above,
have delayed and disrupted the Works and invariably will critically delay the Time for Completion.
Yours faithfully,
