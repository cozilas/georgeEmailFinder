Subject Handed Over MEP Services (AMC Serving and Passing Through MEP Services)
Damaged I Removed by Other Contractors
Dear Sir,
Further to the above referenced letter the Engineer would like to clarify and record that the MEP
services serving and passing through the AMC area has not been handed over to the Employer and
remain the responsibility of the Contractor under its scope until a Taking Over Certificate is issued by
the Employer for the substantial completion of the works.
The Engineer has received the Contractor's damage report unofficially via email on 12 March 2018
with the understanding of an official submission. This will enable us to notify the responsible
Contractor accordingly. We confirm that the said advance damage report copy received is currently
being reviewed.
The Engineer will do the necessary to secure the coordination between the Contractor and ARCO
Interiors {Fit Out Contractor) to resolve and finalize the situation.
The Contractor is therefore requested to submit the official damage report with all associated costs.

Subject Shop Drawings Classification and As-Built Drawings Statistics
Dear Sir,
Please be informed that the content of the submitted Transmittal (1) has been rejected by the
Employer for the following reasons which have been communicated to the Contractor via Email and
meetings:
1. In some cases, the drawings categorization is misleading resulting in incorrect allocation (AsBuilt
vs . Shop Drawings).
2. Some drawings sets have not been produced as part of the Shop Drawings but are required as
As-Built (e.g GA plans, sections, elevations).
3. Drawings scales missing from drawings register.
In addition to the above, the Contractor shall submit the final As-Built register based on the agreed
categories which have been sent to the Contractor on 10 January 2018 through El-722 (2) for approval.
Yours faithfully
