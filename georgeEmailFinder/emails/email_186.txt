Dear Sir,
We refer to our letter (1) following issuance of our E-Notice Nos. 0088 (2) and 0149 (3), in which we
reminded you that we are being prevented from completing the installation of security screening
equipment and security systems devices due to the activities of the Employer's Fit Out Contractor(s).
On the basis the affected areas will not be made available to us to allow the installation of t he various
items of equipment prior to the scheduled completion dates, we suggested that you either allow us to
defer installation until the defects liability period or we free issue the equipment for the Employer to
install directly. However, our letter (1) and hence this suggestion was either overlooked or ignored.
Consequently your inactivity coupled with the activities of the Employer's Other [Fit -Out] Contract or(s)
are continuing to prevent us from completing the installations of the security screening equipment and
security systems devices and accordingly the events subject to our E-Notice Nos. 0088 and 0149 (letters
ref: 2 and 3) are continuing to have an impact on our progress and will delay the Time for Completion.
In order to resolve matters, we respectfully suggest that you issue us with an Engineer's Instruction that
either (1) deletes the affected elements of the secu rity screening equipment installations and security
systems devices (Duress Alarm, Baggage Labelling and Tracking System, and Cameras) from our scope of
Works, or (2) agrees to delay the installation the security and screen ing equipment unt il post -BCC.
Please issue such instruction forthwith in confirmation your preferred way forwards.
Meanwhile, we continue to reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract
Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension
to the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
Yours faithfully,
