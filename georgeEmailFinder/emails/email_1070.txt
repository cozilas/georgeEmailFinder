Dear Sir,
With reference to the above subject, we write to inform about the Employer’s determination of the
exchange rate related to RFVO’s and consequently Variations Orders. Please be informed that the
Engineer has issued its final determination of the exchange rate for all RFVO submissions, which has
been assessed at 4.30 AED/€ by the Employer.
In view of the above, please be informed that the Employer’s assessment was based on your submitted
RFVO’s, taking into consideration your relevant substantiations respectively, provided therein.
In the meantime, in the absence of the issuance of the pending Variation Orders from the Engineer and
as a gesture of good will, we had proceeded with the release of on-account payments, as shown below:

Remarks

The above figures clearly show that we have been assisting you financially by certifying more than what
you have been actually applying for.
Please be informed that your intention to stop the works due to the foregoing has come to our
attention. In the event whereby the aforementioned proves to be truthful and you indeed intend to stop
the works, then you will be in default as per Clause 22.2 [Termination by Contractor for Subcontractor
Default] and you will be held fully responsible for breach of contract. Consequently, you will be held fully
responsible for the consequences arising out of such potential breaches and the associated knock-on
effects to the Contractor’s ability to administer its works under the Contract with the Employer. We put
on record the effects that may arise out of potentially multiple breaches of the Subcontract provisions
as per Clause 22.2.2 (c), (d), (f), (g) & (i) [Termination by Contractor for Subcontractor Default].

Furthermore, your attention is brought to Clauses 8 [Subcontractor’s Obligations], 8.1.1, 8.1.2, 8.1.3 and
8.1.4 [Reliance upon Subcontractor] and specifically to Clause 8.1.3 which states the following:
“The Subcontractor's duties, obligations and responsibilities under and in connection with the
Subcontract, and the Subcontractor's liability to the Contractor for the consequences of any breach of
the Subcontract, negligence or other default shall in no way be excused, waived, negated or diminished
by:
(a) any process of review, checking, inspection, examination, testing, monitoring or supervision which
may be carried out by the Contractor, the Contractor's Personnel, the Contractor's Affiliates, other
Consultants or any other persons appointed or authorised by the Contractor to carry out such tasks; or
(b) any acknowledgement, encouragement, approval or consent, or any comment, proposal, request,
notice, decision, direction, instruction or certificate which might be made, given or issued by the
Contractor or any of the aforementioned persons during the carrying out or as a consequence of such
tasks or on the recommendation or advice of the Subcontractor”.
In addition to the above, you are reminded that you are obligated to continue with the works pursuant
to the signed Collateral Warranty and Subcontract Clauses 12.9.3 [Subcontracting] and all relevant
provisions under Clause 8 [Subcontractor May Not Terminate Or Discontinue] Schedule 7- Part 1
[Subcontractor Collateral Warranty].
Furthermore, please refer to the Conditions of Contract Clause 20.3.11 [Variation Procedure] which
state “The Subcontractor shall not be entitled to defer, delay or suspend the carrying out of any of the
Subcontract Works (including any aspects and/or elements of the Subcontract Works which may be
affected by the Value Engineering Proposal or proposed Variation) whilst the Contractor considers
and/or the Parties discuss and endeavour to agree the Subcontractors proposals.”
Consequently, be informed that any delays, costs, claims, losses and/or expenses and the like incurred
by us and/or Other Sub-Contractors arising as a result of your failure to proceed with the works
expeditiously and without delay will be solely your responsibility as per the Subcontract Agreement
Clauses including but not limited to 10.3 [Contractors Claims], 12.12.4 [Other Contractors and other
Subcontractors] and 16.6 [Delay Damages].
This is for your immediate attention, compliance and further action.
Yours faithfully,
