Dear Sir,

We refer to letter reference 1) above, and wish to comment as follow:

The assertion you made in your letter is contradicting the intent as set out in the Employer Requirement
at Volume 6, Sub-Clause 10.5.1.2.

The Engineer's Assistant is of the opinion that the Contractor is incorrectly citing Sub-Clause 10.5.1.2 (e)
to support his assertion. Sub-Clause 10.5.1.2 (e) is a provision meant for a limited usage, and cannot be
construed as a reference for a general application.

Sub-Clause 10.5.1.2 (e):

'The maximum distance between cross-passageways may be increased, in special cases and subject to
approval by Civil Defense, by up to 500m in accordance with the European TS/ for railway tunnels (TS/
SRT) if it can be demonstrated by engineering analysis that evacuation of the maximum train capacity
load (1.200p) into the non-incident tunnel can be achieved under tenable conditions and that the
resulting risk for passengers would be acceptable and as low as reasonably practicable. The
engineering..."

Instead, the Contractor shall refer to Sub-Clause 10.5.1.2 (d) for the requ.irement to design the works .
Sub-Clause 10.5.1.2 (d):
"In accordance with NFPA 130, cross-passageways shall be provided in tunnel sections where they are
required at a maximum distance of 244 m between each other or to another access towards a point of
safety (evacuation shaft in tunnel or at a station end, tunnel portal)."

As Sub-Clause 10.5.1.2 (e) required a specific approval by Civil Defense, which the Sub-Clause 10.5.1.2
(d) doesn't, and with the stipulation that this sub-clause is only applicable in special cases, the
Contractor's assertion based on Sub-Clause 10.5.1.2 (e) has no basis.
Yours faithfully,
