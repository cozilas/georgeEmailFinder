Subject: Chairman's Meeting
Dear Sirs,
We refer to the above letters and their selective recording of a number of issues raised at the
Chairman's Meetings. We regret we must refute the closing statement to each of these letters as
they do not accurately reflect the discussions at the meeting: rather they are a series of notes and
an attachment that document certain aspects of the dialogues that took place. For the avoidance
of any doubt, we too have our own record of certain discussions that ensued.
We respectfully suggest that as you have now introduced a scribe into your team of attendees, if it
is your intention that a fair and reasonable record of the proceedings at the Chairman's Meeting is
made, then you either issue a fully detailed set of minutes of the whole of the meeting or that you
issue a list of agreed action points.
Meanwhile we reiterate that insofar as our Works are not being impacted by the prevention issues
that have been and continue to be contractually recorded, we are on target to ensure the
Completion Date is met.
Yours faithfully
