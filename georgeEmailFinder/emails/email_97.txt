BCC NOCs for Piers 1 and 3 – Delays to ADCD and ADM Inspections
Dear Sir,
It has come to our attention that the final inspections which were recently undertaken by ADCD and
ADM associated with the BCC NOCs for Piers 1 and 3, have been affected by a series of events and
circumstances. These include but are not necessarily limited to those summarised below:
•
Problems associated with the granting of access into CDP portal for ADCD inspector.
•
Technical issued relating to ADM’s request to implement the inspection remotely [due to the
coronavirus] and securing a visual contact between our site engineers and the ADM inspector.
•
The inspection to Pier 3 was planned to be conducted simultaneously with Pier 1, but due to
issues related to ADM inspection centre, the inspection was postponed from Wednesday to Sunday.
However, the inspection was subsequently cancelled due to a number of obstacles.
Accordingly, we hereby notify you pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 that
the various matters highlighted above constitute acts of prevention and/or breaches of Contract on the
part of the Employer/Employer’s Personnel/Consultants giving rise of our right to claim:
(i)
An extension to the Time for Completion pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c); and
(ii)
An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.2 pursuant to Clause 9.10, or,
in the alternative, damages for breach of Contract.
Interim and/or final details of the associated time impacts and adjustment to the Contract Price will be
provided in due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.5 (a), (b) and (c).
Yours faithfully,
