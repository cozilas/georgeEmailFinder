Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence (1) and we reject the Contractor's allegations in their
entirety. The lCD was created in coordination with the Contractor's MSI team and the Airside Contractor
under the Engineer's management and supervision. Therefore, resubmitting this document requires
additional coordination under the same procedure in order to conclude the issue pertaining to mapping
the VDGS units with the PCA units associated to each parking center-line.
The Engineer has not requested the Contractor to lead the process nor to establish the coordination
sessions. On the contrary, the Engineer has always coordinated the integration requirements between
the Contractors.
The Engineer vide correspondence (2) above, has shared with the Contractor the code and as per the
usual project process. The Contractor was further informed that additional coordination is required in
order to finalize this lCD and again to resubmit it. The resubmission process requires both Contractors to
update the lCD and sign it off, thus the responsible contractor shall submit it officially for review and
approval.
We remind you that this process is already applied therefore your statement that it is "surprising" for
you to provide input on the document and the comment before the lCD gets resubmitted is unfounded.
The Contractor is hereby required to maintain its efforts focused on mitigating delays and progressing
t he timely completion of the interfaces requirements with other packages including the airside systems
as required by Contract.
Yours faithfully,
