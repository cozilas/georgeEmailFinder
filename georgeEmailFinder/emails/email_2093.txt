Dear Sir,
In Contractor's letter referenced at item 5 above, it is stated that there was to be a discussion between
respective Contractor and Qatar Rail Project Directors . As both referenced people Â·have returned from
vacation could Contractor confirm as to the holding of the meeting and provide a response as to any
agreed outcome.

In the Engineer's Assistant's letter, referenced at item 5 above, Contractor was to provide a fully
detailed cost analysis by 27 July 2015. It is acknowledged that Contractor requested additional time for
that response as referenced in item 6 above, however, the Engineer's Assistant has yet to be informed
as to whether a discussion has been held between Contractor and Qatar Rail Project Directors, and as to
when Contractor would then submit their fully detailed pricing analysis .

As time is of the essence on this issue of Cross Passage optimization, and given that the original 13.1.1.
Instruction was issued 24 March 2015, Contractor is to immediately consider the requirements of the
Instruction and provide a detailed submission of the price savings associated with the potential
reduction of twenty (20) passages as per the technical assessment stated within the 13.1.1 Instruction.

Contractor's submission is required within (but no later than) seven days from receipt of this letter.
Welook forward to your positive focus and response.

Yours faithfully,
