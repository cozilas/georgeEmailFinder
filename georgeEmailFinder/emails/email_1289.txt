Dear Sir,
Further to our letter referenced above (1) and your subsequent correspondence (2) RE: TO M/S NAFFCO
- Updated Pending Materials Log January 3 2018, we hereby write to record our concern over your
failure to fulfil your contractual obligation with regards to the procurement and installation of the
AWW-02 access panels in a timely manner. We draw your attention to the above correspondence 1)
with particular reference to the Package Delineation Plan which clearly highlights the inclusion of
aforementioned access panel(s).
Therefore, we hereby issue a “Notice of Correct” in accordance with the Conditions of Subcontract,
Clause 22.1 which states that:
•
“If the Subcontractor fails to carry out any obligation under the Subcontract, the Contractor may
by notice require the Subcontractor to make good the failure and to remedy it within a specified
reasonable period.."
Accordingly, you are hereby instructed to correct the above to the satisfaction of the Contractor within
fourteen (14) days from receipt of this letter. In addition, it is noted that any delays, costs, losses and/or
expenses incurred by us and/or other Subcontractor(s) arising as a result of the above delays shall be at
your risk and recovered from your account in accordance with the Subcontract clauses 10.3, 16.4 and
16.6.1.
Should you fail to fulfil your contractual obligations following the elapse of this ‘notice of correct’, a
further review of your performance will be undertaken and you will be notified of our decision to
appoint a third party to undertake the aforementioned works, and thus reimbursing the cost thereof
from your account.
This is for your utmost attention and immediate action.
Yours faithfully,
