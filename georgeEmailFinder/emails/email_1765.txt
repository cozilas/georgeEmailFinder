Dear Sir,

Following receipt of your letter reference 1) above wherein the Engineer’s Assistant requested
confirmation of the amounts proposed as full and final settlement for the Value Engineering proposals
put forward by the Contractor, the Contractor responded through letter reference 2) rejecting the
amount tabled by the Engineer’s Assistant for the Ras Bu Abboud VE as full and final settlement.

Nevertheless, in an effort to keep the Project moving forward, the Contractor will hereby accept the
amounts quoted within said letter as adequate compensation solely for the civil and abortive
components of the instructed works.

In accepting these proposed figures, the Contractor explicitly reserves its right for further payment
resulting from the financial savings associated with the reductions in the cost of the Electromechanical
(MEP) works, the Architectural works, as well as any future savings resulting from the reduced costs of
operating and maintaining the Works.

The breakdown of the Engineer’s Assistant’s figure for Ras Bu Abboud into appropriate payment
milestones as attached to letter reference 2) is still applicable. The Contractor is preparing a similar
breakdown of the milestones relating to the 3/2 level VE proposal which will be submitted shortly.

Yours faithfully,
