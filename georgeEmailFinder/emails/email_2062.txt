Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to letter reference 1) whereby a detailed cost estimate was submitted for the
subject works . However, subsequent to the submission, a workshop was organized with the
Representatives of the Engineer's Assistant to discuss the way forward. Based on the discussions, the
Contractor subm its a revised cost estimate of QAR 45,998. 1O for the construction of future Subway
Stub Connection for Joaan Station to Al Sadd Mall Pedestrian Underpass. The Contractor has not been
able to identify any additional design costs and no information has been provided by the Lead Designer
to date. As such, the Contractor believes that there will be no additional design cost associated with this
work however it reserves its rights under the Contract.

Yours faithfully,
