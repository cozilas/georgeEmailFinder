Subject OTIS's ongoing lack of performance - Notice pursuant to Clause 12.10.1 of the
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to letter (1) regarding your Subcontractor's (OTIS) lack of performance and
continuous shortfalls in progress.
The Contractor has identified that the reason for its Subcontractor's underperformance is related to
inadequate site management (Construction Managers and Supervisors) as well as qualified site
personnel. The Contractor has committed that its Subcontractor in order to rectify its deficiencies shall
provide an additional QA/QC Manager and Construction Manager (in early March), 6 adjusters,
additional erectors for the elevators and 10 more mechanics for the escalator team (ref. enclosed email
1).
lt is the Employer's and the Engineer's position that the above measures are not adequate in order to
address the adverse implications to the Programme of Works which have been created as a result of
your Subcontractor. The extent of the slippage of your Subcontractor's works is shown at the table
below:
In light of the above, and as demonstrated in the enclosed Programme Update, the works on site are at
risk and further delays will occur as a result of OTIS's underperformance. The Contractor is hereby given
notice pursuant to Clause 12.10.1 of the Conditions of Contract to immediately rectify its
Subcontractor's performance.
Yours faithfully,
