Dear Sir,
Further to Contractor's letter reference M006-GDB-CON -LTR-00248, the Engineer's Assistant reiterates
his request for the Contractor to submit a detailed proposal for reduction of the Temporary Traffic
Management (TTM) for Joaan and Bin Mahmoud Stations by 12 months.

The Engineer's Ass istant refers to the Quarterly Senior Management Meeting on 4 October 2015 where
Qatar Rail CEO clearly stated that 8.5 months reduction proposed for Joaan Station is not acceptable and
reiterated the 12 months TIM reduction for both stations.

Contractor response is required on or before 10 Decemqer 2015.
Yours faithfully,
