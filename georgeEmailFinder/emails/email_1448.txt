Dear Sir,

The Engineer's Assistant judges actual progress of the 1:1 Mock-up as being too slow and not in
accordance with the Revised Master Programme (M006-GDB-PRJ-SCH-00074, dated 28 January 2016).
The current planned delivery for the 1:1 concourse level mock-up is 29 February 2016, but it has come
to the Engineer's Assistant's attention that these works will not be complete untilApril 2016.

This is an instruction under Sub-Clause 8.5.1 (Rate of Progress). that the Contractor must submit, under
Sub-Clause 8.3 (Programme), a revised Programme and supporting report describing the revised
methods which the Contractor proposes to adopt in order to expedite progress and complete the Mockup Works as planned.

The revised programme and supporting report is required to be submitted within seven (7) days of
receipt of this ins uction.

Yours faithfully,
