Subject:Clause 27.1.1: Notice of Claim – Delay Notice No. 249 [post-SAA8]
Absence of CMA and Profire Quality Control Inspectors (COVID-19)
Dear Sirs,
On 2 April 2020 we received letter ref: (1) from our Electrical Subcontractor (ANEL Emirates) notifying us
that “without notice”, the CMA and Profire Quality Control (QC) Inspectors who were “supposed” to
carry out the WIR inspection scheduled that day, did not report to site due to the COVID-19 issue.
This is just one of many related issues that are continuing to delay and disrupt the progress of the
Works, and clearly is having a direct impact on the completion and testing of the Electrical Systems
installations.
The failure of CMA and Profire Inspectors to attend the site, constitutes acts of prevention and/or
breaches of Contract on the part of the Employer / Employer’s Personnel and / or Consultants, and
accordingly we give you notice, pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1, of our
right to claim:
(i)
An extension to the Time for Completion pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c); and
(ii)
An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.1 pursuant to Clause 9.10, or,
in the alternative, damages for breach of contract.
Interim and/or final details of the Time Impacts and adjustments to the Contract Price relating to this
event will be provided in due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.5(a), (b) and (c).
Finally, in order to avoid a potential reoccurrence of the above “no show” on the part of your inspectors,
can you kindly advise the inspectors’ working arrangements going forward so that we can plan
accordingly.
Yours faithfully,
