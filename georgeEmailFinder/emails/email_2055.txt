Dear Sir,

Engineer's Assistant refers to letter reference 3), wherein the Contractor was directed to submit a
quotation for any cost and time impact. The Contractor's response was due by 22 November 2016, but
to date the Contractor has not responded.

The Contractor's delay in providing the quotation is preventing the Engineer from making an informed
decision under the Sub-Clause 13.2.3.

The Con 1actor is required to provide the quotation without any further delay.
Yours faithfully,
