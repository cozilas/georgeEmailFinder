Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to letter reference 3), whereby the Engineer's Assistant requests a quotat ion
pursuant to General Condition ("GC") 13.2.1 of Volume 3 of the Contract, related to the removal of
under Platform Projectors.

The Contractor has assessed that no savings can be identified in relation to MEP and civil works relating
to the under Platform Projectors, and any savings for the non-provision of equipment should be realized
on the Architectural Provisional Sums.

The above does not take into account any additional costs to the Contractor, arising from any change to
the Employer's requirements for the concrete finishes on all platform level track walls. The Contractor
recommends to address the wall finishes under separate cover, as per letter reference 1), once the
Employer has decided on the way forward and issued a formal instruction.

Yours faithfully,
