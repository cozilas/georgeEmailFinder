Engineer’s Response to RFI/0401/17329 – Introduction of new Door No. L01-3008.01 – Request
for Engineer’s Instruction (RFEI) / Variation Order (VO)
Dear Sir
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and/or disruption to the Works and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
Your response to the RFI/0401/17329 detailed in Annex A represents a change in design and scope and
requires a valid EI and VO in order for us to integrate the same into the Works.
Potential Impact
Any requirement for additional works at this stage of the Project, such as that outlined herein, is likely to
impact on the achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within seven (7) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
On 14 April 2019, we raised RFI/0401/17038 Rev. 00 requesting further clarification and confirmation
from you regarding the relocation and deletion of a number of doors to Level L0.1, sectors 5.17 and

5.22. This included without limitation, requesting confirmation as to whether Door ‘L01-0065.04’ and its
associated access control requirements, was to be deleted or not from our scope of Works.
We requested a response to RFI/0401/17038 Rev. 00 by 22 April 2019; however, you failed to reply until
15 May 2019. Notwithstanding, you confirmed that Door ‘L01-0065.04’ was ‘deleted’ and moreover,
that the “Deleted door [does] not need SACS”. However, you then subsequently provided ‘additional
clarification’ by way of a Rev. 01 response to RFI/0401/17038 Rev. 00, issued on 28 May 2019; consisting
of a partial extract of a revised Door Schedule enumerated as ‘ASK-4068 (RFI-17038) Sheet 01 of 01’, in
confirmation that inter alia Door ‘L01-0065.04’ was listed as “Deleted”.
Following which, we raised RFI/0401/17329 Rev. 00 on 24 July 2019, having identified that despite Door
‘L01-0065.04’ having been confirmed by you as ‘deleted’, the same door number was in fact shown on
the IFC Drawings to have been assigned to another door located in the BHS shaft; and it seemed the IFC
Drawings had not been updated following the response to RFI/0401/17038 Rev. 00:
“Please note that … door L01-0065.04 is omitted under … RFI-17038 and the combined door schedule is
updated for this door [also] … which confirms [the] omission of this door as well. However we realized
that the same door number [L01-0065.04] is given for another door located on BHS shaft area on IFC (A02-458_05) under bulletin-51 which seems IFC was not updated based on those RFI responses.”
In other words, despite Door ‘L01-0065.04’ having been omitted under RFI/0401/17038 Rev. 00, the
same door tag was shown on another door also located in sector 5.12 (refer to Figure 1 below):
Figure 1 – Extract of IFC A-02-458_05
Within RFI/0401/17329 Rev.00 we elaborate on the extent of the anomaly, where we state: “… this door
tag seems removed in other bulletins without any cloud however IFC A-04-218_06 still indicated.” An
extract of IFC A-04-218_06 is provided in Figure 2 below:
Figure 2 - Extract of IFC A-04-218_06
While in another revision to the IFC, namely IFC A-02-458_11, Door ‘L01-0065.04’ was still shown to
exist, yet the other door in the BHS shaft area, the door tag number was not shown (Figure 3 below):
Figure 3 – Extract of IFC A-02-458_11
It was because of these inconsistencies and the fact the IFC Drawings had not been updated according
to your earlier RFI response, that we raised RFI/0401/17329 Rev. 00 on 24 July 2019, requesting further
clarification for the two doors shown in IFC A-02-458_11 (Figure 1): i.e. (1) Door ‘L01-0065.04’ which we
were led to believe had been omitted but for some reason was still shown in the IFC Drawings; and (2)
the other Door to the BHS Shaft area which was shown in the IFCs without / with a door tag number. In
addition to asking you to re-confirm whether the previously omitted door was required or not, we also
requested confirmation of all necessary technical information in respect of the door to the BHS shaft
area that was currently missing / not indicated on any IFC Drawings:
“…Please advise and kindly provide the related door requirements (door type, fire rating requirement,
hardware set, SACS requirement, linked to fire alarm etc. …) for this related door located at BHS Shaft. If
SACS is required please provide IFC information related to Access control, Power & Data”.
You responded to RFI/0401/17329 Rev. 00 on 8 August 2019, and referred us to a series of five (5)
attachments appended thereto i.e. ‘ASK-4099 (RFI-17329) (3 Sheets)’ and ‘YSK-0400 (2 Sheets) RFI
17329’; consisting of three marked up / clouded sketches [based on IFC Drawings]; one partial extract of
a revised Door Schedule, and one Access Control Schedule. Collectively the attachments to your
response to RFI/0401/17329 Rev. 00 confirmed that: (1) Door ‘L01-0065.04’ has been deleted in its
entirety and no longer formed part of our scope of Works; and (2), confirmed the inclusion of an entirely
new door tag number i.e. ref ‘L01-3008.01’ (refer to Figure 4 below) for the door located in the BHS
shaft area which was either incorrectly shown as being L01-0065.04’ or was not shown at all.

Figure 4 – RFI/17329 - ‘ASK-4099 (RFI-17329) Sheet 01 of 03’
On the face of it, both the revised Door Schedule and Access Control Schedule attached as part of your
response to RFI/0401/17329 Rev. 00 provided all of the technical information required i.e. Door Type,
Dimensions, Fire Rating, SACS etc., necessarily required to install Door ‘L01-3008.01’. That said, it is
clear that the introduction of door ‘L01-3008.01’ represents a change. However, given that SAA8 laid
down strict guidelines to follow if additional works are required and you appear to have ignored those
obligations, then this change will warrant a valid Engineer’s Instruction (EI) and a Variation Order (VO) if
you require us to proceed with integrating the revised scope into the Works.
We remind you of the provisions of Clause 2.29 to Clause 2.31 of SAA8 pertaining to Variations, in so far
as we are not to proceed with any Variation until a VO and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. It
is your obligation to issue this Time/Cost Record first if you wish to instigate change; but this is only after
the additional time and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.
Meanwhile, until such time as you take the action required of you in accordance with SAA8 Clause 2.29,
we are unable to proceed with implementing the changes noted herein. We trust this is clear.
Yours faithfully,
