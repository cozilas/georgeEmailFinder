Dear Sir,

The Engineer's Assistant acknowledges receipt of Contractor's letter referenced above. The Engineer's
Assistant refutes the assertion of the Contractor's letter which appears to link two discussions to arrive
at a conclusion which is incorrect and meaningless.

The discussion with Mr Bruce Pucknell represents the Engineer's Assistant's position in relation to Al
Rayyan that current AGI works should continue to a conclusion.

The mail to Mr Pinto, while referring to the discussion to proceed with ongoing works refers to
compliance with a particular Employer's Requirement. Mr Pinto correctly replies that compliance with
Employer's Requirements is necessary. The discussion has no meaning as the decision of the final
location of the station will have to be assessed on its merits and compliance with the existing Employer's
Requirements when finalised. The Contractor seems to be requesting a relaxation for an Employer's
Requirements (sub-clause 3.1.2.1 - Investigations Distance from the Works) should the final stations
position be outwith the distance stated in the relevant sub-clause. Again, the Engineer's Assistant
reiterates that this conversation has no meaning in the context of AGIworks proceeding or not.

Once t e final location of the station is known, the Employer will assess the situation and if necessary all
contra ual matters will be dealt with in line with the Conditions of Contract and Employer 's Requir
ments.

We trus that this matter is now closed.

Yours faithfully,
