Dear Sir,

We refer to Item 4 of the above Minutes of Meeting dated 14 June 2015 wherein it recorded as follows:

"RLS-JV noted that they are still awaiting the instruction from QRai/IPMC and no sketch has been
prepared, however, RLS-JV mentioned the solution would be to lower the shaft by 7m i.e. (ToR -18.019m
QND) due to unfavorable soil condition."

Since the above meeting, we have not received any indication or confirmation from you as to whether
or not the TOR level of the Blue Line profile will be lowered as mentioned above. As of now, our shaft
design was completed and approved by PMC on the basis of the agreement shown on ICF Ref. M003INT-BSB1 MTC- OST-CIV-2106. We extract the agreement for easy reference as follows:

"Agreement on alignment, coordinates and TOR between Blue Line Tunnel and Sharq Emergency Shaft
Exit.

Walkway level for information, reference towards Airport City North: TOR -10.383m QND; Walkway
level -9.443 for left track
TOR -10.303m QND; Walkway level -9.383 for right track
DC/Os confirms only the agreement on the track alignment coordinates. "

For avoidance of doubt, we will commence the construction works imminently.

Should you require to lower the tunnel profile to suit the new cross passage level which will have impact
to our construction works, please advise us and the PMC/QRail as soon as possible. Please be advised
that any change at this moment will have time and cost implications to the completion of the Gold Line
Project.
Yours faithfully,
