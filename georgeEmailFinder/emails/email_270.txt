Subject MTB- Defective AHU's
Dear Sir,
We refer to the longstanding issue regarding the defects in the Air Handling Units within the CP and
Piers as summarized below and outlined in the raised NCR's (1) to (4):
1. Moisture Carry Over issues
2. Roof Buckling/Sagging
3. Fan section wall buckling
4. Rusted Screws- JCI has provided stainless steel screws
5. Bent springs of anti-vibration mounts for fans
6. Heat Recovery Wheels (Alignment and Brushes)
7. Door Gaskets
8. Rusting of fan body and motor body
The Contractor to date has failed to take action to rectify these defective works, which poses a serious
risk to the completion of the works. This in turn has the potential to delay the partial taking over of
Piers 4 and 3 as targeted by December 2019 and January 2020 respectively. The Engineer advises that
given the continuous Contractor's non-compliance and the lack of evidenced rectification measures,
the Engineer will be left with no option but to withhold the sum of AED 6M from the next Payment
Certificate towards this non compliance. The Contractor is therefore required to take immediate
actions to bring the works into compliance with the Contract's requirements.
We hereby reserve the Employer's rights pursuant to Clause 10.3 of the Conditions of Contract for any
damages the Employer may incur as a result of the above.
Yours faithfully,
