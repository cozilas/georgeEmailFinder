Dear Sir,

Further to Engineer's letter referenced 1 above containing Engineer's Instruction No. 85, the Contractor
forwards the response of Commodore Cement Industries Doha L.L.C ("CCI") for the Engineer's Assistant's
information .

CCI have confirmed that the relaxation will have no cost benefit. However, they have advised that the
relaxation brings the Works in line with best practice standards.
We trust the above is self-explanatory.
Yours faithfully,
