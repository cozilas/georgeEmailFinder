Dear Sir,
{1) MTB/TCA/AECOM/l/ 011569 dated 24 September 2017
(2) MTC-CMA-TCA-0401-LTR-08073 dated 24August 2017
(3) RFV0-0401-1569 dated 09 July 2017
We write with reference to the above correspondence (1) in relation to RFVO (3) re lated to recovery
of overhead and profit and attendances due to the omission of Defined Provisional Sum for t he Hotel
Fit Out.
The Contractor's request for a Variation Order has been rejected and detailed reasons based upon the
Contract Clauses have been provided via correspondence (2). The Contractor's interpretation of the
"true meaning" of the Contract is rejected and the Engineer reiterates its position.
The Engineer is not required to "determine" the issue as the Contractor has not submitted a Claim
pursuant to Clause 27.1 of the Conditions of Contract.
Yours faithfully,
