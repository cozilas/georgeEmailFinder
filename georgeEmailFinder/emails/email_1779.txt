Dear Sir,

Further to the Contractor’s letter ref (2) above, wherein the Contractor submitted the Down Payment
Bond in Original for the Self-Perform execution of Architectural Finishes Works, the Contractor is hereby
submitting its amended version in Original with the reference of “Engineer’s Instruction” instead of
“Subcontract”.

Yours faithfully,
