Subject: RE: Notice of Delay- Pending Approval on Sub-Subcontractor Variations Cost

Dear Sir,
The Contractor confirms receipt of letter reference {1) wherein the Subcontractor (i) informs that, due
to
cash flow issues, the Sub-Subcontractor Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Middle East {CBEME) requires
an
on-account payment of 'not less than' AED 30 million against Variations I claims submissions and (ii)
advises that the non-payment of this amount would result in further delays to the completion of the
Subcontract Works.
To be clear, pursuant to Clause 9.18.2 of the Conditions of Subcontract, 'nothing contained in the
Subcontract or any sub-subcontract awarded by the Subcontractor shall create any contractual
relationship between the Contractor and any such Sub-subcontractor(s)'. In other words, the
Subcontractor has entered a contract with the Sub-Subcontractor CBEME; hence, it is the
Subcontractor's
responsibility to assess and/or pay the Variations/claims of his subcontractor.
Notwithstanding the contractual aspect highlighted above, be reminded that the Contractor has paid
over
AED 153 million on-account to the Subcontractor to date; over AED 55 million have been paid against
Variations, over AED 82 million have been paid against acceleration claims and AED 12 million have been
paid to improve the Subcontractor's cash flow. Furthermore, over AED 120 million out of the AED 153
million paid to the Subcontractor on-account to date, have not yet been recovered by the Contractor.
In view of the financial aid provided to the Subcontractor thus far, the Contractor is perplexed at the
Subcontractor's demands and requests the Subcontractor provides reasonable evidence that these
onaccounts
payments have been passed on to the Sub-Subcontractor(s). Pursuant to Clause 21.3.3 of the
Conditions of Subcontract, the Subcontractor is requested to provide such evidence within three {3)
days
of this notice.
Yours faithfully,
