Subject:Re: Lack of Open Areas / Work-Fronts for Stone Installation
Dear Sir,
In response to your referenced letters (2) to (4) and other letters with similar content sent by you
previously, wherein you have been alleging that you have no sufficient work front, we respond as
follows.
We refute your allegations in its entirety and clarify for the record that you currently have more than
14,000 m2 available work front for stone installation works in CP Level 2 and 3. Please refer to the
attached drawings for CP Level 2.0 and 3.0 which indicate the available work fronts for stone
installation. For ease of reference find below a table indicating the CP works to date, as mentioned
above:
We once again reiterate, as stated in our letter reference (1), that we remain increasingly concerned
regarding your delays and lack of progress at site, which has not improved despite our recurrent
instructions to proceed with the works without any delay. Furthermore, the delays are due to your lack
of manpower and lack of materials on site which you had previously been instructed to increase and
take remedial measures but failed to do so. Please note that your failure to use the required resources
as instructed, constitutes a breach of Contract. Consequently, your attention is drawn to Subcontract
Clause 8 [Subcontractor's Obligations] which sets out your obligations as:
"8.1.2 The Subcontractor shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that it completes the Subcontract
Works, and each and every part of the Subcontract Works, in such manner and in such time so as to
allow the Contractor to comply with any obligations under the Contract … The Subcontractor shall
neither delay nor adversely affect the performance of the Contractor or other subcontractors. The
Subcontractor, without additional compensation, shall vary the sequence of its Works as the Contractor

may reasonably instruct... The Subcontractor shall promptly increase its work force or other resources
accelerate its performance, work overtime, Fridays and holidays, all without additional compensation, as
necessary to maintain progress of the Subcontract Works. ",
On the basis of the above, you are hereby informed that there is sufficient stone installation work-front
which is adequate for the next few weeks ahead. Therefore, as previously stated within a plethora of
correspondences, you will be held completely culpable for any associated delays in regards to the
matter discussed herein.
Accordingly, you are instructed to provide an action Plan to mitigate the delays strictly in accordance
with Clause 16.4.1 [Recovery of Delays] and coordinate your works in a proper sequence by means of
continuous communication with our construction team, to avoid any similar future events.
In light of the above, it is noted that your effort aiming to generate alleged claims by presenting
incorrect information, will hold no ground and will only drag the issues longer. As such, you are
requested to refrain from generating unnecessary correspondence and proceed on site without any
further delay to complete the works.
Accordingly, any delays, costs, losses and/or expenses and the like incurred by us and/or Other SubContractors arising as a result of the aforementioned issue, will be solely your responsibility including
but not limited to Clauses 10.3 [Contractor’s Claims] and 12.12 [Other Contractors and Other
Subcontractors].
Yours faithfully,
