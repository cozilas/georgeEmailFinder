Re: Room Completion Status- August 2018

Dear Sir,
We are in receipt of your letter referenced (1) above, informing us about the room completion status
and requesting us to review the related activities and provide a recovery plan.
Please be informed that the rooms completed are shared on a weekly basis via email correspondence to
the Engineer. The latest plan has been included in the same excel file shared via the enclosed email sent
on 15th November 2018. According to the mentioned plan and room completion status, on the cut-off
dates of 26th October 2018 and 2nd November 2018, a number of 602 and 713 rooms have been
completed versus 598 and 710 which were planned to be completed. Consequently, the room
completion is 4 and 3 rooms respectively, ahead of the plan.
Kindly note that weekly progress reports will continue to be shared with the Engineer to ensure that you
are adequately informed.
We trust you find the aforementioned self-explanatory and clarifies the matter. Should the need arise
for any further clarification on the matter, kindly do not hesitate to contact us.
Yours faithfully,
