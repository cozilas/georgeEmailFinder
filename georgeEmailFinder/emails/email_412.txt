Subject:Delay Notification – GH20 SCR MEP Works
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to your letter (1) in which you advise us of constant slippage to the completion
of MEP works inside Gate House GH20 SCR.
You are more than aware that the delay to the completion of the MTA works in the location of GH20 has
seriously impacted our planned work. The MTA Contractor’s works were not completed until early May
2019, causing unplanned delays which were outside of our control and contemplation.
We have sent many e-mails to you on the matter in February and March 2019, notifying you that our
work fronts need to be cleared from the constraints related to MTA Contractor’s uncompleted works. In
particular, the pending MTA works has significantly hindered the installation of the raised floor within
the SCR to Gatehouse GH20 which is critical for ADDC inspections and Form 4 approvals.
Several e-mails exchanged between us including site photos for GH20 electrical closet where the 400 Hz
cables are missing and MTA cables are pulled back and looped in the room due to external apron works
and the demolished duct bank, which is due to the MTA Contractor delaying our works. Copies of some
of the e-mails exchanged between 7 and 10 March 2019 are attached for reference.
Accordingly, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses
16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to the Time
for Completion and any associated costs due to the acts of prevention described herein.
Meanwhile, we reiterate that we remain fully committed to ADAC, the Project and to completing our
obligations within the shortest possible time, without compromising on safety and quality, but will not
be held responsible for such factors as those outlined above for which we are not culpable.
Yours faithfully,
