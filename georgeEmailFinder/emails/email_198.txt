Subject:Engineer’s Delays – SCRs’ Energization in CP and Pier 2
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to your letter (1) in which you state that we failed to achieve Milestone MS9C
by 31 October 2019, making reference to the delays to the SCRs’ energization activities in the CP and
Pier 2 locations.
With our letter (3), we have already responded to your letter (2) in full on the subject. Therefore, we see
no merit in unnecessarily repeating what we have already confirmed to you in writing previously.
Our position is clear, and we refer you to the delays we have suffered resulting from late approval of our
Form 4 submissions, which is outside of control, together with the MTA Contractor’s (L&T) late
completion in those locations.
We conclude by reiterating that we remain fully committed to ADAC, the Project and to completing our
obligations within the shortest possible time, without compromising on safety and quality, but will not
be held responsible for such factors as those outlined above for which we are not culpable.
Yours faithfully,
