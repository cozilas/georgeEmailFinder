Dear AB JV,
Further to our email below, this is to put on record that we have not received yet, the overdue
payments amounting to AED 1,943,334.79, which are long overdue, as discussed below.
We reiterate once more, that we have been financing the project for a few months, but we are unable
to continue to do so without receipt of our payments.
As a result, we will gradually start pulling-out workers and staff from the site to avoid having further
financial risks as a consequence of your actions. We will continue pulling-out workers from the site, until
receipt of the full overdue payment of AED 1,943,334.79.
We note that this has been affecting and will continue to negatively affect the progress of the works.
Please be informed, that all negative consequences (i.e. legal, financial, administrative, etc.) arising due
to your failure to proceed with our payment on time, shall be your responsibility.
In addition, AB JV shall be held fully responsible for any delays that may occur as a result of the above.
This is for your immediate action.
Yours faithfully,
