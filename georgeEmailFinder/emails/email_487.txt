Dear Sir,

Re: Obstruction to the Employer's Other Contractor at Family Hub Arcade Area

We are in receipt of your letter referenced (1) above, regarding the alleged delays caused by us to the
Employer’s other Contractor (M/s Cloisall) at the Family Hub Arcade area.
After reviewing the content of your letter, we note that the information provided is not clear and
requires further substantiation to enable us evaluating the alleged delays appropriately. Specifically, the
aforementioned letter contains 3 nos. of poor quality photos, showing two workers supposedly causing
obstruction to the Employer’s other Contractor. The photos are not clear and do not indicate which of
the MEP Subcontractors (i.e. Anel, PCE, Alemco, TCAJV etc.) is actually working in the area. Additionally,
the workers and the obstruction they are allegedly causing by standing in what appears to be a large
open area, cannot be identified.
In view of the event discussed herein and any future similar events you may wish to inform us, we kindly
request you to specifically identify the responsible party and/or the root cause by submitting adequate
evidence. In case any of the Employer’s other Contractor wishes to pursue a claim against TCAJV and/or
any of TCAJV’s Subcontractors, the onus is on you and the Employer’s other Contractor to provide
correct particulars in the form of substantiation/evidence of the incident for our action and to inform
the parties involved accordingly.
We trust you find the aforementioned self-explanatory and clarifies the matter.
Yours faithfully,
