ANNEX A
DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT
Introduction
On 28 November 2018 we submitted Material Submittal No: MS/0401/L/0023 Rev. 04 in relation to the
Irrigation Motor Control Panel manufactured by ABB (refer to Table 1 below) as per Specification Section
328000 (‘Irrigation’). Attached thereto was inter alia a Technical Compliance Sheet, Comments and
Reply Sheet, and Material Submittal Approval Letter addressing each of the comments raised in

response to the Rev. 03 submittal. We also stated “This material is already approved via MAR ref:
MS/0401/M/0151”.

As noted, MS/0401/L/0023 Rev. 04 was returned on 12 May 2018 classified as approved Status Code 2.
According to an attached e-mail dated 12 December 2018 [12:00 PM], it was agreed that:
TCAJV/Citiscape would like to request a relaxation/Waiver to submit the sample for MS/0401/L/0023
Rev04 and note that the following will be provided:
1.
Once the referenced subject has been technically approved (Code 2) by the Client/ Consultant/
Engineer representatives, TCAJV /Citiscape / ABB will proceed with the manufacturing of a sample of
each type of motor control panel, in accordance with schedule requirements and addressing ALL the
previous comments on the sample from previous revision. Sample/s will be kept at the factory premises
for inspection of the same and will not be shipped to site prior to the approval of the former
representatives.
2.
TCAJV/Citiscape will arrange a factory inspection visit and to issue an invite to the Client/
Consultant/ Engineer in due time.
3.
Technical comments raised by the Client/ Consultant/ Engineer representatives during the
inspection visit, in compliance with the specification and regulatory requirements, will be implemented
by TCAJV /Citiscape / ABB, as per contract.
4.
Once TCAJV /Citiscape / ABB are done with the implementation of the technical comments
raised in the factory, TCAJV /Citiscape shall arrange another inspection factory visit for re-inspection of
the panels by Client/ Consultant / Engineer representatives for review and approval.
Awaiting your approval to assist us to progress accordingly.’
However, as we were under pressure from all parties to deliver the panels urgently, accordingly the
panels were delivered immediately after fabrication, and inspected and installed subject to Material
Inspection Requests (MIR) MIR-CI-MEP-00032 Rev. 00 (Pier 3 L0.1 and CP L.01) on 30 October 2019 and
MIR-CI-MEP-00040 Rev 00 (Pump Rooms Piers 2 L.01 and External L0.0), on 9 February 2020.
Notably, both MIRs were annotated with the similar comments as per the following:
‘Inspection is done as per approved Material Submittal MS/0401/L/0023-04 and found acceptable’
‘Contractor shall incorporate all comments given by the Consultant in the Material Submittals etc ...’
Following which, we submitted Material Submittal No: MS/0401/L/0023 Rev. 05 on 1 March 2020 in the
manner shown in Table 2 having addressed the comments issued in response to the Rev. 04 submittal.

We note that both the Rev. 04 and Rev. 05 submittal responses were returned by you beyond the turnaround times stipulated in the Contract. Specifically, Article 1.3 of Specification Section 013300
‘Submittal Procedures’ governs the processing time by which you are contractually obligated to reply to
our submittals. For example, MS/0401/L/0023 Rev. 05 ought to have been responded to within 7
calendar days from the date of submission. However, Table 1 shows that you exceeded this review
period by 9 calendar days.
Notwithstanding the overdue response, we further note that Material Submittal No: MS/0401/L/0023
Rev. 05 had been returned classified Status Code 3 ‘Revise & Resubmit’, together with the following

comments; an extract of the responded submittal and accompanying comments are illustrated in Figure
1 below:
Figure 1
In which respect, we make the following comments and observations:
•
As noted in the e-mail dated 12 December 2018 attached to the response MS/0401/L/0023 Rev.
04, we did offer you an opportunity to re-check and re-inspect the delivered material again on Site and
stressed that we were “Awaiting your approval” and confirmation of the same, but we failed to receive
any positive response until we received the official rejection of MS/0401/L/0023 Rev. 05.
•
We resubmitted the approved MS/0401/L/0023 Rev.04 (Code 2) to clarify the correct BMS
interface points (only) as mentioned in the IFC so; BMS Points for each panel has been clarified to match
the Project requirements. Kindly refer to the Comment Reply Sheet attached to the Rev.05 Submittal
•
We believe the Material Submittal for Irrigation Motor Control Panels MS/0401/L/0023 Rev. 05
(Code 3) rejected with unfair comments which are related to Sample only (Specification Division 01
sample requirement is a general definition and is not specific for each item).
The above issues were conveyed to you in our e-mail to you dated 23 March 2020 [10:09 AM], ref: (2).
Following which, the Irrigation Motor Control Panel was re-inspected jointly by TCAJV/CMA/ADAC on 30
March 2020 and no technical comments were provided. However, in your e-mail issued on the same
date, i.e. 30 March 2020 [09:49 AM] ref: (3) you requested us to resubmit the submittal. On the basis
we maintain that your Status Code 3 response to MS/0401/L/0023 Rev. 05 is unreasonable, we
requested that you recode the material submittal, but you refused. It is for this reason that we issue
this E-Notice No. 243. We further advised that “The comments responses addressed the control
requirement of BMS specification 230900 and irrigation specification 328000 for which we did not
receive technical feedback from CMA.”
To conclude therefore, and in view of the foregoing, we are surprised at receiving such an unreasonable
Status Code 3 rejected response to MS/0401/L/0023 Rev. 05 especially at this stage of the Project.
Again, we urge you to consider re-coding the Submittal as Status Code 2 or higher in lieu of the current
Code 3.
Meanwhile, we put on record that your unreasonable comments issued in response to MS/0401/L/0023
Rev. 05, particularly at this stage of the Project will invariably delay completion of irrigation and
landscaping works and impact on associated inspections, thus invariably delaying the Time for
Completion. Accordingly, any delays incurred to date or which may be incurred by us as a result of the
above shall be at your risk.
Yours faithfully,
