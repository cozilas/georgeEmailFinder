Dear Sir,
From the meeting held 31 May 2015 at Room 1 Qatar Rail Building A l Waab Site Office and attended by
both Qatar Rail Gold Line Project Director and Contractor's Project Director, further review and
consideration has been given to Contractor's Option VE 3 Stages 1 and 2 for the implementation of Ras
Bu Abboud Stabling Facility.

Attached is Contractor's Drawing of VE 3 Phases 1 and 2 Stabling Operations which has now been
"Approved in Principle" by Qatar Rail.

Contractor is referred to Sub-Clause 13.5, where Contractor is required to submit a written value
engineered proposal for review and consideration by the Engineer's Assistant. Contractor is to provide
demonstrated evidence of any potential benefits to the Project and detailed analysis of known savings.
The proposal is to be submitted by no later than fourteen (14) days from receipt of this letter.

In addition Contractor is further required to provide, as soon as practicable, but no later than fourteen
(14) days from the receipt of this letter, a detailed programme that is to include both design and
construction activities and provides clear demonstration of how the Contractor intends to deliver the
KITO date STKID.1 associated with Ras Bu Abboud.

The Contractor is also requested to confirm that he has recommenced construction related activities
without any further delay in order to mitigate against further impact on the Contractor's programme.

The En ineer's Assistant looks forward to Contractor's positive focus and action on the above,

Yours faithfully,
