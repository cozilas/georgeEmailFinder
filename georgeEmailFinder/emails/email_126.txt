Subject:
Pipe Brackets for Support of Storm & Sewage Network at Airside, Pier 3 Head.
Dear Sir,
We refer to receipt of Bulletin 268 issued under letter ref: (1) and the ongoing discussions between
ourselves and CMA/ADAC/NACO in relation to the storm and sewer pipe network supports at the Airside
Pier 3 head, and herewith attach a structural design report that proves safe usage of the pipe brackets
considering worst case loading scenarios as well the as built conditions of the noted area.

Kindly note that an advance copy of this report was issued to you on 15 March 2018. Nevertheless, we
herewith submit this report formally as requested to do so by you. Note also that this report is issued
for CMA/ADAC/NACO review and confirmation. We remind you that we are not the designers for the
Project, and accept no liability for the design. Therefore, the Employerâ€™s Design Consultant will need to
satisfy itself as to the calculations set out in the attached report. Following which, we look forward to
receipt of your formal instruction for us to proceed with the requisite installations.
This is for your kind information, record and necessary actions.
Yours faithfully,
