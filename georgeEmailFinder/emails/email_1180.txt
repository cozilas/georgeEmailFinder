Dear Sir,
As advised to the Subcontractor in previous occasions, the Contractor is currently consulting with the
Employer in an endeavour to reach agreement on the valuation of Variations associated with the
Subcontractor's package. In order to enable this process of consultation to conclude in a satisfactory
manner for all parties, the Contractor requires the Subcontractor's cooperation in respect of the
submission of outstanding Requests for Variation Orders (RFVOs) with full supporting particulars.
Moreover, the Subcontractor is required to expedite the preparation of all RFVOs which have not yet
been submitted to date. Failure to provide the necessary information will prejudice both the
Subcontractor's entitlement and the Contractor's ability to evaluate these Variations to the satisfaction
of all parties.
In respect of outstanding particulars, the Contractor reiterates its request that the Subcontractor
submits the connection quantities (as per both Contract and latest bulletin drawings) and accordingly
updates the take-off sheet provided by the Contractor via the minutes of meeting held on 10 December
2017. Further, the Subcontractor is again requested to provide the Contractor with the 'Gatehouses out
of Tolerance Report' which has been referred to by the Subcontractor's management in previous
instances and may enable the parties to reach agreement on this matter.
The Subcontractor is requested to submit the abovementioned information within fou rteen (14) days of
this notice. The Contractor is committed to working with the Subcontractor to satisfactory resolve its
Variation account; however, should the Subcontractor fail to provide the necessary supporting
information as required by both the Subcontract and international Best Practice for projects of this scale
and complexity within the requested timeframes, the Contractor will proceed with its fair and
reasonable determination in due course.
Yours faithfully,
