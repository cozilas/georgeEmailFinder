Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer's Instruction Nr.82 of reference 4) issued pursuant to General Condition ("GC")
13.1.1 of Volume 3 of the Contract, the Contractor encloses herewith full particulars of its actual design
costs related to the varied requirement with respect to the Autowalks (Moving Walkways).

The relevant Fee Change Notice (FCN) 071 includes payment requests from Atkins on account of other
design changes as well which are not related to the Engineer's Instruction Nr. 82 and hence no reference
has been made herein. Those shall be addressed by the Contractor under a separate cover in due
course.

As a direct consequence of this instruction to vary the works, the Contractor instructed Atkins to
perform additional work and has received a notice for additional payment by Atkins on account of the
additional design works entailed. Those can be summarized as per the following table:

Table 1) FCN 071 (Travellators): Amounts claimed by Atkins, AL YSJ JV Determination for the same and
payments to date
As detailed herein, the Contractor estimates that OAR 1,319,471.98 is a fair and reasonable
compensation to Atkins against the originally claimed value of OAR 2,961,955.12 which was, at the
Contractor's opinion, overstated both in terms of the applicable staff rates and the respective time
spent.

The Contractor has enclosed as attachment 1) to this letter its determination of FCN 071.

Whilst noting that none of its aforementioned determination amounts have been agreed with Atkins as
full and sole compensation with the entire balance being the subject of an ongoing dispute, the
Contractor has nevertheless paid the amount of OAR 1,319,471.98 already, for which proof of payment
in the form of electronic payment (wire transfer) documents has been enclosed as attachment 2).

In any event, and whilst noting that the FCN 071 determination amount may be subject to further
change, the Contractor kindly requests the Employer to proceed with an interim, on-account payment of
its current determination value plus 12% for profits and overheads, in the net amount of QAR
1,477,809.00.

Such payment would be of invaluable assistance to the continued financing of the Project. Yours
faithfully,
Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer's Instruction of reference 4) issued pursuant to General Condition ("GC") 13.1.1
of Volume 3 of the Contract, the Contractor encloses herewith full particulars in relation to the varied
scope, quantities and direct costs in accordance with its GC 13.2.2 obligations.

The Contractor's detailed valuation of this variation is enclosed as attachment 1 to this letter and further
summarized in table 1) below. Further supporting particulars in relationto the Contractor's pricing
methodology can be found in attachments 2, 3 and 4 .

The main repercuss ion of changing Volume 6, Section 13, Items 13.3.3.12.a.(iii) and 13.3.3.12.e.(i) via
letter reference 4) is an overall increase to the travellators ' length which has modified the respective
subways' base slab profiles resulting to additional concrete and earthwork quantities.

The evaluation of additional costs associated with the enlarged travellators and ancillary equipment is
currently ongoing and shall be made available to the Engineer's Assistant for review immediately upon
receipt of the same by Mis Kone.

The interim adjustment of the Contract Price is therefore of the net amount of QR 3,588,227 .37. The
Contractor reserves its rights to recover any time related costs in connect ion to this Variation which
shall be addressed under a separate cover.

Yours faithfully,
