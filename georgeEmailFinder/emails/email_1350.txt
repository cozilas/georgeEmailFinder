Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to the Engineer's Assistant's ("EA") letter at reference 1 (received on 21 July 2015)
in which the EA refers to the Contractor's June 2015 ELS Claim Update (issued via reference 3) and, in
addition to its letter at reference 4, gives notice again of its request, pursuant to General Condition
("GC") 20.1.8, for further particulars and responds on the general principles of the Claim.

In response to the EA's letter at reference 1, the Contractor refers to its letter at reference 2 which was
recently sent in response to the EA's letter at reference 4.

Yours faithfully,
