Dear Sir,

The Contractor is in receipt of the Engineer’s direction of letter reference 1) to submit a quotation under
Sub-Clause 13.2.1 of Volume 3 of the Contract and notes the following:

Tables 1, 2 and 3 attached to letter reference 1) relate to an early version of the respective ICF which
was further developed during the interface coordination process with the Systems Contractor prior to
being formalized as per reference 3).

Tables 1, 2 and 3 of letter reference 1) are therefore deficient in their current form by reason of not
presenting an accurate demarcation of the Contractor’s Scope of Works. The sole appropriate baseline
for the purpose of compiling such a quotation is the ICD of reference 3).

Another prerequisite for the Contractor to provide a quotation for any of the items currently under the
Systems Contractor’s Scope is a sufficiently developed design. To date the Contractor was not received
any such design, neither from the Employer nor from the Systems Contractor.

The Contractor therefore kindly requests the Engineer to revise the direction of reference 1)
accordingly. To support the Engineer in this task, the Contractor has classified each item within ICD
reference 3) according to the following categories:

0 – Systems Contractor experience and equipment required – The Contractor cannot provide a
quotation
1 – The Contractor can provide a quotation for the Equipment, Material, Installation and T&C after being
provided relevant specifications and detailed designs by the Employer
2 – A price has been provided by the Contractor in the context of the ongoing ‘Settlement Agreement’
3 – Items already included in the Contractor’s Scope of Works – input and design by MSI remains
necessary as per ICD reference 3)
4 – Items to be instructed under Provisional Sums

The Contractor has enclosed the ICD of reference 3) incorporating the above categorization for each
item as attachment 1) to this letter. Finally, the Contractor notes that the information requested by the
Engineer in relation to ‘Table 3’ attached to letter reference 1) is contained within Contractor’s letter
reference 2).

Yours faithfully,
