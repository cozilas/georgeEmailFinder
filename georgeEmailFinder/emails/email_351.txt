ANNEX A
Description of the Event
Background
Between 25 July 2018 and 4 November 2018, we raised a series of five (5) RFIs in the manner shown in
Table 1 below, attached to which was a ‘final study’ [by way of individual spreadsheets] recording the
cover levels for each of the noted utilities, requesting your assistance with checking the schedule against
the notes detailed in the body of each RFI, and asking for confirmation of the same.

In broad terms, each of the attached ‘studies’ records the total number of pits or manholes that are
then sub-divided between various categories, recording whether the pits or manholes are located in:
•
Landscaped areas;
•
Asphalt areas;
•
Road Pavement areas; or
•
Walking Pavement areas.
Very simply, the main body of each RFI summarises the various utilities according to each category and
identifies whether there is a discrepancy between the landscaping contour and the approved pit or
manhole levels and requests your approval to our various suggestions to overcome this; or where the
two match, then we requested your approval so that we could proceed to cast the pit top slabs.
In the event, despite requesting your response by the ‘reply required by’ dates shown in Table 1, you
failed to reply to each of the noted RFIs by periods of between 16 and 68 calendar days later.
A brief summation of the responses to each RFI follows:
RFI/0401/16325
Attached was an amended schedule of the sewer manhole indicating revisions to the cover levels where
the Design Consultant’s (KPF) response records we had provided a CAD file on 13 August 2018 that was
used as the basis to calculate the levels. This also records that the levels in the landscaped areas are for
the Employer to decide; albeit the Landscape Consultant’s reply was shown as ‘N/A’.
RFI/0401/16355 (ref: 1)

Attached was an amended schedule of the IT pits indicating revisions to the cover levels where the
Design Consultant’s (KPF) response records we had provided a CAD file on 13 August 2018 that was used
as the basis to calculate the levels. Also attached was a sketch drawing showing the related areas
affected by change. On this occasion the Landscape Consultant responded and confirmed that two
workshops had been held on 20 and 24 September 2018 and the attached schedule and sketch reflects
the Landscape Consultant’s response to those workshops. This also records e-mail exchanges between
us [the Contractor] and the Employer [ADAC] at end of September / early October 2018 that there is no
additional time or costs associated with us accommodating the revised contour levels.
The response also records that the potable water manhole cover levels were to be determined once it
received a potable water manhole spreadsheet from us that warrants a further RFI to be raised.
RFI/0401/16457 (ref: 2)
Attached was an amended schedule of the sewer manhole indicating revisions to the cover levels albeit
on this occasion the Design Consultant’s (KPF) simply records that the levels in the landscaped areas are
for the Employer to decide; albeit the Landscape Consultant’s reply was shown as ‘N/A’.
RFI/0401/16457 (ref: 3)
Attached was an amended schedule of the sewer manhole indicating revisions to the cover levels albeit
on this occasion the Design Consultant’s (KPF) simply records that the levels in the landscaped areas are
for the Employer to decide; albeit the Landscape Consultant’s reply was shown as ‘N/A’.
RFI/0401/16458 (ref: 4)
Attached was a revised schedule of potable water manholes indicating revisions to the cover levels
together with a sketch drawing showing the related areas affected by change. On this occasion the
Landscape Consultant responded by stating that the potable water manholes were agreed during a
workshop held on 19 November 2018 and that all levels except for MH4 had been agreed; it also
recommended reducing levels to avoid the need for a retaining wall in the area between manholes.
Recent Events
However, on 3 March 2019, we received an e-mail from you [timed at 5:10 PM] which in addition to
recording the above events, also advised us that following a further review of the contour levels and
water feature utilities, further changes to the landscaping levels were to be made. Amongst other
things, you asked us to agree to changes in levels in exchange for the removal of the crib [retaining]
walls at no extension of time or cost. You also requested confirmation as to when the works to Zone 1
(North) and Zone 4 (South) could be handed over to Landscaping and Other Contractors. You further
advised that the revised details/levels would be issued to us via further RFI response(s).
We replied on 4 March 2019 [08:35 AM], advising you that “we will complete this … additional work at
no cost” [emphasis added] on the understanding that the crib walls would be deleted from our scope.
We further advised that we would come back to you on when the work could be completed.
Following which on 25 March 2019, we received revised responses to four out of five of the RFIs listed in
Table 1; annotated as ‘RFI/0401/16355-01’, ‘RFI/0401/16457-01’, ‘RFI/0401/16458-01’, and
RFI/0401/16556-01’, attached to which were four sketches indicating the revised contour levels [albeit
they record that an advance copy of the sketches had been issued to us by e-mail on 3 March 2019].
Additionally, however, the Landscape Consultant’s response also informs us that “The contour lines
have been further refined to take account of the following additional information:
1.
Fire Hydrant Locations,
2.
North Embankment Airside Fence Layout
3.
VVIP water feature revised piping layout.”
The revised responses to each of these four RFIs also records that ‘Revision 4 of the [North and South
Contour] drawings’ was issued to us on 19 March 2019 which shows ‘on the final contour levels’.
We note that 25 March 2019 is some three to five months after the initial RFI responses were issued.

Nevertheless, receipt of the revised contour drawings on 19 March 2019 triggered a further series of
discussions between us, which inter alia, subsequently caused us to raise a further three RFIs (refer to
Table 2 below), that collectively sought to record the outcome of those meetings and by the same token
requested your confirmation of the revised potable, IT, storm and sewer manhole levels.

As noted these additional RFIs were raised in order to elicit some form of formal confirmation from you
as to the following that were discussed and agreed after numerous meetings and, workshops;
particularly given the fact that the revised drawings were issued to us by hand and not formally:
•
Levels for Storm and Sewer networks at the Landside;
•
Revised contour levels;
•
Cover levels for Potable, Power and IT network at the Landside, L0.0.
Once again despite requesting your response by the ‘reply required by’ dates shown in Table 2, you
failed to reply to each of the noted RFIs by periods of between 6 and 26 calendar days later.
A brief summation of the responses to each RFI follows:
RFI/0401/17221 (ref: 5)
The Landscape Consultant confirmed three additional workshops held on 30 May 2019, and 16 and 25
June 2019, and similarly confirmed that we were to proceed with the revised levels agreed within
RFI/0401/17221. The Design Consultant’s response also records that ‘As previously agreed between
Client, Engineer and Contractor, the works must be carried out at no additional cost.’
RFI/0401/17244 (ref: 6)
The Landscape Consultant confirmed that Rev. 4 of the drawings had been issued to us on 19 March
2019 but also records that ‘As previously agreed between Client, Engineer and Contractor, the works
must be carried out at no additional cost.’
RFI/0401/17296 (ref: 7)
The Landscape Consultant confirmed that levels for potable water, power and it manholes are as per
correspondence attached to the RFI [e-mails dated 10 June 2019 to 4 July 2019] but was to ensure that
it was to submit the relevant coordinated and updated shop drawings for Consultant’s review.
Summary
In view of the foregoing, we put on record that the impact of the further changes to the contour levels
that were initially promulgated by you on 19 June 2019 and then subsequently agreed during successive
meetings and discussions throughout June/July 2019, and then subsequently confirmed by you in the
response to the RFIs referenced in Table 2 above, have affected and are continuing to affect and delay
our works. Specifically, numerous concrete manholes require to be reinstated along with required
additional backfilling works. Further details regarding these works are provided below:
Impact on concrete manholes – the revised manhole cover levels are causing numerous already
constructed manholes to be reinstated. This will necessitate breaking numerous already constructed
manholes and reinstating them to the required levels, respectively. This will involve reinstatement of
the manholes and inter alia include works such as concrete breaking, formwork placement, additional
reinforcement, re-pouring of concrete, lifting covers, all of which require additional time and cost.

Impact on the backfilling works - additional quantities of backfill materials will be required to achieve
the revised levels required by you. Once again, this will take time and result in additional cost.
Therefore, we record that the revised contour levels will require additional works and will impact the
concrete manholes and also require additional backfilling works as stated above. The additional cost
[and time] for such works, cannot be construed as having been “previously agreed between Client,
Engineer and Contractor” on the basis a further set of revised levels were issued on 25 March 2019.
Under the circumstances, given that these works are additional to our scope, will necessitate that you
re-issue IFC Drawings under an Engineer’s Instruction / Variation Order, if you require the additional
work to be undertaken by us. Moreover, for the reasons stated above, we refute the content of your
subsequent letter (ref: 8), wherein you have notified us regarding an alleged lack of progress of the
external works and a purported failure to provide access to the landscaping areas to the Employer’s
Other Contractor (Landscape Contractor) – allegedly due in June 2019. Any verbal agreement that we
may have made in early March 2019 to complete the contour levelling etc. by 13 June 2019 has been
negated by the fact that revised levels were issued to us on 25 June 2019. Furthermore, the extent of
the additional works outlined above consequent on the revised contour levels have caused serious
delays and are directly affecting the completion of external works and the landscaping areas.
Furthermore, at the risk of being repetitive, our ability to commence the additional works i.e.
reinstatement of manholes and additional backfilling works is dependent upon an EI and a VO.
Accordingly, we take this opportunity in reminding you of the provisions of Clauses 2.29 to 2.31 of
Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’) pertaining to Variations, in so far as we are not to
proceed with any Variation unless a Variation Order and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. In
which respect, it is your obligation to issue this Record first if you wish to instigate change; this is only
after the additional time and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.
Meanwhile, until such time as you take the action required of you in accordance with SAA8 Clause 2.29,
we are unable to proceed with implementing any of the changes outlined and described above.
Yours faithfully,
