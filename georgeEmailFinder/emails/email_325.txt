Subject:Delay Notification – Bulletin 218.1 Works
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to your letters (1) and (2) in which you advise us of delays by us pertaining to
the late procurement of materials, affecting the line array speaker delivery.
We remind you that the line array speakers were part of a Variation to our Contract, instructed by you
under cover of Bulletin 218.1. At the time of issuing the bulletin, the manufacturer had ceased
production of the specified product. It was therefore unavailable in the local and international market.
However, after protracted dialogue with the manufacturer, our Subcontractor convinced the
manufacturer to produce the 13 no line array speakers as a special ‘one-off’ for the MTB project.
Consequently, delivery took much longer than anticipated, for the specified product.
While we remain fully committed to ADAC, the Project and to completing our obligations within the
shortest possible time, it is unfortunate you felt it necessary to issue us with a delay notice on this
occasion when we did our utmost to accommodate you / ADAC in the manner described above.
Under the circumstances we refute your wrongful allegations that the procurement delays are
attributable to any perceived lack of coordination on our part and / or a shortage of resources.
Yours faithfully,
