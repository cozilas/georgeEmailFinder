Subject: RE: Out of Tolerance Steel to Grid line- E53 North lnfill
Dear Sir,
The Contractor confirms receipt of letter reference (1) wherein the Subcontractor shares its view that
'the

steel has not deflected as anticipated' and, whilst providing a simple recollection of pictures, claims that
the skylight frame cannot be fitted in line with the adjacent frames.
Firstly, the Contractor feels prudent to remind the Subcontractor that it is an integral part of its scope to
'make due allowance for previous trades tolerances which may effect the Subcontract Works'.
Moreover,
the roof cladding Specification 074101, Clause 4.7 [Movement and Deflection] and Clause 13.2
[Tolerances] clearly state that the roofing works shall allow for the building tolerances, deflections,
changes in dimension etc. The Contractor notes that the Subcontractor has not explained why the actual
deflection of the steel structure could not have been reasonably foreseen on the Effective Date and
therefore would be over and above the aforementioned contractual obligations.
In addition to the above, it is noted that the Subcontractor's letter (1) does not provide the minimum
level
of detail (such as a report with as-built surveys) that enable the Contractor to assess this further. Should
the Subcontractor be of the opinion that the actual movement of the steel structure is beyond any
permissible deviation; the Subcontractor may submit full detailed particulars to the Contractor
demonstrating its entitlement. Meanwhile, the Subcontractor is requested to advise its proposals to
achieve the project requirements for appearance and fit as specified in the Contract Documents.
Yours faithfully,
