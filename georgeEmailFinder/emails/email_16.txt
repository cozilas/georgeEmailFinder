Subject:

Delays and Idle-Time Incurred Due to Cranes Unavailability

Dear Sir,
With reference to the above subject, this is to notify you of the delaying events encountered during the
execution of our works attributed to ABJV which have affected our ability to act in accordance with our
responsibilities in respect of the planned progress of the works.
Specifically, on 10 November 2020, we informed you via our emails, including but not limited to our
email dated 10 Nov 2020 [5:07 PM], attached to Annex A hereto, about the unavailability of Tower
Cranes TC-4 and TC-8, which were being used to other parts of the works.
As a consequence of this, we incurred idle/non-productive hours beyond our control since we were
unable to progress with our works. Moreover, this event(s) has hindered us from properly planning,
programming, and managing the works in a productive manner. We put on record, that the nonavailability of the mentioned cranes continued from 10 November 2020 to 14 November 2020, as
evidenced by our records, attached to Annex B hereto.
Attached to Annex B hereto, are the ‘Daily Site Record of Resources’ which demonstrate the exact
number of our manpower which remained idle during the mentioned dates due to the non-availability
of the cranes. We also note that a hardcopy of these records has been handed over to you for
acknowledgment and signature, however, we are yet to receive the signed copy of the said records.
It is for this reason, we have informed you via our email date 16 Nov 2020 [3:14 PM], that the
abovementioned events which are beyond our control, have caused 1041 idle-hours. In our said email,
we stressed the fact that albeit we have been doing our utmost to mitigate the delays, these events are
highly likely to delay and prevent us from completing our works at the specified time of completion.
Find more information about the Idle hours discussed in the email dated Nov 28, 2020, at 9:21 AM and
the site records.
Additional idle hours incurred on 5 December 2020, which were notified to you via our email dated 5
Dec 2020 [8:10 AM], attached to Annex A hereto. The ‘Daily Site Record of Resources’ which

demonstrate the exact number of our idle manpower, attached to Annex B hereto, were forwarded to
you via our email dated 6 Dec 2020 [8:42 AM] and 6 Dec 2020 [8:44 AM], both attached to Annex A
hereto.
In view of the foregoing, this is to inform you that ADMC reserves its right to claim for an Extension of
Time and reimbursement of any associated costs attributable to such delaying event(s), inclusive of any
disruptive costs resulting from loss of productivity and/or idle manpower.
Meanwhile, we continue to comply with our contractual obligations with respect to the mitigation
measures in coordination with ABJV, for minimizing any associated delays and/or costs.
Nevertheless, it is also imperative to avoid having similar incidents in the future, thus we kindly request
you to take whatever actions are required on your part to avoid the reoccurrence of crane unavailability
accordingly. This will ensure that we can jointly continue expeditiously with the works, while minimizing
further delays and/or costs to this project.
Yours faithfully,
