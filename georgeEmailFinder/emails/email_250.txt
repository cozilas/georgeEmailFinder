Subject:Clause 27.1.1: Notice of Claim – Delay Notice No. 0185
Subsidence Rectification Works – Heaving to Pier 2 (MV Chamber and Grease
Interceptor Pit) and Pier 4 (Earth Pits and GSE Road to GH38-GH39, and Sewer Manholes, S2307A and
S2308A) – Request for Engineer’s Instruction
Dear Sir
We refer to the recent e-mails exchanged between us in the period from 19 November 2019 and 16
December 2019 [copies attached] associated with the observance of heaving to the ground levels and /
or various chambers, pits and manholes adjacent to Piers 2 and 4, following grouting works.
Specifically, we write with reference to the following:
1.
Head of Pier 2 – GH10-GH11, MV chamber;
2.
Pier 2-GH19, Grease interceptor GIP 02;
3.
Pier 4- GH38-GH39 ,earth pits and GSE road; and
4.
Head of pier 4 area (sewer manholes S2307A and S2308A areas).
Details pertaining to each of these areas and the content of our related e-mails are described below:
(1)
Head of Pier 2 – GH10-GH11, MV Chamber
In our e-mail dated 12 December 2019 [4:15 PM] we advised you of the following:
“… we noticed that the MV chamber at head of pier 2 (L&T scope) start to heave with a few block points
and permeation grout points as highlighted in attached layout ... [we further record that] the calculated
weight of the chamber [is] approximately 200 Tons without taken in[to] consideration the top part of
the chamber …
We hereby submitting the site records for drilled points around the chamber with the blocked and
grouted points for your review and providing the required design method of grouting the area around
the MV chamber.
We would like to remind you that BAUER are employed through TCAJV for work execution not for design
purposes, the design responsibility remain under CMA & NACO which they must supply the contractor
with the suitable design.”
(2)
Pier 2-GH19, Grease Interceptor GIP 02
In our e-mail dated 14 December 2019 [5:12 PM] we advised you of the following:

“Please be noted that we observed heave on the GIP02 near gatehouse 19 (refer to attached e-mail
from BAUER). Could you please review and advise the way forward to continue the required grouting
works at mentioned area.
This for your information, records and actions.”
(3)
Pier 4- GH38-GH39, Earth Pits and GSE Road
In our e-mail dated 24 November 2019 [2:12 PM] we provided by way of any attachment “an as-built
survey after grouting for the top of earth pit manholes and curbstones between GH38 & GH39.”
This was forwarded on to the Employer’s Specialist Engineering Consultants (RHDHV) by way of your email dated 27 November 2019 [9:40 AM] advising them of the following:
“Please see attached surveys carried out which indicate the heave experienced at the Earth Pits within
GH 38-39 (S2301-S2301A).
The above is for your information and feedback.”
(4)
Head of Pier 4 area (Sewer Manholes S2307A and S2308A areas)
While there is no definitive e-mail available on this matter, we know that you have been made aware of
the heave to the head of Pier 4 through daily survey works and reports, which caused you to issue us
Site Memo No: MTC-CMA-0401-QC-MEM-03404, dated 11 December 2019, which states:
“CMA have observed pavement lift and heave along Gatehouses 38, 39 (earth pits area) and 36
(inundation area) on the GSE Road, concrete barriers along GH 19 and 36 access area and L& T MV
Chamber at GH 11. These heave has been physically observed in several areas of permanent works
during and after the permeation grouting of the area.
This also advises us of the following ‘Requirements’ in so far as we are required to:
1.
Ensure all permanent underground utilities installed and completed on these areas should be
properly monitored and any level deviations shall be reported to CMA.
2.
Exercise effective monitor in order to minimize unwanted movements on the completed works.
3.
Any damages, including other contractors completed works, occurred due to these heave
movements shall be rectified, reinstated and tested and will be submitted though WIR for CMA
approval.
The amount of deviation in levels identified in the ground levels and / or various chambers, pits and
manholes adjacent to Piers 2 and 4 varies significantly. By way of specific example, recent findings of
the heave to Grease Interceptor GIP 02 adjacent GH19 to Pier 2, indicates that it has heaved +47mm.
We have, by virtue of our various communications, meetings and discussions, as well as by way of our emails including those described above, together with accompanying survey reports, informed you of all
level deviations in order for you to instruct us. However, at the date of preparing this notice (18
December 2019), you have failed to do so. It is for this reason that we raise this E-Notice No. 0185.
We again remind you that we are not the designers for this Project, the Employer’s Design Consultant is,
and it is their responsibility, under your guidance, to provide us with the design of the subsidence
remediation measure. As such we are dependent upon being provided critical design information in a
timely and prompt manner, not just for the principle remediation measures but also to address issues
such as those identified herein as soon as they arise. It is therefore essential that we receive a fully
designed, complete and properly instructed Issued for Construction set of documentation, reflecting the
Employer’s Design Consultant’s recommendations to address the heaving identified herein.
Until such time as we are in receipt of the same, then we are prevented from completing the grouting
works to the notes areas to Piers 1 and 4. This will delay the Time for Completion of the Works.
To conclude therefore, it is our contention that the various events and circumstances outlined above
constitutes acts of prevention and/or breach of Contract on the part of the Employer and / or the
Employer’s Personnel and / or the Consultants, and accordingly we hereby give you notice, pursuant to
Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1, of our right to claim:
(i)
An extension to the Time for Completion pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c); and

(ii)
An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.1 pursuant to Clause 9.10, or,
in the alternative, damages for breach of contract.
Interim and/or final details of the Time Impacts and adjustments to the Contract Price relating to this
event will be provided in due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.5(a), (b) and (c).
Yours faithfully,
