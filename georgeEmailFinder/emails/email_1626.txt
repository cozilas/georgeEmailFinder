Dear Sir,

The Contractor is once again in receipt of a letter alleging unacceptable and unsafe practices regarding
its tunneling operations. written by agents who not only are clearly not qualified to comment on these
methods and processes but whose knee-jerk reactions are seriously damaging the credibility of the
technical oversight to which the Contractor's works are subject.

Contrary to what is stated in the referenced Engineer's Assistant's letter, steel set No 47 has not been
eliminated but has been replaced by built-up mining support elements of equivalent strength, posing no

risk whatsoever to mining activities. The installation of this system is even clearly visible in the
photograph attached to the referenced letter .

Firstly, the increased step of 2.5m at the breakthrough location was foreseeable as the last excavation
step connecting the two mined tunnels advancing from Entrance 1 and 2.

Secondly, the replacement of steel rib No. 47 with additional steel mesh and rock bolts. has been based
on the fundamental principles of tunnelling, international best practice and the experience of the
Contractor and Designer on Site. More specifically, the replacement of the steel rib has been undertaken
by substituting an equivalent support system (additional steel mesh and rock bolts), which are described
in detail in the DVE certified M006-GDB-CON-FCR-00497 issued on the 25/05/2017 and transmitted to
PMC and QR on the 27/05/2017 through M006-GDB-INFM-028431 , both by empirical (Barton,
Bieniawski, Rabcewicz, etc) and analytical methods (Rock Support Interaction Analysis).

It must be noted that the replacement of the steel rib with the equivalent additional support measures
never created a risk either to the personnel or to the structure itself. NATM is an observational method
and the support measures can be modified on site by adopting either heavier, lighter or equivalent
support measures than those described in the design following the assessment of the Designer on Site,
based on the in-situ conditions (geotechnical, loading and monitoring records).

Moreover, after the replacement of the rib with the rock bolts and wire mesh, the settlements on the
surface above the tunnels' seam are fully stabilized at total values less than 1O mm, which are in
accordance with the design provisions and less than those measured above the rest of the tunnel,
further justifying the choice of local support structure.

Thus, the Contractor refutes statements such as "Improper Installation" or "unsafe acts and practices"
or " ...unsafe conditions" contained within the referenced letter as being baseless and untrue. The "high
risk situation" was never such, and the DYE-certified technical note was prepared and sent to the
Engineer's Assistant 3 days prior to receipt of the reference letter .

The reference FCR document (M006-GDB-CON-FCR-00497) , has been officially submitted to Engineer's
Assistance as DVE certified on the 1st of June 2017 under WF 14882.

Yours faithfully,
