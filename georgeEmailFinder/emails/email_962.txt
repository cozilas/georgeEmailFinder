Subject RE: Additional Cost for Revision of Model and Additional Mould for Slab Edge@
Dear Sir,
North & South Retail Over lift Curved Area
The Contractor confirms receipt of letter reference (1) wherein the Subcontractor requests an additional
payment of AED 22,300.00 for allegedly revising its model and procuring two additional moulds for the
slab
edges at both north and south retail over lift curved areas.
In relation to the Subcontractor's claim that two additional moulds (one for the south and one for north)
had
to be procured in order to fabricate 'two half panels with recesses', the Contractor notes that the
original IFC
I Contract drawings already showed two panels at each of the over lift curved areas. It was due to
Subcontractor's request via RFI No. 12410 that the joint between the two curved panels was removed
making
one large curved slab edge panel. A while after the Subcontractor contended that its production
methodology
could not fabricate one single large curved panel and requested approval for fabricating the said curved
panel
in two halves (RFI No. 13249).
In other words, the Contractor confirms that the number of panels, and therefore the number of
moulds,
required to execute the curved over lift areas remained unchanged if compa red with the IFC I Contract

drawings. Moreover, the changes in the arrangement of the panels were, in all instances, proposed by
the
Subcontractor to better suit its production I installation methodology. Therefore, the Contractor is of
the
opinion that, unless demonstrated otherwise, the Subcontractor should not be compensated for the
additional works claimed in its submission (1).
Yours faithfully
