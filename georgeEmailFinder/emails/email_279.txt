Engineer’s Response to RFI/0401/17582 – Introduction of Galvanised Steel Plates to North and South
Pavilions – Request for Engineer’s Instruction (EI) and Variation Order (VO) in order to integrate
Variation / Change into Works

Dear Sirs,
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
Your response to RFI/0401/17582 detailed in Annex A hereto, represents a change in design and scope
and requires a valid EI and VO in order for us to integrate the same into the Works.
Potential Impact
Delay and disruption due to the events and circumstances outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
likely to impact on the achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within seven (7) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
On 22 October 2019, a Mechanical Works Completion Inspection (MCI) of the Sprinkler System to Room
‘CS-10 Zone’ located at CP North Pavilion Sector Nos 5.11C, 5.11D, 5.16B between Level L2.0 and Level
L3.0, was undertaken by the Employer’s Fire Life Safety Consultant (Messrs Profire). Their inspection
report, i.e. ‘WIR Number PF MCI-SUP-191022-CP L2.0 TO L3.0 CS-10 Iteration 10, Revision 02’, issued by
way of their letter reference 191022-PF-IR-31809-GM [also dated 22 October 2019] addressed to the
Employer (ADAC), identified a limited number of three (3) ‘findings’. This included but was not limited
to the following comment in relation to the entire grading platform area:
“Contractor to provide checkered steel plate [to the] entire grading platform area (all areas applicable).”
[Bold and underlined for emphasis]
Attached to Profire’s letter were a series of photos, including without limitation the photos that are
reproduced in Figure 1 below, which amongst other things, shows the grading platform area.

Profire’s MCI report (WIR Number PF MCI-SUP-191022-CP L2.0 TO L3.0 CS-10 Iteration 10, Revision 02’),
dated 22 October 2019 concluded with the following result (reproduced in Figure 2 below):
Figure 2 – Result from Profire’s Inspection dated 22 October 2019
Interestingly, the day prior to the above noted inspection, i.e. on 21 October 2019, Profire issued an
earlier MCI report (WIR Number PF MCI-SUP-191021-CP L3 CS-53) relating to the Sprinkler System to
Room ‘CS-53 Zone’ located at CP South Pavilion Sector Nos 5.19D and 5.24B to Level L3.0, by way of
their letter reference 191021-PF-IR-31789-JM [also dated 21 October 2019]. Despite this MCI report
listing five (5) findings, there is no reference to the requirement to provide checkered steel plate.
This anomaly caused us to raise RFI/0401/17582 Rev. 00 on 5 November 2019, titled ‘MCI comment to
add steel checkered plates above north pavilion roof’ advising you of the following (Figure 3):
Figure 3 – Question detailed within RFI/0401/17582
Attached to RFI/0401/17582 Rev. 00 were the following attachments:

•
A copy of Profire’s letter ref: 191022-PF-IR-31809-GM dated 22 October 2019 wherein Profire
has provided the MCI report and photos (Figure 1 refers) from the inspection held on 22 October 2019
at CP North Pavilion Sectors 5.11C, 5.11D, 5.16B, to Levels L2.0 to L3.0.
•
A copy of Profire’s letter ref: 191021-PF-IR-31789-JM dated 21 October 2019, wherein Profire
has provided the MCI report and enclosed photos from another MCI held on 21 October at CP South
Pavilion Sectors 5.19D, 5.24B Level 3.0 Room CS 53 Zone.
We requested a response to RFI/0401/17582 by 13 November 2019. However, at that date you failed to
reply. We did however receive an ‘advanced’ response on or about 19 November 2019.
Notwithstanding the delay in responding, the Employer’s Design Consultant confirmed the following:
“Based on the proposed sprinkler system by the contractor per ADAC-AHJ & HOE, the areas where the
grating is located need to be comply with NFPA hence ceiling to be provided accordingly. Contractor to
provide galvanized steel plate underneath the grating area of North and South pavilions to provide a
ceiling for up-right sprinkler operation. Contractor to submit relevant shop drawings, MS and DS for
review accordingly. Code compliance – No time/cost.” [Bold and underlined for emphasis]
In this regard, we record that the works associated with the grading platform at the North and South
Pavilions have been competed based on IFC Drawings prepared by the Employer’s Design Consultant
and issued by you. Shop Drawings representing the IFC scope have been approved by you also. Given
the approved Design, there is no requirement to install galvanized steel plates underneath the grating
area to the North and South pavilions as advised in the advance response to RFI/0401/17582.
Nevertheless, it is evidently clear that this requirement has been insisted upon by Profire (HOE / AHJ)
and the need to “…to provide galvanized steel plate underneath the grating area of North and South
pavilions to provide a ceiling for up-right sprinkler operation”, represent a change to the IFC Design. This
is not a ‘code compliance’ issue for which we are purportedly responsible, as implied from your advance
reply to RFI/0401/17582, and moreover, there will be additional time and cost impacts.
As you know, SAA8 laid down strict guidelines to follow if additional works are required and this appears
to have been ignored. Hence this change will warrant a valid Engineer’s Instruction (EI) and a Variation
Order (VO) if you require us to proceed with integrating the revised scope into the Works.
We therefore take this opportunity in also reminding you of the provisions of Clauses 2.29 to 2.31 of
Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’) pertaining to Variations, in so far as we are not to
proceed with any Variation unless a Variation Order and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. In
which respect, it is your obligation to issue this Record first if you wish to instigate change; this is only
after the additional time and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.
Meanwhile, until such time as you take the action required of you in accordance with the express
requirements of SAA8, we are unable to proceed with implementing the changes noted above and will
continue to proceed in accordance with the existing IFC design to the extent we are able to.
Yours faithfully,
