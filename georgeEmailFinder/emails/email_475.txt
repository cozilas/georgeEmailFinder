Subject:Omission of Slot Louvres at Level 2.0 and 3.0
Dear Sir,
We write in continuation to our Notices referenced (2, 3, 4 & 5) above to clarify the works omitted from
your scope of works.
Further to our instruction via email (enclosed), we hereby confirm that we have elected to omit the
sections of Subcontract Works pursuant to Subcontract Clause 22.2.4 [Termination by Contractor for
Subcontractor Default], as identified in the highlighted drawings (enclosed within this Notice), and we
expressly reserve the right to subsequently notify you of further omissions of sections of the
Subcontract Works.
The Contractor’s right to omit a section(s) pursuant to Clause 22.2.4 shall be without prejudice to the
Contractor’s right any time to omit any part or section(s) of the Works pursuant to clause 20.1 (Right to
Vary) but shall not be subject to any restrictions on giving of such omitted work to another
Subcontractor any time. In the event of such omission, the Subcontractor shall have no claims for loss of
profit or contribution to overheads.

The omissions of sections of the Subcontract Works are without prejudice to all of our other rights under
the Subcontract, including our right to instruct further subsequent omissions.
We trust you find the above self-explanatory and we look forward to your continued action and support
on this project.

Yours faithfully,
