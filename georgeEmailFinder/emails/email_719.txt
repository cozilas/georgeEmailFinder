Re: Delay Notice for Cleared Area

Dear Sir,
With reference to the above subject and in continuation to your letter referenced (1) above, we hereby
inform you that the content of your said letter is refuted. Please be informed that there were enough
available work-fronts/areas for you to proceed. The available work-front areas were as follows:
GH 38, GH 39, GH 40, GH 41, GH 42, GH 43, and GH 45
In addition to the above and to address the issue raised in your mentioned letter, please note that due
to your failure to proceed timeously with the works in Gatehouse 44, other trades commenced with
their works. Had you commenced with the works without delay, the area would have been available
without any obstructions.
Also, you are requested to coordinate your works in a proper sequence by means of continuous
communication with our construction team and other Subcontractors, to ensure the timely
commencement and completion of the works.
We always remain available to assist you by all possible means to progress in all areas satisfactorily and
ensure that the target programme dates are met throughout the project. As mentioned above, this can
only be done with your cooperation and adequate communication which in some cases is not sufficient.
This is for your information and records.
Yours faithfully,
