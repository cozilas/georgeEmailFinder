Subject Delay Notification - Concerns Over Site Based Resources due to Strike Action and
Declining Staff Numbers
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to above and to highlight our concern over the recent TCAJV's labour strikes
that has significantly reduced the site based manpower. We understand that approximately 2,000 site
based operatives have withdrawn from site from 11th September 2019 and this position remained
until 14 September 2019. This has resulted in vast areas of the site being completely un-resourced at
this critical time of the Project.
We wish to further highlight our serious concerns on the rapid decline of site based resources over
recent weeks. As can be seen in the table below, the Contractor's total workforce has decreased by
approximately 3,000 people since mid-August 2019 of which the number of Sub-contractor's

employees has fallen by approximately 2,500 people representing a reduction of 34%. This is
concerning given the extent of works outstanding and the aggressive schedule to complete the
Project. It is imperative that the Contractor immediately takes steps to dramatically increase their site
based resources with suitably skilled and experienced staff and requisite site supervision/
management teams to drive the Project to the Completion Date.
We hereby reserve the Employer's rights pursuant to Clause 10.3 of the Conditions of Contract for all
delays and damages that may be incurred as a result of the Contractor's delays and inactions.
Yours faithfully,
