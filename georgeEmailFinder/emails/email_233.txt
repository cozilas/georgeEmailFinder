Subject:Post SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0194
Delays & Additional Costs associated with Removal of NAFFCO’s Installed Fire Extinguisher Cabinets at
Pier 4 Level 1.0 MOFA Lounge 1744 by Employer’s Other Contractors – Request for Engineer’s
Instruction / Variation Order
Dear Sirs,
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
The information described in Annex A hereto records events associated with delays attributable to
damages caused by the Employer’s Other Contractors to our previously installed Fire Extinguishers

Cabinets at Pier 4 Level 1.0 MOFA Lounge 1744. This will require rectification works and accordingly will
require an Engineer’s Instruction (EI) and Variation Order (VO) in order for us to do so.
Potential Impact
Disruptions and delays caused by others such as that outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
increasingly likely to impact on achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within seven (7) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
On 30 December 2019 we received letter dated 29 December 2019 (ref: MTB/PCEJV/TCAJV/L/05756),
from our Mechanical Works Subcontractor (M/s PCE JV), enclosing a letter from their subcontractor,
M/s NAFFCO dated 19 December 2019 (ref: NF/SUB/DOC/N432/19122019), collectively notifying us of
additional works and associated costs arising in consequence of the Employer’s Fit-Out Contractors
having removed the previously installed Fire Extinguisher Cabinets at Pier 4 L1.0 MOFA Lounge 1744.
In support of the foregoing events, we provide the following attachments:
1.
Annex A: This narrative providing a ‘Description of the Event’;
2.
Annex B: ‘PCEJV’s ‘Notification’ and accompanying letter from NAFFCO’; and
3.
Annex C: ‘Site Observation Report’.
Despite the Fire Extinguisher Cabinets having been installed, inspected and handed over vide the WIR
process, the Employer’s Fit-Out Contractors have simply removed the Fire Extinguisher Cabinets without
requesting permission or notifying us [PCE JV / NAFFCO / TCA JV] of their intention to do so.
A copy of PCE JV’s ‘Notification’ and accompanying letter from NAFFCO [the latter attaching a series of
photographs as well as an internal e-mail dated 17 December 2019, advising of the following issues
pertaining to the previously installed Fire Extinguisher Cabinets], is attached for reference:
1.
Most of the extinguishers and fire protection cabinets were removed / detached from the wall
by the Employer’s Other Contractor [internal fitting out] as a result of room modifications;
2.
The remaining extinguisher and fire protection cabinet that is still fixed in its original location is
now hidden inside a small room; and
3.
The MOFA Lounge Room 1744 has been greatly modified by the Employer’s Other Contractor
[internal fitting out] with the addition of partitions rendering the cabinets location unsuitable.
In view of the above and the content of the attached letter, it is evidently clear that the events and
circumstances cited herein are not of our doing or responsibility, and any rectification / remedial works
necessarily required to remedy the Fire Extinguisher Cabinets will invariably delay us.
We therefore inform you that we will require a Variation Order (VO) / Engineer’s Instruction (EI) in order
for us to undertake any rectification works. SAA8 laid down strict guidelines to follow in the event that
additional works are required and therefore request you to issue the necessary VO / EI for the requisite
works to be undertaken. We also ask that you take appropriate action to prevent any further occurrence
of damages to previously handed-over Works by Employer’s Other Contractors.
Yours faithfully,
