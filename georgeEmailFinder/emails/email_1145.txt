Subject:List of Agreed RFVO’s - Finishes
Dear Sir,
With reference to the above subject, please find attached list of agreed RFVO’s which have been
submitted in order for the Engineer to issue Variation Orders respectively. Please be informed that all
RFVO’s included in the enclosed list have been jointly assessed, reconciled and agreed since May 2013
up to December 2017, however, the fact remains that to date no Variation Order has been issued for the
listed RFVO’s.
In view of the above and due to the fact that the release of a Variation Order accordingly is long
overdue, pursuant to Contract Clauses 20.3.2 [Variation Procedure] and 11.4.1 [Determinations], we
pursue our contractual rights and kindly request your early determination and issuance of formal
Variation Orders correspondingly. Moreover, we kindly request that such determination and issuance is
within 14 days of receipt of this letter as required by Clause 11.4.1.

We hereby request for your immediate and necessary action for the issuance of these Variation Orders.
Yours faithfully,
