Subject:Clause 27.1.1: Notice of Claim – Delay Notice No. 269 [post-SAA8]
Delayed Confirmation of Required Grout Work Verification Boreholes to Pier 2
Dear Sirs,
On 7 April 2020 (ref: 1), we e-mailed the Employer’s Geotechnical Consultant (RHDHV) requesting their
confirmation of the indicative locations of the remaining Verification Boreholes (VBH) to Pier 2 indicated
on the attachment appended thereto. Following which, on 9 April 2020 (ref: 2), RHDHV responded and

amongst other things requested confirmation of some missing grouting records. We complied and on
13 April 2020 (ref: 3), forwarded a response from BAUER and accordingly requested “review and
feedback.”
However, despite issuing a succession of e-mails to RHDHV and you, requesting approval of the
suggested VBH’s for remaining areas to Pier 2, including without limitation our e-mails dated 11 April
2020 [8:24 AM], 26 April 2020 [10:11 AM], 7 May 2020 [9:10 AM], and 14 May 2020 [11:57 AM] (ref: 4),
you failed to reply.
In our last e-mail (ref: 4), made it patently clear that if you fail to reply [promptly] and provide
confirmation / approval of the required VBH’s to Pier 2, we would have no option but to demobilize our
geotechnical subcontractor company (Al Hai Mukkadam) in order to avoid incurring additional costs of
idle time due to your failure to provide any further directives on the matter, despite our repeated
requests that you do so.
Once again however, despite our further request for “prompt actions and feedback”, you failed to reply.
Therefore, in light of the successive acts of prevention described above, we hereby give you notice,
pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1, of our right to claim:
(i)
An extension to the Time for Completion pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c); and
(ii)
An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.1 pursuant to Clause 9.10, or,
in the alternative, damages for breach of contract.
Interim and/or final details of the Time Impacts and adjustments to the Contract Price relating to this
event will be provided in due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.5(a), (b) and (c).
Yours faithfully,
