Subject Engineer's Notification of Delay in Central Processor and Pier 2 FOB's Form 4
Submission Energization

We write with reference to correspondence (1) regarding the delays to the submission of FDB Form 4
energization in the Central Processor and Pier 2.
The Engineer via numerous correspondence (2) to (10) has highlighted the delays that are attributed
to the wire joints rectification work, uncoordinated Testing and Commissioning schedule and the
shortage of the Contractor's resources.
Furthermore, the Contractor is reminded that any changes that are driven by the requirement of the
Local Authority (ADDC) are the Contractor's obligation in accordance with the Project Specification,
Section 260500 (copy attached), and thus the Contractor has no entitlement to any additional time
and/or cost associated for complying with the Authority Having Jurisdiction's requirements.
In light of the above, the directions provided by the Local Authority cannot be construed as a
Va riat ion. The Engineer retains the posit ion that all claims by the Co ntract or have been disapproved
and no entitlement was found.
Yours faithfully,
