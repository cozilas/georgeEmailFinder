Subject MV Electrical Maintenance Contractor
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence (1) regard ing the Contractor's request for the Employer to
provide the contact details of the party responsible for the FM maintenance of the MV Electrical
Works and we remind the Contractor that the Defects Liability Period commences once the works
have been Taken Over by the Employer.
Until such time the Contractor completes the Works in accordance with the Contract and the
Employer issues a Taking Over Certificate, these works remain the responsibility of the Contractor.
We trust the above has clarified the issue and we assure the Contractor that prior to the
commencement of the Defects Liability Period, the details of the responsible party shall be forwarded
to the Contractor.
Yours faithfully,
