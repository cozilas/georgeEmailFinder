Subject RFVO's - Extended Dates
Dear Sir,
The Engineer acknowledges receipt of the Contractor's RFVO's (1) and (2), however it is our position
that the Contractor does not have any entitlement for additional cost for these works under the
Variation Clause.

Should the Contractor believe it has an entitlement for additional cost then it is required to follow the
contractual process under Clause 27.1 of the Conditions of Contract.
Please withdraw these RFVO's accordingly.
Yours faithfully,
