Subject: Subsidence - lack of complete and coordinated economic and appropriate design solution to the
subsidence of the sewer and storm-water
Dear Sirs,
infrastructure: suspend further works
We refer to the above noted letters to which we have not yet received any response and regret
that in the best interests of all Parties and stakeholders, we must now act upon our proposal to
allow time to receive and then act upon a complete design for these remedial works.
We have significantly increased resources and mobilised specialist subcontractors on the premise
that the promised full IFC details would have been instructed by the Engineer at the beginning of
July: at the time of writing we are still waiting for this data with the latest information being that
further detail should be issued by 18 July 2019.
It is commendable that our teams on site should try to utilise standing assets mobilised in the spirit
of continuing cooperation and progress: But without a comprehensive and coordinated design that
allows time to properly programme, resource and sequence works, not only are abortive works
being carried out but such works may actually obstruct future construction once designs are
clarified.
We confirm therefore that we have suspended all further site works in respect of subsidence
remedials and await receipt of the Engineer's fully detailed and complete proposals, upon receipt
of which we shall take appropriate action.
Yours faithfully,
