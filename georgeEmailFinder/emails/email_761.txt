Dear Sirs,
In reference to the above subject matter, and our letter ref. MTB- SMC-TCAJV.L-0015 dated 11.01.2018
for which we have till date not received an confirmation receipt in this matter, we would just like to
once
again bring to your attention in advance that it is of imperative importance to note that in order for us
to
manufacture our Roller Blinds for all required window opening, all window must be ready from
preceding
disciplines i.e ceiling, plasterboard and stone cladding as site measurements for each opening require to
be
taken separately in order to accurately manufacture the Roller Blinds to fit each and every window
opening.
Furthermore, please note that the approximate time required for taking final site measurements,
manufacturing the blinds and delivering the blinds to site will take approximately 13 weeks.
Yours faithfully,
