Subject:Post SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0121
Kitchen & Smoke Extract Fan Installation in Hotel Building Level L3.4

Response to RFI/00401/17163 and SDS/0401/M/1375-01
Dear Sirs,
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
The matters described in Annex A concern delays to completion of the Works due to various acts of
prevention on the part of the Employer’s Personnel and / or the Consultants that will require a revised
response to RFI/00401/17163 and the re-coding of SDS/0401/M/1375-01 in order to resolve.
Potential Impact
Delay and disruption due to the events and circumstances outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
likely to impact on achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within seven (7) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
On 26 May 2019, we raised a Field Modification Request (FMR) by way of RFI/0401/17163, in which,
with reference to the Hotel - Building Management Mechanical Rooms – advised of the following:
‘The kitchen extract fan is mounted to a floating slab which as per the attached detail sketch BP 10 is
1000mmmm and the Cork sheet surrounding the floating slab is 100mm (50mm from each side).
However and as per site conditions, the floating slab is 890mm and the cork sheet 210mm (105 from
each side). Kindly confirm’
Attached was a marked up sketch from Briefing Pack 10 titled ‘Hotel - Building Management Mechanical
Rooms Layout’, Sketch No. 401-JV-BP10-34-5.00-GA-SKFC-002_R00_220817 [BP ref: sketch ‘ASK-008
(BP10)’, IFC ref: MTC A 02 TB_L3.4 5.32 00.846] (refer to Figure 1), plus a partial extract of the same
showing the variance between what is indicated thereupon and that which is ‘per site conditions’ and
the subject of our FMR (refer to Figure 2 below).
Figure 1
Figure 2
It is important to point out that sketch ‘ASK-008 (BP10) was signed by you on 16 October 2017.
We requested a response to RFI/0401/17163 by 2 June 2019. You failed to reply until 26 June 2019 (ref:
1). Further, rather than address the question being asked, KPF replied in the following manner:
‘The contractor's proposal and the provided detail are not acceptable. As commented on the response
of SDS-0401-M-1375-00 and 01 which are reviewed as Code 3, the details shown on the drawing are not
in accordance with the workshops/agreements made during BP-10 and noted in the CMIRs, i.e. BP10ACSK-001. As per BP-10 the Contractor should be following the detail shown on BP10-ACSK-001
(attached to the response for ease of reference). This detail was developed to prevent noise breakout
from the fan into the Central Processor and Hotel Building.’

In addition to enclosing a Change Management Information Request (CMIR) dated 7 March 2016, also
attached to the response to RFI/0401/17163 was a copy of Sketch No. BP10-ACSK-001 entitled ‘Hotel
Roof Fan Room – Acoustic Requirements’. We note this is dated 29 February 2016 (Figure 3 refers).
Figure 3
We make the following comments and observations in respect of the above:
1.
We are somewhat surprised at KPF’s reference to an out of date sketch, given that Sketch No.
BP10-ACSK-001 (Figure 3 refers) to which KPF refer is dated 29 February 2016 and was for all intents
superseded by ‘ASK-008 (BP10)’ (Figure 1 refers) dated 16 October 2017.
2.
Moreover, given that ‘ASK-008 (BP10)’ was signed off as agreed by various parties, including you
– as the Engineer for the Project – on 16 October 2017, in keeping with the Briefing Pack design
development process [in so far as we were to instructed generally at the outset of the Briefing Pack
design development process to consider signed-off BP sketches as ‘issued for construction’], we
complied and constructed the works on site according to that sketch.
3.
Moreover, according to a series of e-mails exchanged between 7 June 2017 and 13 September
2017 [copies attached, ref: (2)] the mechanical fan room sketch [which was later to become ‘ASK-008
(BP10)’] was widely circulated to all parties and at no time was challenged by KPF, or any other party for
that matter; including for example, neither you nor ARUP.
4.
Meanwhile, on 31 December 2018, we received a Status Code 3 response to our Shop Drawing,
Fan Typical Installation Details for KEF-CS-L3.4-02 and 03, SEF-CS-L3.4-01 (Sector 5.32B) issued under
Shop Drawing Submittal No: SDS/0401/M/1375-01 (ref: 3) the basis of the rejection being that the fan
details were purportedly not in accordance with BP10-ACSK-001 – which we have established above,
was superseded by ‘ASK-008 (BP10)’ (refer to Figure 1).
5.
Under the circumstances we believe the Status Code 3 comments to be invalid and urge you to
assist with arranging to have SDS/0401/M/1375-01 re-coded as minimum Status Code 2.
In addition to the above, we received an e-mail from you dated 3 July 2019 [timed at 6:42pm] which
provided two e-mails from the Employer’s Design Consultant [ARUP] one of which was dated 17 June
2017 and one dated 3 July 2019, which in summary stated that following a review of the sketch detail
appended to RFI/0401/17163 i.e. ‘ASK-008 (BP10)’ (Figure 1), ARUP advised that they were of the view
that “the current as built configuration will not achieve the IFC intent” and “Reverberant noise will be
transmitted to the Hotel resulting in noise levels above the target of NR35 for bedrooms.” ARUP further
stated that they recommended that we either implement the detail shown upon BP10-ACSK-001 (Figure
3 refers), or provide an alternative solution which they opine meets the IFC design intent complete with
all supporting documents, including the provision of acoustic calculations.
This triggered a further round of e-mails between us [copied to KPF and ARUP] up to 25 July 2019
[copies of the e-mails issued from 17 June 2017 to 25 July 2019 are included, ref: (4)], during which we
agreed to undertake sound measurements to establish whether the IFC design intent to the affected
Hotel Fan Rooms had been achieved or otherwise. Our e-mails dated 18 July 2019 and 25 July 2019
confirm that the readings from the noise measurements taken at different levels in the Hotel Building
confirm that they are “within the design requirement range of NR35”, and this “proves that the detail
provided in RFI-17163 prevents noise breakout in the Hotel building.”
In view of the above, we request that (1) you issue a revised response to RFI/0401/17163 correcting the
reference to an out of date sketch and that you properly address the FMR described therein; and (2),
you re-code the current response to SDS/0401/M/1375-01 as minimum Status Code 2.
However, until such time as you do so, we are prevented from completing our Works to the Hotel Fan
Rooms to Level L3.4 which is preventing the sign-off of the related Work Inspection Request (WIR).
Resultant Impact:

The delays to completion of the aforementioned works and delays to sign-off of the related WIR will at
such a late stage of the project, cause delay and disruption to our works. This has the potential to
invariably knock on to testing and commissioning and impact upon our ability to achieve Milestone
MS09B, and may also prevent us from achieving Substantial Completion (i.e. Milestone MS09C).
Action Required:
It is for this reason therefore that we issue this E-Notice requesting your prompt action, guidance,
decision or further instruction as may be applicable to resolve the matters referenced herein in order to
mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works. This includes without limitation:
1.
Issuing a revised response to RFI/0401/17163 in the manner identified above; and
2.
Re-coding the current response to SDS/0401/M/1375-01 to Status Code 2.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within seven (7) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Yours faithfully,
