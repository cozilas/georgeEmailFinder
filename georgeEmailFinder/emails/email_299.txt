Subject: Response to the Subcontractor's Claim#21 - Loss of Manpower due to Abu Dhabi Police Traffic
Precaution on Foggy Weather
Dear Sir,
We write in response to the Subcontractor's Claim#21 for loss of manpower due to Abu Dhabi Police
traffic precaution on foggy weather, submitted via the letter reference: (1) above, and reject it based on
the following grounds:
• The claim is not sufficiently defined for the Contractor's review and assessment, as the Subcontractor
has failed to establish its entitlement to additional payment under the provisions of the Subcontract or
otherwise.
• Furthermore, the Subcontractor has failed to comply with the notice requirement under SubClause
27.1 [Subcontractor's Claims] of the Conditions of Subcontract.
• Notwithstanding the above, the event that has led the Abu Dhabi Police to take traffic precautions is
foggy weather condition, which is predictable during this time of the year in Abu Dhabi. As such, the
Subcontractor should have provided against such weather conditions in its programme.

• Moreover, we remind the Subcontractor that it is Subcontractor's responsibility to ensure the safety of
its personnel.
In light of the above, we reject the Subcontractor's Claim#21 for loss of manpower due to Abu Dhabi
Police traffic precaution on foggy weather, in its entirety.
Thank you.
Yours faithfully,
