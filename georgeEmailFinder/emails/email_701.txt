Subject:Initial Review of the Subcontractor’s Extension of Time Claim No.4
Dear Sir/Madam,
Further to the Subcontractor’s letter reference (1) above, wherein the Subcontractor has submitted its
interim claim no.4 for an extension of time and additional costs; the Contractor’s comments are as
follows:
1.
The Subcontractor has failed to demonstrate contractual compliance in its claim. For example:
a.
the Subcontractor only relies upon weekly reports for contractual compliance, no other
documents have been provided to support the alleged delay events;

b.
the Subcontractor’s delay event narratives should contain (but do not) contractually compliant
references to exhibits such as, timely delay notices, relevant correspondence, minutes of meetings, etc.;
2.
The Subcontractor’s delay analysis methodology is acceptable in name only (Time Impact
Analysis ‘TIA’); it has been poorly executed and is fatally flawed/not fit for purpose. Examples of
unacceptable practices within the Subcontractor’s TIA are; a.
Delay events/fragnets which extend long after the claimed delay period/time slice or window,
some extending to December 2018, i.e. theoretical beyond what is acceptable in a TIA.
b.
The Subcontractor states that it has made amendments to its progress updates whilst preparing
the delay analysis. However, these changes are not listed or explained within the Subcontractor’s Claim
No.4 submission.
c.
The Subcontractor has presented Claim No.4 as two ‘windows’; i.
Window 1 starts January 2018 and ends March 2018 with an impacted completion to 25
September 2019;
ii.
There is no TIA analysis/window for the period April 2018 to June 2018 (however the events
relied upon in the narrative span January 2018 to August 2018);
iii.
Window 2 starts in July 2018 and ends in August 2018 with an impacted completion of 6th
August 2019; which is an earlier impacted completion than Window 1;
iv.
The Subcontractor has requested an Extension of Time based on the impacted completion of
Window 1. However, the final window shows the consolidated impacted completion date. Therefore,
the EOT claimed should not be more than that shown in Window 2.
d.
The impacted programmes contain actual dates after the cut-off date (data date); these should
be corrected/removed as appropriate.
e.
The impacted programmes contain constraints, which should be reviewed and wherever
possible removed, and an explanation must be provided, as to the effect of retaining or removing the
constraint(s).
f.
Notwithstanding issues of causation and substantiation of the events, the Subcontractor’s
submission fails on the basis of a preliminary technical review of its TIA methodology.
3.
The Subcontractor’s claim nos. 2 and 3 - submitted via references (2) and (3) respectively - also
failed to provide acceptable delay analyses. For example, the Subcontractor’s submissions do not
consider the full period of its subcontract period following EOT1 (refer table below).

Refer item 2.c.ii
The Subcontractor is kindly requested to provide the abovementioned information (including where
appropriate soft copies such as Primavera P6.XER files) and re-submit its claim as soon as practicably
possible, to enable the Contractor to perform a detailed review of the Subcontractor’s entitlement to
extensions of time and/or costs.
Please note that this letter is not, of itself, to be considered as an admission of any entitlement to an
extension of time and/or additional payment, nor does it constitute a waiver of any of the terms of the
Subcontract.
Yours faithfully,
