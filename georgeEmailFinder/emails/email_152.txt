It is important to note that we issued the above Rev 00 submittals as “Issued for information”
considering the scope of the attached documents is to provide reference only (comparison history of
other airports).
Following which, on 21 January 2020, during TM review meeting, you (CMA) requested that the above
documents should be submitted for approval. We then submitted the same Benchmark Documents
albeit enumerated as Rev. 1, under the following revised Document Submittals (i.e. Rev. 01), but on this
occasion were “Submitted for your approval” as expressly requested by you (refer to Table 2 below):

Benchmark Document In the event you failed to respond to each of the revised submittals listed above. You did however email us on 20 February 2020 [12:19 PM] requesting that we re-issue the exact same benchmark

documents albeit under an entirely new document submittal reference number, which in your words,
would “allow for [a] full 21 day review cycle [time]”. Accordingly, you asked us to withdraw each of the
foregoing document submittals “to avoid [AECOM] returning these as Code 4 [Rejected]”. For the
avoidance of any doubt as to what was stated, an extract of your email is reproduced in Figure 1 below:
Figure 1
While we acknowledge your statement that “this is the first review of the submittal[s]” on the basis that
the initial submittals were issued for information and the subsequent submittals issue for approval,
given that each of the documents appended thereto are effectively the same, we fail to see why they
should be re-issued under an entirely new document submittal – unconnected with the first issue. On
the basis that you have a long history of failing to respond to our submittals within the response times
stated in the Contract (per Specification Section 013300 ‘Submittal Procedures’) [which as you know
provides us with entitlement to extensions to the Time for Completion], then it would appear that by
insisting that we re-issue each document under a new submittal reference, this effectively allows you to
‘re-set the clock’, taking advantage of a much longer response time (i.e. 21 calendar days as opposed to
14 calendar days).
This we believe is unreasonable, especially considering the documents attached to our submittals
remain unchanged. It is also unreasonable at this stage of the project, for you to allow yourself a 21
calendar day turn-around period to review and approve the attached documents, especially when it has
been agreed that irrespective of what is specified in the Contract, all submittals must be reviewed and
returned within 7 days or less . However, given your propensity to delay reviewing our submittals, this is
unlikely; and the chances of further delays being caused as a result of such delay to the said submittals is
likely to increase.
That said, notwithstanding our appreciable concerns regarding your review of our benchmark
submittals, we complied with your request and withdrew the Rev. 01 document submittals listed in
Table 2 and on 25 February 2020, re-issued the AOS benchmark submittals under an entirely new set of
Rev. 00 submittals in the manner shown in Table 3. Accordingly, we wish to stress that our response to
your request has been made in the spirit of cooperation and is made without prejudice to our rights
under the Contract.

Our main concern and the purpose of this E-Notice is to draw your attention and put on record that not
only your request to resubmit the documents is unreasonable as explained above and is contrary with
the spirit of cooperation and progress of the works, but at this stage of the project, as recorded above,
will invariably delay the approval / closing of the Traceability matrix Performance Test (TMPT). Especially
given that you have 21 calendar days to approve each of the documents as opposed to 14 calendar days.
It is also worth noting that within your email received on 20 February 2020 [12:19 PM] there was further
email exchange between your representatives on 20 February 2020 [11:03 AM] (Figure 2 refers):
Figure 2
Essentially, your comment that“…These were all originally submitted for “information”, therefore were
reviewed as code 5…” is an admission and an acknowledgment on you part that the attached documents
had been accepted as submitted in 2018 for information only, hence, they have been suitably given
Status Code 5. Moreover, your request for us to submit the documents for ‘Approval’ was only raised
during the Traceability Matric (TM) closure workshop attended by us, yourselves, ADAC, DEERNS etc. on
21 January 2020 and it was followed by your e-mail request (per Figure 1 above). This demonstrates that
you had every opportunity to raise any concerns you might have had on this issue in 2018, but you failed
to do so.
Moreover, we are perturbed with your comment that the documents “need to be submitted for
approval, as we cannot close some of the contract requirements without approval of the documents.
They are related to performance test and justification of the performance hardware”. Our concern
derives from the fact that according to the wording of Specification Section 274233 (‘Local Departure
Control System’) we simply have to ‘deliver a benchmark document’; there is no express reference to us
submitting them ‘for ‘approval’. In essence the benchmark documents form part of the deliverables and
are not required to be submitted for approval. The relevant extract of Specification Section 274233 is
reproduced in Figure 3.
Figure 3
In addition, the statement made in your email shown in Figure 2 above, where you state “The
Contractor was told they need to submit again for approval […] Please ask the Contractor to withdraw
and submit under new DS numbers. Alternatively, should I return all as code 4?” [emphasis is made to
the question-mark (?)], implies that the requirement for us to resubmit the benchmark documents is
neither compulsory nor contractual, but it is subjective and based on your representatives’ opinion.
Accordingly, we draw you attention to a similar scenario, where on 8 April 2017, we submitted
Document Submittal No: DS/0401/8435 Rev. 00 covering issuance of Document Ref: MTB-0401-MSIAOS-PE-014, ‘Airport Integration Platform (AIP) Schema’ for “Information Only”. This was responded to
by you on 25 April 2017 classifying the submittal as Status Code 5 ‘Review not required’ together with a
comment that states ‘Contractor is responsible to maintain and update this document when required’.
There was no requirement then to re-submit this document for approval. Therefore this begs the
question why are we required to re-submit the exact same AOS benchmark documents summarised
above “For Approval”?
Your actions in this regard fails to take cognisance of the critical final stage the project is current at, nor
are they conducive to the spirit of cooperation when our joint focus should be on working together to
ensure we complete the Works as soon possible; rather this represents an act of prevention on your
part.
Based on the foregoing, it is evidently clear that your request for us to resubmit each of the benchmark
documents under completely new submittal documents with entirely new references is unreasonable

and at this stage of the project will delay the approval / closing of TMPT. This was entirely avoidable.
Hence we urge you to proceed at the earliest, with the approval of the benchmark documents listed in
Table 3 above, but in the meantime also approve /close-out the TMPT as soon as possible, to avoid any
further delays. Please note that any delays incurred to date or which may be incurred by us as a result of
your failure to approve / close-out the TMPT due to the abovementioned matter, shall be at your risk.
In conclusion and in keeping with the purpose and spirit of SAA8 we intend to keep you / the Employer
appraised (including by way of the Risk Mitigation Meetings) of the impact of the abovementioned
delays.
Yours faithfully,
