Dear Sir,
We acknowledge receipt of your letter referenced in (3) above regarding the subject matter.
We have observed that you failed to specifically identify the party who damaged your purported
completed works.
In light of the above, you are hereby advised to specifically identify the responsible party and submit
adequate evidence in order for us to notify such party accordingly. Therefore, in the absence of such
evidence, you are reminded to refrain from notifying us of such damages in the future.

In case you wish to pursue a claim against another Subcontractor, the onus is on you to provide correct
particulars in the form of substantiation/evidence of the damage for our assessment and to inform the
parties involved accordingly.
This is for your information and necessary action.
Yours faithfully,
