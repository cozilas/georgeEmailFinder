Subject: Concurrent Delay
Dear Sir,
We write in response to your letter reference 1. We have responded to any new points raised in your
letter (reference 1) in our response to the Employer's letter (reference 2).
The Contractor continues to rely upon its letter reference (3), which well states the Contractor's
position.
Yours faithfully,
