Dear Sir,

We thank you for your letter at reference 1) dated 15 July 2015.

At a meeting held on the 81h July 2015 the matter of the cross passages was raised. It was stated by the
Engineers Representative that in the absence of a submission from the JV the Engineer would proceed
to a fair determinat ion. It is the JV's understanding that the outcome of the discussion at the meeting
was that it would first be discussed between Mr. Samuel Mc Chesney and Mr. Carlo Germani. This
discussion was to occur as soon as respective individuals were available after return from leave.

We therefore request that an extension to the reply date stated for this matter is granted to
accommodate the discussion at the above mentioned meeting.

We thank you for your cooperation.
Yours faithfully
