Subject: Insufficient quality resources
Dear Sir,
We write to raise our concerns with reference to the reduction in the contractor’s dedicated quality
resources. We understand that the contractor has recently demobilized the majority of the quality
assurance and control team and consequently the quality department is unavailable to attend to quality
concerns, meeting, site walks, audits and inspections and tests.
The contractor does not currently have adequate resources to fulfill the requirement for quality
management. We remind the contractor of its duty to implement a project quality management system
to ensure compliance with specified contract requirements in accordance with section 014300 quality
assurance and 014400 quality control testing.

It is of particular concern that the works are not being checked, reviewed and verified by the
contractor’s quality control team to demonstrate and document compliance with the contract. As per
enclosed documents the contractor is submitting work inspection notifications (WIR) through zutec
without the necessary verification by the contractor’s quality control.
We also observed that wir revisions and snagging closure requests are being raised by the contractor
without first rectifying the works on site. Due to your lack of quality resources, our inspectors are
conducting inspections directly with the subcontractors. We also observed that the quality control
documentation in zutec is being filled / processed by unauthorized people such as the contractor’s
secretaries and document controllers.
The reduction in the contractor’s quality team at this critical stage of the project is of great concern and
is not acceptable given the current delays to the project and will cause further detrimental impacts to
the quality of the works. This is a breach of the contractor’s obligations under the contract and in
particular of clause 14.8 of the conditions of contract and clause 1.4 of section 013103 of the
specifications.
We request the contractor to implement immediate measures to provide all necessary quality
management and control resources required to fulfil its duties under the contract. We also request that
the contractor provides its updated organization chart showing the project quality control team
responsible for managing, performing and verifying the works.
Yours faithfully
