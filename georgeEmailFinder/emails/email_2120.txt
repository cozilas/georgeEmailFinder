Volume 6, Employer's Requirements - Section 13, Item 13.3.3.12 Elevators, Escalators and Autowalks a) Design Philosophy (iii).

where people need to walk long distances. Autowalks shall be provided for pedestrian bridges exceeding
40m length and that lead to station's remote entrances.

Autowalks shall be provided for the horizontal movement of passengers in the pedestrian tunnels,
where people need to walk long distances. Autowalks shall be provided for pedestrian bridges and
underpasses exceeding 100m length that lead to station's remote entrances. For bridges and
underpasses between 40m and 100m in length the Contractor shall consider the maximum walking
distance to the station, the catchment area of the station and the passenger numbers when deciding if
an autowalk is required, and if there is not a requirement for an autowalk the contractor shall make
passive provisions in the bridge/underpass structure to allow for the future installation of an autowalk.
The runoff at either end of an autowalk shall be 6m, and if two or more autowalks are used in a
structure the distance between them shall be minimum 12m .
Yours faithfully,
