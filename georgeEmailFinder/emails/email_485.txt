Subject Violation of ADDC's Regulations- LV Building Wires Joints (21 FOB's)
Dear Sir
We write with reference to the above mentioned subject and we record our concerns with regards to
the performance of your electrical works Subcontractor (M/s Anel) with respect to the on-site
installation activities and the Contractor's failure to effectively manage them which consequently is
having an adverse impact on the Project.

During the Surveillance and Verification Process on 16 January 2019 at both the Pier-2 and CSP, it was
observed that the LV wires for the following listed FOB's, were jointed; (1) EL-LP-E4-L2 .0-1, {2) EMRPE4There were splices inside the horizontal cable trunking and these were covered with tape, which is a
clear violation of the Project's specifications and ADDC's regulations Clause 7.5.16. The Engineer
investigated the aforementioned incident and found an extreme lack of due diligence from the
Contractor in supervising its Subcontractor's site based teams. The Contractor is therefore requested
to ensure the removal from the site of Mr. Bonefacio Joaquin as an initial measure and ensure that a
capable replacement will be mobilized.
We rem ind the Contractor that they are responsible for the management and the satisfactory
performance of their Subcontractors (Clause 12.10 of the Conditions of Contract). The Contractor is
further directed to immediately take steps to address all the identified deficiencies within their
electrical works and to provide the measures that shall be taken to mitigate any further elays.
We hereby reserve the Employer's rights under Clause 10.3 for any damages the Employer may incur
as a result of the Contractor's above delay and quality issues.
The Contractor is to present their action plan within 7 days.
Yours faithfully,
