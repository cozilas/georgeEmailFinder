Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to its Notice of Claim Nr 30 (the "Notice") issued under cover of reference 1.

However, with respect to subject matter of the aforementioned Notice, the following relevant issues
have now come to the Contractor's attention:

1.
The Contractor's MEP Designer, Messrs WS Atkins Overseas, has now advised the Contractor
(via the farmer's attached letter of 23 September 2015 reference M006-ATK-COM-LTR-00685) that it is
now able to hold its initial price of QAR 13 million for the design of the 3 above Stations (included within

its Subcontract) if it is instructed to proceed with same by 30 November 2015, notwithstanding the
original Subcontract latest instruction date of 31 August 2015.

2.
Following the Contractor's programming re-assessment, the longstop date for an instruction
from the Engineer to proceed with the MEP design to the said 3 stations so that no delay is incurred to
the completion of the Stations' Designs by their respective Time(s) for Completion, is 25 October 2015.

Consequently, for the above reasons, the Contractor now withdraws Notice of Claim Nr 30.

However, the Contractor still provides, via this letter, its notice in accordance with General Condition
("GC")
8.3.7 of the probable future event or circumstance which will affect the Contract Price and delay
execution of the Works if the Contractor does not receive the Engineer's instructions by 25 October
2015, pursuant to GC 13.7.1, to execute the MEP designs to the 3 above mentioned stations.
Dear Sir,

This is an instruction under Sub-Clause 13.1.1 of the General Conditions of Contract to initiate and
execute a variation. The nature and extent of the variation is provided below.
Yours faithfully,
