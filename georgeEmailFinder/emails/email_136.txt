Subject:UAE Government Announcement on 23 March 2020 Calling Upon the Public to Stay Home
Except for Absolute Necessity
Dear Sirs,
We refer to the UAE Government announcement on 23 March 2020, a copy of which we attach for your
ease of reference. While the announcement does not expressly refer to the COVID 19 pandemic, we
believe it is clear that this is reason behind it.
The first paragraph of the announcement states:
“The UAE government has called upon the public to stay home unless it is absolutely necessary to get
essential supplies, such as food and medicine, or perform essential jobs…”. [Our underlining for
emphasis]
In the context of the current pandemic, our ‘common sense’ understanding of “essential jobs” is those
encompassing health professionals, police, fire services, operators of the electricity grid, operators of
the water network, air control personnel etc. We do not see that “essential jobs” would include those of

the engineers, technicians, tradesmen and labourers who are presently constructing the MTB Project.
We respectfully request your view on this matter.
The announcement amongst other things continues by stating that
“… the Ministry of Interior and the National Emergency and Crisis and Disasters Management Authority
urged UAE citizens, residents, visitors and all those living in the nation, to comply with the instructions
and guidelines issued by competent health and security authorities, primarily limiting social contacts and
avoiding crowded places to ensure their safety and wellbeing.
… [the public are] are also advised [to] maintain social distancing …”
As you will be aware from our letter dated 8 March 2020, regrettably it is not practical for our labour
force to practice social distancing and/or to avoid crowded places.
We request you to advise us on the way forward such that we, as your Contractor, takes the necessary
measures to comply with the UAE announcement and ensure the health, safety and well-being of our
staff and labour force, your staff, and the staff of the Engineer.
Members of TCAJV Board remain available to meet with you at short notice (subject to appropriate
social distancing being observed by all) or alternatively, and preferably, to participate via
teleconference.
Yours faithfully,
