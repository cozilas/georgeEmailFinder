Dear Sir,

We refer to your letter reference 1 whereby you have requested an update on the discussions as
mentioned in letter reference 2.

Further to the discussion we hereby provide our submiss ion of the price savings associated with the
potential reduction of cross passages as per the Technical assessment stated within the clause 13.1.1
instruction received.

Included in the calculation is the cost for the redundant design and the cost for simulation analysis that
is still required, as clause 10.5.1.2.e), to ascertain that the waiver causes minimalrisks during evacuation
and meets the required health and safety standards as required in accordance with clause 13.1.2.(ii).
Please not that if the resulting risk to passengers during an emergency is found to be unacceptable these
cross passages would have to be installed at a later date.
We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.
Yours faithfully,
