•

Space proof the tunnel cross section to fit all required service

For Option C, the works related to these design only items remain unchanged compared to Option B.
Accordingly, there is no cost or time impact.

Supply and installation of first stage concrete, cable trays for MEP equipment and firefighting

For the item above, Option B is what we have allowed for in our tender and is reflected in the Accepted
Contract Amount.

For Option C, the work related to this item differs in that the volume of the first stage concrete is
significantly higher than Option B. Accordingly, the Contract Price (this item is related to the Lump Sum
Works) should be adjusted as per the enclosed calculations.

Notwithstanding the above, there will be no time impact arising from Option C compared to Option B
for the supply and installation of first stage concrete.

For Option C, the works related to the supply and installation of cable trays for MEP equipment and
firefighting pipes, which are part of the Provisional Sum Works, remain unchanged compared to Option
B. Accordingly, there is no cost or time impact arising from Option C compared to Option B.

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.
Yours faithfully,
