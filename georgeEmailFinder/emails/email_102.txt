Subject:Post SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0245
Delayed Access to CP RU 2033 – Delaying Mechanical Commissioning Activities
Dear Sirs,
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
The matters described in Annex A hereto, concern acts of prevention on the part of the Central
Processor (CP) retail holder and the Employer’s Other Contractor denying us access to Retail Unit (RU)
2033, which as a direct result, delayed us from completing our Mechanical Commissioning Activities.
Potential Impact
Delay and disruption due to the events and circumstances outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
likely to impact on the achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
Although we have now been able to obtain access to complete our commissioning activities subject to
the matters detailed in Annex A, we have nevertheless been delayed in completing our Works by the
acts of prevention on the part of the Employer/Employer’s Personnel/Consultants/Other Contractors.
Accordingly, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the delaying event described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event

In order for us, and our Mechanical Works Subcontractor (M/s PCE JV), to complete the Mechanical
Commissioning (MC) activities (i.e. predominantly the commissioning of Air Handling Units and Life
Safety Systems), we require access to the Central Processor (CP) Retail Unit (RU) 2033 area. Specifically,
there are 21 retail units located at the RU 2033 Tenanted areas, wherein MC activities are pending for
completion, and access to this area is therefore essential to enable us to complete our Works.
However, for reasons which are entirely beyond our control or responsibility, the CP retail holder
together with the Employer’s Other Contractor (Messrs /s BW Interiors / Funtastic) for the Tenant’s
works, stopped their activities on 24 March 2020, without any justification and/or clarification. This
denied us obtaining access to the CP RU 2033 and resultantly delayed us completing the
aforementioned MC activities.
In this regard, we informed you about this matter via numerous emails copies of which are attached at
Annex B hereto. In the event, our NOC was subsequently approved on or around 9 April 2020 but we
were not provided the key for a further six days, i.e. on or around 15 April 2020. This means therefore
that were denied access for some 22 calendar days, calculated from 24 March 2020 to 15 April 2020.
Any delays to completion of our commissioning activities, irrespective of discipline, especially at this
juncture of the Project, has the increasing potential to prevent us obtaining the Building Completion
Certificate (BCC), which is critical in us achieving completion of Milestone MS09B. Consequently, the
more we are prevented from completing our Works due to acts of prevention such as those outlined
above, then the more likely this will prevent us from achieving Substantial Completion (i.e. Milestone
MS09C).
Yours faithfully,
