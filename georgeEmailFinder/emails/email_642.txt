Subject: Temporary Sewer line at U03
Dear Sir,
Reference is made to the Engineer's letter (1) above regarding the grouting of temporary sewer lines
extending under the airside PQC and pavement from GH03 till U03.
Please be advised that some rectification works were required prior to proceeding with the grouting of
the
lines; these rectification works have already started. As previously conveyed to the Engineer, the
anticipated
completion for the grouting works is mid-November 2018. Should any unexpected circumstances be
encountered, the Contractor will notify the Engineer accordingly.
The Contractor trusts the above addresses the Engineer's concerns and considers this matter dosed.
Yours faithfully,
