Letter of comfort

Dear Sir,
We refer to the recent series of negotiations in which we have been jointly engaged regarding the
‘Internal Flooring Stone Works’ package on the Midfield Terminal Building Abu Dhabi International
Airport project (Subcontract Agreement reference MTB-SUB-061 dated 1 December 2014).
Further to the information received related to Claims and Variations thus far, TCA JV values your
contractual entitlement in the amount of AED 285,000,000.
We will continue with the Claims workshops to reach an amicable agreement as quickly as possible.

Yours faithfully,
