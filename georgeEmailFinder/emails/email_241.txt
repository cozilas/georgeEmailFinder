Subject Settlement Observed in Asphalt and Manholes at DAS LO.O
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to the Non Conformance Reports (NCR's) (1) and (2) regarding the above
subject. The recent settlement observed in the asphalt and manholes at DAS LO.O has raised concerns
which must be proactively addressed by the Contractor. The Engineer further draws the Contractor's
attention to the ongoing asphalting works being carried out at the same location (see enclosed photo
dated 13 December 2019), and requests that the Contractor urgently submits the required CAPA's to
close out these NCR's.
We urge the Contractor to immediately attend to the above in order to identify the root cause of this
observed settlement, and to competently safeguard against any potential future settlement.
We hereby reserve the Employer's rights under Clause 10.3 of the Cond itions of Contract for any
delays and consequential damages resulting from the Contractor's fa ilures to address these
noncompliant
works.
Yours faithfully,
