Subject Processor Swing Arm Test- Request for Information RFI/0401/15440
Dear Sir,
Reference is made to request for information (1) wherein the Contractor sought clarification on the
testing
requirements for the swing arm bearings installed by the Subcontractor J&H Emirates LLC.
Firstly, the Contractor notes that the above-referenced request for information was submitted on 26
November 2017 and responded by the Design Consultant (KPF) on 18 December 2017; however, it was
received by the Contractor on 12 March 2018, i.e. it took the Engineer almost three months to return
KPF's response. Considering that moneys are being withheld against the related non-conformance
report,
the Contractor expresses its dissatisfaction with the Engineer's unreasonable delay in forwarding the
responded request for information.
Secondly, the Contractor regrets that the response issued by KPF does not fully address the clarification
sought by the Contractor and the Subcontractor via request for information (1). Hence, the Contractor

reiterates its demand that the Engineer and/or the Design Consultant advise whether the laboratory test
can be undertaken applying a reduced load value in accordance with the design load and instead of the
static load value included in the catalogue.
In view of the delays already incurred in closing this issue, the Contractor politely requests the Engineer
responds as soon as practicably possible.
Yours faithfully,
