Re: Notification of Damages during the Installation of Aluminum
Checker Plate in pier 01., Level1.0.

Dear Sir,
We are in receipt of your letter referenced (1) above in which you have informed us about the seepage
of water/moisture on the surface of the aluminum checker plates which has resulted in its discoloration.
In your letter, you seem to allege that the damage has occurred due to our lack of action and you have

also requested us to take necessary measures to avoid this type of damages, which we refute and
inform you the following.
We put on record that your site storage is extremely poor and the conditions these materials are being
kept are not at the appropriate level and is affecting their quality. We also put on record that even
though you are well aware of the effect humidity has on these materials, during the summer months,
you had stored the materials without properly protecting them from humidity. The type of thick
coverage shown in the photos enclosed herewith, causes high moisture to the materials during the
summer time.
In view of the above, you are requested to take appropriate action as necessary to protect your works.
Moreover, you are reminded of your obligations under Subcontract Clauses 15.6.2 [Passing of risk and
title], 24.2.1 and 24.2.2 [Subcontractor’s Care of the Subcontract Works] to protect your works until
ownership transfers to the Employer upon Taking over Certificate in accordance with Subcontract Clause
18 [Contractor’s Taking Over].
We trust the aforementioned information and instruction are self-explanatory and you will carry out the
necessary actions.
Yours faithfully,
