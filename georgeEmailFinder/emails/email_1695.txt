Dear Sir,
We refer to the Engineer's Instruction no. 49 dated 26 April 2015 and we confirm that it was issued with
the purpose of communicating to the Contractor the new version of the Qatar Rail Codification Manual.

The above mentioned document contains some changes, including the change of station names,
instructed by the Engineer to be implemented accordingly.

However the Instruction become applicable from the date of issuance, and not retrospectively,
therefore no tim and cost implications should occur.

Yours faithfully,
