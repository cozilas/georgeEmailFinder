Subject: RE: Internal glazing Works Performance
Dear Sir,
At the outset, the Contractor would like to record that the update of the accelerated target Programme
to
Completion Rev 10.4 (with a data date of 1 February 2018), shows no slippages to the target Substantial
Completion dates set for the different sections.
Notwithstanding the above, the Contractor notes the content and concerns raised in Engineer's letter
(1).
The Contractor has put in place additional measures to address these concerns, which include but are
not
limited to the following:
Introduction of new suppliers to expedite manufacture and delivery of materials to Site;
The Contractor has conducted visits to suppliers to discuss ways on how to improve the
manufacturing and delivery times of the materials;
The Contractor (and it's Subcontractor) shall increase labour resources at site (as applicable) in
order to match the increased rate of delivery of materials to Site; and
Increase in the levels of plant and equipment in line with increased labour and increased rate of
delivery of materials.
Furthermore, for items that may affect testing and commissioning, and cause and effect testing, the
Contractor shall install temporary measures to enable third fix items to be installed, so that
commissioning
works in critical areas will not be affected.
The Contractor is confident that the additional measures put in place will bear positive results. The
Contractor assures all Parties that the Contractor is using all reasonable endeavours to complete the
Works by the accelerated target completion date.
Yours faithfully,
