Dear Sir,

Further to letter references 1and 2 concerning the cost and program impact for the implementation of a
Central Cooling System for the Gold Line, please find attached indicative cost data detailing an
additionalcost of circa
361.76 million QAR. Please note that this indicative cost data is not based on a design and as such is
subject to change. Please note that there would be an additionalcost saving associated with the reduced
requirement for electrical equipment used in relation to mechanical equipment no longer required at
each station, however as this is not in our scope we are not in a position to detail what this saving would
be.

The Contractor has examined the program impact for the implementation of the Centralised Cooling
System and believes there would minimal, if any, impact on the Completion Date through building the
Central Cooling Plants and not building the chiller yards at each of the Station Boxes. Please note that
this would be subject to final design and anÂ·instruction being given prior to 31 March 2015.

Without the Track Systems Contractor program the Contractor is not able to confirm the program
impact through installing the insulated chilled water pipes in the tunnels. If the Contractor was given
full, unhindered access to the tunnels then we believe that there would be minimal, if any, impact on
our program however this may impact the Track Systems Contractor and the Contractor would take no
responsibility, or accept any costs, for any delays they incur.

Yours faithfully,
