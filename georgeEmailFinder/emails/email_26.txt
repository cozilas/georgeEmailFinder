Dear Sir,

Re: Prolongation Cost

We acknowledge receipt of your letter referenced (1) above wherein you have requested the status of
your prolongation costs submissions. As discussed previously via email correspondences, we reiterate
that our determination of your prolongation costs submissions and the Extension of Subcontract Time
for Completion is subject to the Engineer’s determination. We assure you that we are pursuing an
expeditious response from the Engineer for this matter pursuant to Clause 11.4 [Determinations].
Moreover, after our review of your submissions, you are advised to resubmit your monthly prolongation
costs in the form of a Claim in line with the relevant Clauses of the Subcontract Agreement, taking into
consideration the comments described herein. In order to assist us in establishing your entitlement, you
are required to submit a Claim in line with the following:
1.
Submit a detailed Time Impact Analysis pursuant to Clause 27.2 [Time Impact Analysis] for each
delay event;
2.
Resubmit your monthly prolongation costs in line with Clauses 16.5 [Extension of Subcontract
Time for Completion] and 27.1 [Subcontractor’s Claims];
3.
Ensure the format, contents and structure of your submission are prepared and provided in an
acceptable manner in line with the requirements provided to you previously.
Failure to provide the necessary information will prejudice both the Subcontractor's entitlement and the
Contractor's ability to evaluate these Prolongations Costs to the satisfaction of all parties.
This is for your information, record, action and we look forward to receiving the required information.
Yours faithfully,
