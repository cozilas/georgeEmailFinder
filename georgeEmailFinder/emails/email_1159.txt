Re: Delay Notice- Hanging Scaffold Dismantling Works in CP area

Dear Sir,
We write in response to your letter (4) pertaining to the aforementioned subject, wherein you allegedly
stated that the reasons for your delays are “due to pending/outstanding payments” to your scaffolding
Subcontractor. Consequently, we reject any attempt by you, to hold us responsible for the said matter
and disregard your statement that the delays are due to the issuance of the pending Variation Order for
these works.
We hereby notify you that your continuous incorrect interpretations, do not act in good faith towards
your Contractual obligations. As a result of that, we hereby inform you the following:
Below is the history of events:
•
You submitted AED 21,077,734.19 cost with your letter reference (1) and you had been
informed that the submission was insufficient and constituted only a summary page for the said amount
without any clarification/detail;
•
We required the details, in order to evaluate your submission and hold a meeting to discuss;
•
You then submitted more details of your cost, via transmittal reference (2);
•
After reviewing your submission reference (2), we requested you to provide supporting
documents in several correspondences and meetings held with our Construction Manager;
•
You revised your submission to AED 14,196,730 on 16th November 2017 via email
correspondence (Attachment 3);
•
Our Construction Manager rejected this submission as it was significantly overloaded compared
to the actual status on site, and he requested again the split on a drawing to enable us to assess it ;
•
In the meantime in the absence of the pending documentation as stated above, as a gesture of
good will, we had proceeded with the release of on-account payments of AED 6,000,000.00 in three (3)
consecutive Payment Certificates Nos 34 - 36 between September to November 2017;
•
We have sent recently an email (Attachment-1) dated 13th January 2017, explaining the
requirements for the issuance of Variation Order which has never been responded.
•
Due to your continuous failure to submit the required documents, and while you were not
proceeding with the works on site as per your contractual obligations, we proceeded with our
evaluation based on our assessment and issued Variation Order (VO) No 46 for the said works, via letter
reference (5) issuing the amount of AED 10,188,489.85;
•
VO No 46 has been signed and accepted by you via your letter reference (6) above;
Moreover, you had chosen to stop the dismantling of the hanging scaffolding, specifically in critical areas
affecting the progress of follow on trades. Also it is noted that as a result of your actions described
herein and your slow progress on site and subsequently entire stoppage of works on critical areas
(Attachment 2), we were forced to work out of sequence, leaving incomplete areas behind and delaying
other trades.
We refer you once again to the below table extracted from our previous letter referenced (3) and
reiterate that our position remains unchanged.
Item

Status

CP Area – Dismantling/Modification of Hanging Scaffolding
Cloisall’s stoppage of dismantling and
modification of hanging scaffolding works is causing delays to follow-on trades and affecting progress
including but not limited to Chadwick vertical Sky light progress on the South infill and Arch 6
painting/cladding works.
To conclude, without prejudice to your rights under the Subcontract Agreement, and since Variation
Order No 46 has been signed and agreed by you as stated above via letter reference (6), we consider
this matter closed.
Notwithstanding the above, any delays, costs, losses and/or expenses and the like incurred by us and/or
Other Sub-Contractors arising as a result of your failure to complete the aforementioned activities will
be solely your responsibility including but not limited to Clauses 12.12 and 16.6.1.
This is for your records and immediate action.
Yours faithfully,
