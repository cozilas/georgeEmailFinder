Subject: RE: OTIS's ongoing lack of performance
Dear Sir,
The Contractor and its Subcontractor has noted and addressed the contents and concerns raised in
Engineer's letters (1-3).
The Contractor and Subcontractor have put in place mitigation measures to address these concerns. The
mitigation measures include but are not limited to the following:
An additional Construction Manager has joined the Subcontractor's workforce on 7 February 2018;

An additional Quality Control inspector has joined on 30 January 2018;
The Subcontractor's construction team has mobilised to the site offices;
The Subcontractor and its subcontractors have increased its daily working hours by two hours;
Three additional adjustors have joined, with three more expected to join in March 2018; and
The Contractor has also supplied its labour {22 numbers) to the Subcontractor for cleaning, logistical
and preparatory purposes. This is to ensure that the Subcontractor's technicians are utilising their
time as efficiently as possible.
The Contractor is confident that the mitigation measures put in place will bear positive results. The
Contractor assures all Parties that the Contractor is using all reasonable endeavours to complete the
Works by the accelerated target completion date.
Yours faithfully,
