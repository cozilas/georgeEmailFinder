Subject:Pending Re-Coding of Structural Shop Drawings
Dear Sir,
With reference to the above subject, and in continuation to the BIM workshop held at our site offices on
9 October 2017, wherein a representative of the Employer confirmed the recoding of the Elevator Shaft
Shop-drawings with code 1, we enclose our Subcontractor’s letter reference (1) and email
correspondence reference (2) above which are self-explanatory.
Specifically, the Subcontractor is requesting the Engineer’s kind action on re-coding, as agreed, the Shop
Drawings mentioned on the letter referenced (1) above, which has not yet occurred.

In view of the above, please be informed that the re-coding of the said shop drawings will enable the
approval of the relevant Work Inspection Requests (WIRs).
The Engineer is hereby politely requested to change the code status of the said drawings, thus enabling
the Contractor to close the related WIRs and proceed with the Works accordingly.
This is for your kind information and action.
Yours faithfully,
