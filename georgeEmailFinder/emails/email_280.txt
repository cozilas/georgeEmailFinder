Engineer’s Response to RFI/0401/16957 - Hardware Installation to Doors with Different Floor
Levels: Requests for Engineer’s Instruction/Variation Order
Dear Sir,
We refer to your letter reference (2) above, in which you responded to our letter ref. (1) refuting the
content of our E-Notice No. 103.
For the reasons set out in our previous letter ref. (1), we refute that we are in any way culpable for such
delays. We do not believe it is necessary to repeat that refutation herein on the ground it has already
been comprehensively addressed in our letter ref. (1).

We do however reiterate the requirement pursuant to SAA8 for you to issue an Engineer’s Instruction
(EI) and a Variation Order (VO) for the additional works discussed in our letter ref: (1), but note that you
failed to do so with respect to additional works and/or changes introduced to the works.
That said, in spite of our contractual rights we confirm that we have proceeded to complete the
Variation Works introduced vide the response to RFI/0401/16957, but our decision to proceed pending
issuance of an EI is without prejudice to our right to claim cost and time in this respect.
Yours faithfully,
