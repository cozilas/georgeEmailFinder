Subject Roof Site Hose Testing Requirements
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to the above correspondence (1) wherein the Contractor is requesting to
provide them with the test locations for all roof cladding types.
The Engineer reiterates its position conveyed via correspondence (2) that specification section MTC-401074101_07 Roof Cladding Package clause 5.8.1 imposes no obligation on the Engineer to provide to the
Contractor the test locations in advance of the completion of the works.
The Contractor is required to offer completed works in accordance with the Contract that are ready to
be
tested for the site hose testing, together with the information regarding the future test dates and
locations and a log indicating the status of SOR/MIR/WIR/MIR that should be presented by the
Contractor and for obtaining satisfactory approvals before the hose testing. In supporting progress the
Engineer may choose indicative locations a week in advance in order for the Contractor to be prepared,
while the exact location of the joints to be tested will be selected by the Engineer on the actual day of
the
test.
It is the Contractor's responsibility to provide completed works in accordance with the Contract, ensure
that the tests comply with the project specification and comply with MTC-401-074101_07 Roof Cladding
Package section 5, item 5.8 as well its Contractual obligations under clause 17 of the Condition of
Contract.
Yours faithfully,
