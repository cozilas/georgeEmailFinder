Notice to Correct – Failure to submit the Increased Performance Bond

Dear Sir,
We write to put on record your continuous failure to fulfil your subcontract obligation with regards to
submitting an Increased Performance Bond as stated in the Settlement Agreement of November 2018.
Please be reminded that we took a pro-active action to continue supporting you financially by releasing
50% of AED 4,000,000.00, which only full amount is supposed to be released upon submission and
acceptance of the Increased Bond.
In light of the aforesaid failure, we hereby issue this ‘Notice to Correct’ pursuant to Subcontract Clause
22.1 which states that;

•
“If the Subcontractor fails to carry out any obligation under the Subcontract, the Contractor may
by notice require the Subcontractor to make good the failure and to remedy it within a specified
reasonable period”.
You are hereby instructed to submit the Increased Performance Bond without any further delay within
seven (7) days from receipt of this letter.
This is for your utmost attention and immediate action.
Yours faithfully,
