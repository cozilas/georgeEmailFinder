Subject:Post SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0130
Missing General Arrangement Drawings for Security Cameras – Lounge Area
Request for Updated IFC Drawings and Engineer’s Instruction/Variation Order
Dear Sir
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and/or disruption to the Works and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
The matters described in Annex A concern an act of prevention on the part of you / the Employer’s
Design Consultant to provide essential setting out inform for the security camera installations.
Potential Impact
Delays and disruption due to the events and circumstances outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
likely to impact on achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within seven (7) days of receipt of this e-notice.

Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
On 19 May 2019, RFI/0401/17132 [dated 16 May 2019], requesting your assistance with resolving a
certain issue in relation to four (4) Facial Recognition (FR) Security Cameras to the Lounge Area; i.e. that
the final Architectural General Arrangement IFC Drawing on which FR Cameras L2.0-2074, L2.0-2075,
L2.0-2076 and L2.0-2077 “on which these cameras needs to be installed is missing” and that the “1st
and 2nd fix cannot be installed in the absence of these walls.” Nevertheless, we further advised that as
per your earlier advice, not only were data points not to be installed by us, but that the cameras were to
be free issued to us, and requested your confirmation of the same.
We requested a reply to RFI/0401/17132 by 28 May 2019. However, you failed to do so until 17 June
2019. Moreover, while the Employer’s Design Consultant response informed us that the FR Cameras
“are special and cannot be free issued” [the inference is that the Security Systems Subcontractor, Atlas,
would have to supply them], they failed to provide the information requested; and that is the specific
location/setting out arrangement to enable the cameras to be installed in accordance with the
Employer’s requirements. In fact, rather than provide us with the GA IFC Drawing as requested, the
Employer’s Design Consultant simply advised us that “the mounting height, angle, light conditions and
other installation details need to meet the requirements of the FR system.” This is not helpful at all and
fails to provide the setting out / general arrangement information expressly requested.
It is because of this failure that we are compelled to write to you to request that you provide us with a
complete fully designed and sufficiently detailed IFC set of Drawings detailing the Employer’s
requirements in respect of FR Cameras L2.0-2074, L2.0-2075, L2.0-2076 and L2.0-2077 to the Lounge
Area, accompanied by an Engineer’s Instruction, to enable us to complete the necessary works.
Meanwhile, the absence of this critical setting out / general arrangement information is preventing us
from completing the security camera installations, which if allowed to continue, will invariably knock on
to testing and commissioning and similarly impact upon our ability to achieve Milestone MS09B, and
may also prevent us from achieving Substantial Completion (i.e. Milestone MS09C).
We therefore urge you and the Employer’s Design Consultant to respond fully and without delay.
Yours faithfully,
