Poor Performance 15 - Lack of Progress Related to Hotel and Office

Dear Sir,
Further to our letter referenced in (4), kindly find enclosed the Engineer’s letter referenced in (5) above
which is self-explanatory. Specifically, the Engineer’s letter is regarding the lack of progress related to
the Office and Hotel facade works installation and in particular the corner panels, internal flashings,
brackets changing, fire rated panels and louvers fabrication, delivery and installation. The Engineer also
highlights the lack of material delivery from the suppliers.
We point out that the mentioned works are under your Scope and your failure to proceed accordingly is
causing serious delays. For clarity and for the purpose of interpretation, “the Contractor” in the
Engineer’s letter shall be read as “the Subcontractor”.
In light of the above, you are instructed pursuant to Clauses 11.3 [Instructions of the Contractor] and
12.10.1 [Sub-subcontractor Performance] and the provisions under Clause 16.4 [Recovery of Delays] to
immediately take action and submit a mitigation plan for the recovery of the current delays and to
complete all activities as per the committed schedule.
You are again reminded that any delays, costs, losses and/or expenses incurred by us and/or Other
Subcontractor/s arising as a result of the above delays shall be at your risk and recovered from your
account in accordance with the Subcontract clauses 10.3[Contractor’s Claims], 16.6.1 [Delay Damages]
and other relevant clauses.
This is for your utmost attention and immediate action.
Yours faithfully,
