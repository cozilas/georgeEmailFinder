Subject:SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0200
BHS – Floor Painting Directional Arrows – Level L1.0 Drive Isles
Receipt of Etihad / ADAC Ops ‘Approved’ Drawings on 8 January 2020 – Request for Issued for
Construction Drawings and Engineer’s Instruction/Variation Order
Dear Sir,
We refer to your letter ref: (1) entitled ‘Floor Markings at the BHS Areas (L1.0)’, which while on the face
of it was not issued in direct response to our E-Notice No. 0200 (ref: 2), it nevertheless touches on the
very issue subject to that notice; and you maintaining the position that “this issue was clarified … in June
2016” and as it was “known” i.e. clarified, then it is considered by you to be captured in SAA8.
For the reasons comprehensively set out in our letter ref: (2) we disagree.
Firstly, we fail to see how we “should have” submitted Shop Drawings based upon RFI responses when
the replies failed to provide setting out details, shapes, or dimensions of the directional arrows?
Secondly, it was not until receipt of the Employer’s e-mail dated 8 January 2020 [3:43 PM] that we were
finally provided with [signed] “approved drawings” of the BHS L1.0 Floor Marking Setting Out.
Thirdly, when compared with the original IFC Drawing attached to our letter dated 23 November 2014
(ref: MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/003309), shows a fundamental difference between the two Drawings. Hence
the approved drawing issued on 8 January 2020 represents an unequivocal change in design and scope.

We were therefore justified in requesting an EI / VO. To this end we have since received EI No. 797 (vide
ref: 3) from you requesting a proposal in accordance with the provisions of General Conditions of
Contract Sub-Clause 20.1.1(b) which will be submitted for your review and consideration in due course.
Yours faithfully,
