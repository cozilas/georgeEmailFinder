Dear Sirs,

Further to the Contractor's initial interim Claim Nr 034 submission issued under cover of reference 1, the
Contractor confirms, in accordance with Sub-Clause 20.1.6(b) of the General Conditions of Contract
(Volume 3), that the following updated additional costs in relation to Claim Nr 034 have been incurred
by the Contractor over the past month. Accordingly, the Contractor provides this December 2015
monthly update to Claim Nr 034.

The Contractor confirms that no additional cost information from others in relation to Claim 034 has
been received over the past month.

However,the Contractor's financing costs and overheads and profit "(OHP") upon same, has increased
since the Claim's initial interim submission on 26 November 2015 as no payment has been made to the
Contractor .

Claim 034's Financial December 2015 update is therefore as follows:

Finance costs have now been incurred over a period of 2 months since the commencement of the
Claim/Delay Event. Therefore, the total finance costs to date are:

(QAR 22,309,325.00 (design costs) + QAR 5,314,214.00 (construction value) + QAR 13,131,637.00
(prolongation costs) + QAR 4,607,325.00 (OHP @ 13% of the sum of all the preceding figures)) x 2/12
months x 4.25% pa (finance rate) = OAR 321,318.00.

OHP upon this finance cost are: QAR 321 ,318.00 x 13% (OHP rate) = QAR 41 ,771.00.

Therefore, total finance costs and OHP upon same to date are calculated as follows :

QAR 321,318.00 (finance costs to 31 December 2015) + QAR 41,771.00 (OHP upon finance costs) = QAR
363,089 .00.

This provides a December 2015 updated Financial Summary for Claim 034 as follows:

particulars, the Contractor shall be submitting further interim Claim submissions with respect to the

.1.6(b) of the General Conditions of Contract.
