Claim Determination pursuant to Sub-Clause 27.1.6 of the Sub-Contract Agreement

Dear Sir,
In response to your letter reference 1) above, we would like to confirm the following:
Pursuant to Clause 11.4 [Determination] of the Conditions of Subcontract Agreement, we write our
determination in relation to the following submissions issued to TCA JV under Clause 27
[Subcontractor’s Claims] of the Conditions of Subcontract Agreement.
To date Mosart have made multiple submissions (including extensive re-submissions) by way of both
standalone and joint 1) cost submissions and 2) extensions of Time for Completion claims. As a result,
this has led to a number of workshops, meetings and exchanged correspondence between the parties to
discuss a lot of the shortcomings with the submissions.
The following determination takes into consider Mosart’s complete submissions to date including
further evidence subsequently provided through the aforementioned meetings etc:
Claim no.1

TCA JV confirms they received Mosart’s claim submission via letter reference MMM/17/MTB/0135, on
29 June 2017, claiming AED 32,498,255 associated Costs with the 286-day extension of time to their
original Completion Date (i.e. 27 February 2016 to 08 December 2016), following the incorporation TCA
JV Rev 6 programme and HOA-1.
TCA JV have reviewed the evidence provided within the submission above and hereby confirm its

associated Costs pursuant to the Sub-Contract Agreement. The basis of this determination is due to the

and associated Costs equalling AED 27,703,264.
TCA JV have reviewed the evidence provided within the submission above and hereby determine that

Claim no.5
TCA JV confirm that they received Mosart’s claim submission via letter reference MMM/18/MTB/156
received on 02 October 2018. The claim is for the alleged disruption against site installation,

particulars. In consideration of this, TCA JV confirm they will revisit their determinations if the new
submissions adequately demonstrate Mosart’s entitlement under the Sub-Contract Agreement.
