Dear Sir,

Further to letter reference 1), the Contractor hereby submits a revised proposal for the milestone
payment schedules as detailed in Volume 2 Part 7 Clause 9.2.1 of the Commercial Proposal.

This revised proposal is based on on-going meetings and negotiations which has resulted in the final
agreed milestone splits as attached.

The revised milestone schedule also takes account of the variations for the relocation of Al Wabb station
and the inclusion of Options 1 and 5 for the addition of the station works and fit out for Al Azizyah
(Villagio) station and the deletion of the railway facility structure.

Due to the increased number of milestones the Contractor has also proposed a revision to the milestone
achievement certificates. At this time a certificate is required for each and every milestone which
requires many individual signatures. The contractor has proposed that a single certificate incorporating
all the milestones in a summary which would reduce the number of signatures required, see attached
for example that was proposed for application 13.

We trust that the information provided is adequate, if you require any further clarification please feel
free to contact us.

Yours faithfully,
