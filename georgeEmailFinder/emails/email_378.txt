Subject Digital Signature Proposal for As-Built Drawings
Cross Ref.
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to the Contractor's letters {1) and {2) above and advise that the Employer has
no objection with regard to the digital signatures being implemented subject to adherence to 'wet
signatures' on the final hard copy of the As-Built records.
The Contractor's proposal represents a deviation from the Contract Specification Section 017700 for
Close-Out and CAD Manual. Nevertheless, the Engineer trusts that the agreed procedure to add the
"wet signature" to the final As-Built drawings hard copies that will be submitted as part of the Project
Close-out documentation will still maintain the Contractor's responsibility/liability for the records
information and does not provide a relaxation to these obligations.
Yours faithfully
