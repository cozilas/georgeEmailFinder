Request for Engineer’s Instruction [RFEI/0401/0732]
HPC 01 paint system at GRC panels at DAS Bridge
Dear Sir,
The Contractor refers to the email correspondences enclosed herewith and particularly to the email
referenced (1) above, wherein you have mentioned that the paint system with a “70%:30% Diluted”
ratio + Keim filler applied at the joint + 2 additional HPC coats at the joints + 2 Full coats on top for
overall panel”, was found acceptable.
Please note that the mentioned system is a different paint system than the paint system specified in the
Contract for GRC panels at DAS Bridge. To date, the Contractor has not yet received a formal instruction
to proceed with the new system described above.
The Contractor hereby informs the Engineer that the above issue was not concluded before the Effective
Date of 4th September 2018 and is not subject to Sub-Clause 1.7.2 and 1.7.4 of the Settlement
Agreement and Amendment Number 8.
Consequently, the Engineer’s email reference (1) essentially constitutes a Variation to the Contract and
the Engineer is hereby requested to follow the procedure set down in Sub-Clause 2.29 of Settlement
Agreement and Amendment Number 8.
Yours faithfully,
