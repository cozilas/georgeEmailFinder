Subject Processor Swing Arm Test- Request for Information RFI/0401/15440
Cross Ref. (1) MTB/TCA/ AECOM/L/012640 dated 19 March 2018
Dear Sir,
We refer to your correspondence referenced as (1) above regarding Processor Swing Arm Test- Request
for Information RFI/0401/15440.
The Contractor stated that the response to RFI/0401/15440 provided by the design team did not fully
address the question raised. The response to the RFI refers the Contractor back to a response given for
RFI/0401/4616. Both RFI's raised a question regarding the testing of the Schaeffler Spherical bearings as
required by the project specification. RFI/0401/4616 raised the query regarding the bearings specified
under the main processor arches and RFI/0401/15440 raised a similar question regarding the Processor
Arrivals Fac;ade.
In RFI/0401/15440 the Contractor stated that the bearing cannot be tested as the test load is too great
for the equipment that the various testing laboratories have available. An identical question was raised
in RFI/0401/4616. This response was accepted by the Contractor without the ne·ed for additional
clarification as is now requested.
In fact, the bearing test information requested by the design team as part of the response to
RFI/0401/4616 was provided to the design team under reference MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/011910, dated
23rd November 2017. This information was accepted by the design team as sufficient to address the
comments raised in RFI/0401/4616.
It is therefore unclear how the same response to two identical questions can in one instance be
accepted by the Contractor and in another instance not.
The Contractor's proposal in RFI/0401/15440 to request for "reduced design loads" presents more delay
to the project as it is not certain the design loads are significantly less than the current test loads nor is it
certain the laboratories will have the equipment to test for these "reduced loads". The Contractor
should provide evidence from the manufacturer that the following have been carried out
for the bearing types listed in RFI/0401/15440:
• Prototype tests, to verify the adequacy of the design. These tests are generally ca rried out by the
manufacturer during the development of the bearing.
• Production tests, to ensure the use of correct materials and procedures in manufacture.
This is the same type of information the Contractor has already supplied in response to RFI/0401/4616.
In light of the above we now consider this matter closed
Yours faithfully,
