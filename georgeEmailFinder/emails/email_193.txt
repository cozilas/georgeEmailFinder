Engineer’s Late and Overdue Responses to As-Built Door Schedules for Piers and Central Processor
[issued vide 6 As-Built Submittals]
Dear Sir
Pursuant to the Sub-Clause 2.26 of Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described herein
may cause delay and disruption to the Works, and accordingly seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
The matters described in Annex A concern delays caused by your failure to respond to various As-Built
Door Schedule Submittals within the review times expressly stipulated in the Contract.
Potential Impact

Delay and disruption due to the events and circumstances outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
likely to impact on achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required:
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned immediately upon receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.

In the period between 22 December 2019 and 7 January 2020, we submitted the following 6 Nos. AsBuilt Door Schedule Submittals containing a corresponding number [6 Nos] of Door Schedule documents

Article 1.3 of Specification Section 013300 ‘Submittal Procedures’ governs the processing time by which
you are contractually obligated to respond to our submittals. On the basis that each of the As-Built Door
Schedule Submittals listed in Table 1 are shown to at Rev. 00 and Rev. 01, then these ought to have
been responded to by you 21 and 14 calendar days later. However, Table 1 shows that at the cut-off
date associated with this E-Notice (which is 03 February 2020), you exceeded, and at that point
continued to exceed the review periods expressly stipulated in the Contract. The summary included in
Table 1 shows for example, that your responses to Submittal DS/0401/14899 and DS/0401/15114 are
late and overdue by upwards of 29 and 22 calendar days respectively.
Any such delay is wholly unacceptable, particularly at this stage of the Project. In which respect we
remind you that Slide No. 5 of the Chairman Meeting & Walk dated 20 November 2019 expressly states:
‘All Parties must adapt a fast track programme approach. All reviews of contractual documents,
submittals and drawings must be reviewed and returned within 7 days or less.’
We should also add that all our rights and entitlements to recover the associated additional time and
costs resulting from the aforementioned act(s) of prevention on your part will apply irrespective of any
alleged failure on our part [which is denied], to transmit submittals to you in a timely manner.
The more you prolong the review and approval of the Door Schedule Submittals listed in Table 1, the
more likely this will impact our ability to complete the remaining Works and / or testing and
commissioning, which will in time, invariably impact our ability to achieve Substantial Completion.
Yours faithfully,
