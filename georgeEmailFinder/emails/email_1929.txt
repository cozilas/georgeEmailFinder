Dear Sir,

The Contractor is in receipt of letter reference 1) whereby the Engineer’s Assistant has rejected the
Contractor’s request to incorporate the Provisional Sum payment milestone that was proposed vide
letter reference 2) within the upcoming payment application.

In doing so, the EA has relied upon the waiver of Sub-Clause 4.2 (c) to the Contract Amendment and
Settlement Agreement (CASA). The Contractor hereby rejects the Engineer’s Assistant’s assertions and
kindly requests approval of the said provisional sum expenditure pursuant to the Provisional Sums
Protocol of Appendix 6 and Clause 13.7 of Volume 3 [Provisional Sums] of the Contract.

It should be noted that Clause 4 of the CASA [Release and Waiver of Claims] is wholly irrelevant to this
particular payment application which is clearly not the subject of any “any claim or entitlement arising
out of or in any way related to the Contract that the Contractor was aware of or should have been
aware of at the Effective Date" but that of a due payment pursuant to the aforementioned provisions of
the Contract.

The Contractor has duly complied with its obligations with the execution of the Provisional Sum works
set out in Annex 9 of Volume 2 of the Contract [General Preliminaries] promptly after being requested
to do so by the Employer and kindly requests the Engineer’s Assistant to reconsider its position and
confirm by return that it intends to comply with the relevant provisions of the Contract.

The Contractor awaits the Engineer’s Assistant confirmation in this respect in no later than seven (7)
days following receipt of this letter.

Yours faithfully,
