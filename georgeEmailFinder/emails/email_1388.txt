Dear Sir,

The Engineer's Assistant has serious concerns regarding the excessive displacements recorded at the
Mosque in the vicinity of the Souq Waqif Station, due to construction related activities.

It is noted that ground displacements up to the magnitude of 16 mm have been recorded in the vicinity
of the Mosque footprint near the east headwall of the Station which is unacceptable. More importantly,
it provides evidence that displacements have not been stabilized and it is now indicative of an increasing
trend relative to the station excavation and dewatering works.

The situation is further aggravated by the issue of excessive groundwater inflow near the east section of
the station that requires additional dewatering capac ity. This increasing groundwater discharge may
initiate further settlements in the footprint zone of the Mosque.

The Mosque, apart from being a very important religious structure, is also considered as being of great
heritage value to the State of Qatar, therefore Contractor is to ensure that potential damage to the
structure must be prevented and mitigated by all means.

In light of the above, the Contractor with their Lead Designer is required to submit on or before 22
September 2015, an assessment of instruments breaching trigger levels, a detailed action plan and
design of remedial works, duly verified by DVE, for preventing additional displacements at current level
in the Mosque area.
Yours faithfully,
