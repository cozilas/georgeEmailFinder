Subject:RE: Back Charge Notification – Damaged Ceilings – (Pier 4, GH 41 & 44, Level 2.0)
Dear Sir,
We write in response to your correspondence received above (4), whereby you state that the Ceiling
Contractor has installed their works out of sequence and as a result the back charge is not applicable to
Al Ghurair. We disagree with this assertion and refer you to the enclosed correspondence which clearly
states our intention to recover all costs associated with the abovementioned works as a result of the
failure to perform under the Subcontract.
We once again notify you of our intention to back charge the rectification/reinstatement costs incurred
and all other associated costs from your account in accordance with the Conditions of the Subcontract
Agreement, Clauses 10.3 [Contractor’s Claims] and Clause 12.12 [Other Contractors and Other
Subcontractors]. Particular reference is drawn to Clause 12.12.4, which states that the Subcontractor
shall be held liable to the Contractor or other Subcontractors for any costs, losses and/or expenses
arising from your failure to perform your obligations under the subcontract.
Furthermore, you are hereby advised to implement strict preventive actions in order to avoid such
incidents and delays in future.
We now consider this matter closed. This is for your information and record.

Yours faithfully,
