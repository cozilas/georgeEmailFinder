Subject:
SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26, E-Notice No. – E0008 – Request for Engineer’s Instruction
[RFEI/0401/0732] – HPC 01 Paint System at GRC Panels at DAS Bridge
Dear Sir,
We write in connection with the above mentioned subject and notify you pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of
the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 that this event may cause delay to the Works and
therefore we seek your swift resolution to avoid any future disruption or delay pertaining to this matter.
In the Consultant’s (KPF) email dated 20 September 2018 a solution to the paint system for the GRC
Panels at the DAS Bridge was found acceptable. However, this paint system is different from the original
paint specified in Specification Section 099600 and therefor constitutes a variation to the scope of work.
We requested the Engineer to issue an Engineer’s Instruction under our letter reference (1), however to
date the Contractor has not yet received a formal instruction to proceed with the new system.
Attached is a detailed chronology of the event which is self-explanatory and your prompt action,
guidance, decision or further instruction is required, failing which the works are likely to be delayed
and/or disrupted.
We reserve our rights under the Contract pursuant to Sub-Clause 27.1 (Contractor’s Claims) to an
extension of the Time for Completion and additional Costs arising from the above described event.
Yours faithfully,
