Subject:Consolidated Delay Analysis for events between 4 September 2018 and 1 May 2019 (TIA No. 1 –
Post SAA8)
Dear Sir
We refer to your letter ref: 4 issued in reply to our letter ref: 3, following receipt of your letter ref: 2,
responding to our Consolidated Delay Analysis (TIA No. 1 – Post SAA8) issued under letter ref: 1.
We are perturbed by your dismissive reply (ref: 4) to our detailed response to your assessment of TIA
No. 1 – Post SAA8 (ref: 3), with you alleging that “the Contractor’s response does not address the issues
raised by the Engineer regarding deficiencies related to the Contractor’s claim … and thus the Engineer’s
disapproval of the claim pursuant to Clause 27.1.6 of the Conditions of Contract remains.”
Firstly, our letter (ref: 3) provided a comprehensive response to each of your comments detailed in your
letter (ref: 4); we therefore fail to see how you could construe the content of our letter (ref: 3) “does not
address” any of the issues raised by you. Secondly, we dispute your further allegations that our claim is
in any way “deficient”. Any allegations of “deficiency” were address in our letter (ref: 3).

While we note your closing statement that if we object to your disapproval of our claim, we should
follow the process described in Sub-Clause 27.1.6 of the Conditions of Contract, we remind you that
under the provisions of Sub-Clause 27.1.6, when responding to a detailed claim, and disapproving it,
then you are contractually obligated to provide “detailed comments” in support of your disapproval.
Other than the broad statements made by you which we have reproduced in the second paragraph
above, you failed to provide any detailed comments supporting your disapproval of our claim.
Accordingly, we urge you to comply with the express provisions of Sub-Clause 27.1.6, and issue us with a
comprehensive set of detailed comments justifying the disapproval of our claim. Additionally, by copy
to the Employer, we respectfully request that you also give consideration to our claim also and in
particular any necessary further particulars you may require as well as provide details on the principles
of the claim; all in accordance with the explicit requirements set out in Sub-Clause 27.1.6.
Meanwhile, for the reasons set out and analysed in TIA No. 1 – Post SAA8 (letter ref: 1) as well as further
supported by our detailed letter (ref: 3), we maintain that are entitled to the extensions to the Time for
Completion of the various Milestone Dates summarised at paragraph 4 of the Executive Summary, as
well as recorded in Table 18.6 to our TIA No. 1 – Post SAA8 issued under letter (ref: 1).
Yours faithfully,
