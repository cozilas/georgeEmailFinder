Subject: C-504- CTM010.CV0024: BHS Cable Trunking Damaged -Claim Notice
Dear Sir,
We hereby acknowledge receipt of your above referenced notice for "CTM010.CV0024: BHS Cable
Trunking Damaged".
It is not evident from the photo furnished what damage was incurred nor does the report establish as to
why the Contractor would be liable. Should the you wish this to be considered further please furnish a
detailed report providing full details of the incurred damage for assessment and evidence the Works had
been completed and accepted.
Additionally, we remind you of your obligation to corroborate your compliance with Schedule 0 Scope of
Subcontract Works sub-clause 4.2.37 "to allow for providing adequate protection to adjacent finishes,
works in progress and completed works until such a time as the follow on trade has covered same,
Maintain/adjust/replace as required/directed, Remove upon completion/ instruction. Allow to rectify
damage caused by others due to failure to comply with this requirement."
Given that the notice fails to either establish any damage or liability, we are presently unable to see any
merit to your claim.
Yours faithfully,
