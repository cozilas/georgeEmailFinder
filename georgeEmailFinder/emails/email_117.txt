Subject: Observation of subsidence in areas between gh01 and pqc pavement
Dear Sir
We have observed considerable subsidence to the finished works all around pier 1 area towards the pqc
pavement, particularly to the block paving and kerbs, lamp masts, column surrounds and underground
services entering the building. Please see enclosed visual records for the current situation.
The gatehouse itself has not moved, as the pile foundations support it, however there are signs that the
chilled water pipes seem to have slumped at the wall opening.
We believe the cause of this subsidence being the impact of flood and inundation experienced during
the heavy rainfall on 10 November 2019.
Please note that there was no wet weather plan in place from the Other Contractor (L&T) and the
rainwater was allowed to run off from the pqc apron and enter the previously excavated trench for mta
stormwater line via the channel drain, which had not been blocked at the excavation zone. This started
the process of material collapse and the settlement is continuing between gatehouses 1 and 3.

Though this has been informed to the engineer and the employer during numerous sidewalks and
meetings at the time, the issue seems to have been overlooked. We are continuing to monitor the
settlement as it seems to have reached the other side of the gse road near the building where our
services are located.
We further continue to check all underground services for movement; remove and relay paving and
make corrections to the column surrounds, whereas the other contractor (L&T) will also have to re-enter
the area to remove and replace PQC concrete panels.
This is for your information and further action in furnishing necessary guidance and instructions.
Your faithfully
Subject:Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic – Update (Further Developments)
Dear Sirs,
We refer to our previous letters ref: (1) and (2) in relation to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic and
the need for Social Distancing following the UAE Government’s Announcement on 23 March 2020.
Given the rapidity by which the virus spreads, we are compelled to notify you of concerns we have in
relation to a marked increase in the number of site operatives employed by us and our subcontractors
on the MTB Project that have reported to the project clinic with symptoms similar to that of the COVID
19 virus, and while they have been found to relate to other diagnoses; this still does not alleviate the
fact that we are in a high risk environment.
We are also aware that in one of the Labour Camps that is shared with other contractors, including TAV
(albeit none of these TAV employees are working on this Project), a site operative in fact tested positive
for the COVID 19 virus placing the TAV employees on this Project at greater risk of contracting the virus.
In our letter ref: (1) we expressed concern about the circa 8,000 labourers employed on this Project who
despite being housed in various camps in Abu Dhabi share these same camps with another circa 140,000
labourers who work on other projects throughout the UAE. Given that both our labour force and the
labour force of other projects share the same buildings and facilities within those labour camps, it is
increasingly likely that not only will a person not employed on this Project who contracts COVID-19
infect site personnel working on this project, but equally this applies vice versa; someone associated
with this Project who contracts COVID-19 could potentially spread the disease to others employed
elsewhere.
While we do not want to appear alarmist, we are obligated to advise you of the increasing likelihood
that our site labour and the MTB Project personnel in particular faces; notwithstanding the risk to the
UAE in general, especially in light of the recent increase in the numbers of ‘suspicious’ Coronavirus
(COVID-19) cases.
We reiterate that we will continue to monitor the situation and keep you updated as matters develop.
Yours faithfully,
