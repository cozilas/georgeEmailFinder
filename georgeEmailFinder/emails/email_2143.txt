Dear Sir,

We refer to your letters reference 1), 3) & 4) wher eby you have requested the Contractor to submit a
quotation for a proposal to revise the power source for the emergency lighting from batteries to an
uninterrupted power source, (UPS), to be provided by the Systems, Rolling Stock and Track works
Contractor. Subsequent to this request the Engineer's Instruction No. 77, reference item 2), was
received to initiate and execute the revision as a variation.

Instructions have been issued to the designers to initiate this revision to the Employer's Requirements
and the Contractor awaits the final approved designs which will be included in the Tenders packages for
the MEP Provisional Sum works .

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.
Yours faithfully
