Dear Sir,

It is with deep concern that the Engineers Assistant (EA) finds itself writing to ALYSJ JV once again
regarding the status of accommoda tion of ALYSJ JV Subcontractors , and the failure of ALYSJ JV to
respond to letter Ref No M006-LBE-HMS-LTR-00102 dated 8 March 2015 wherein a detailed written
response was required by 15 March 2015.

ALYSJ's failure to address these critical welfare obligations is completely unacceptable to the EA and to
the employer. What is worse is that since the writing of this letter, things have not improved and have
gotten worse, as previous rejected accommodation of Subcontractor such as Phidias and Nasser Al A
liwere subject to correspondence, in which ALYSJ JV replied stating that they had all been moved to
approved accommodation (refer to Letter Ref No M006-GDB- HMS-LTR-00007 dated 27 July 2014).

This may have been the fact at the time of the correspondence, but it is evident from the issued welfare
register that labor force of these subcontractors has been significantly increased, and ALYSJ JV taj led
jp tbejr dqties to ensure that they are housed in approved accommodation. These additional workers
are being accomodated in the rejected facilities.

Below is the current status of the proj ects welfare accommodation based of the recent issuance register
received v.'ia ,your Health and Safety qept dated 20 April 2015. There is a total known
. , ,. n mber of non compliant accomr'l1'odation'which cannot be upgraded of 12, with a total of 916
workers livjng inr;ion compliant f!c:,commodation.
Dear Sir,
Once again, the Engineers Assistant (EA) finds itself writing to ALYSJ JV regarding the status of
accommodation of ALYSJ JV Subcontractors , and the failure of ALYSJ JV to respond to letter Ref Nos.
M006-LBE-HMS-LTR-00 1.32 dated 21 April 2015 and M006-LBE-HMS-LTR-00102 dated 8
March 2015 wherein a detailed written response was required by 15 March 2015 and 28 April
2015.

ALYSJ's failure to address these critical welfare obligations is completely unacceptable to the EA and to
the employer. What is worse is that since the writing of this letter, things have not improved and have
gotten worse, as previous rejected accommodation of Subcontractor such as Phidias and Nasser Al
Aliwere subject to correspondence, in which ALYSJ JV replied stating that they had all been moved to
approved accommodation (refer to Letter Ref No M006-GDB-HMS-L TR-00007 dated 27 July 2014).

This may have been the fact at the time of the correspondence, but it is evident from the issued welfare
register that labor force of these subcontractors has been significantly increased, and ALYSJ JV have
failed in their duties to ensure that they are housed in approved accommodation. These additional
workers are being accommodated in the rejected facilities.
Below is the current status of the projects welfare accommodat ion based of the recent issuance register
received
via
your
Health
and
Safety
Dept
dated
09
July 2015. There is a total known number of non-compliant accommodation which cannot be upgraded
of 13, with a total of 728 workers living in non-compliant accommodation.

There are also seventeen (17) Subcontractors whose accommodation has not yet been approved with a
total of 2248 workers accommodated in non-approved accommodation that requires necessary works
and or medical provisions. These all remain outstanding since as early as May 2014, and are urgently
required to obtain the Engineer's Assistant's approval.

2248

The lack of responses and duty of care by ALYSJ JV is now putting the approval process of SARS in
jeopardy, as Subcontractors either cannot meet Decision 18 of 2014, and certainly cannot meet Migrant
Workers Welfare Standard of 2013; therefore EA shall request ALYSJ JV to declare where they will
accommodate such Subcontractors if awarded.

An urgent response is required by ALYSJ JV within 7 days of receipt of this letter detailing their strategy
for compliance to their contractual obligations in respect to welfare.
