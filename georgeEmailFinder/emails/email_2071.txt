Dear Sir,

The Engineer's Assistant refers to letter reference 2), where the Contractor was requested to support
the consultation and negotiation process under the prov1s1ons of Clause 13 'Variations and
Adjustments' through providing a submission consistent with the method of valuation set out in Volume
3, Sub-Clause 13.6.2 'Valuation of Variations'

The Contractor has failed to respond, where the Engineer will now proceed to complete the assessment
of this Var ation, under the provisions of Sub-Clause 13.6 'Valuation of Variations', without the
requested input from the Contractor.

Yours faithfully,
