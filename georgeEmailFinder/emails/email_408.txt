Subject: Pipework and infrastructure subsidence: delayed instructions
Dear Sirs,
We refer inter alia to the above letter and whilst acknowledging the recent issuance by you of a series
of instructions in your letter 10728 dated 28 May 2019, we remain most concerned that we as yet we
still only have instructions for remedial work to Pier 4.
Given that you have been investigating this matter for over eight months and have caused the
expenditure of over AED 30m to date in iterative testing and investigating, we cannot understand why
the root cause of the subsidence has not been made clear and why we are as yet unable to plan and
properly procure works to the remaining 84% of the perimeter.
Your consultant has recently requested a scattering of more CPT that will be available in the next week:
however, this should not be holding back the issuing of IFC documentation in respect of large areas for
which full data has been with you for some time.
Please focus efforts on releasing coordinated IFC information in order that we may progress these
significantly delayed remedial Works.
Yours faithfully,
