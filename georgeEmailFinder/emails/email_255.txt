It is evidently clear that both you and the Employer’s Design Consultant (KPF) have a long established
history of continually delaying the review of our Shop Drawing Submittals, and are failing to respond to
our Shop Drawing Submittals within the review periods expressly specified in the Contract (Article 1.3 of
Specification Section 013300 ‘Submittal Procedures’ refers). Unfortunately the late and overdue
responses delays to our Shop Drawing Submittals are continuing. This is despite slide No. 5 of the
Chairman Meeting & Walk dated 20 November 2019 stating that all parties must adopt a fast track
programme approach and that drawings must be reviewed and returned within 7 days or less.

At the Risk Committee Meeting held on Sunday 15 December 2019, it was ‘accepted’ that over 650
drawings needed for Civil Defence approvals are still with KPF. It was further discussed and agreed that
appropriate action would be taken by ADAC and the Engineer to have these drawings approved without
further delay. We therefore implore you to take appropriate action to ensure this happens.
We wish to remind you that all our rights and entitlements to recover the associated additional time and
costs resulting from the aforementioned act(s) of prevention on your part will apply irrespective of any
alleged failure on our part [which is denied], to transmit submittals to you in a timely manner.
Yours faithfully,
