Clause 27.1.1: Notices of Claims – Delay Notices
Response to Engineer’s letters received in the period 1st to 30th September 2018

Dear Sir,
The Contractor refers to the Engineer’s letters received in the period 1st to 30th September 2018 listed
in Annex A hereto, replying to the Contractor’s “Notices of Claims – Delay Notices” noted therein, and
considering that the content of the Engineer’s letters are for the most part ‘generic’, responds as
follows:
The Contractor has written to the Engineer variously over the years, including without limitation its
letters ref: (2) and ref: (3), explaining why, owing to the myriad of extensive and often complex
Employer caused delay events, not to mention the frequency by which delaying events have occurred
and continue to occur, the Contractor has been prevented from strictly adhering to the requirements of
Conditions of Contract (CC) Clauses 27.1.5 and 27.2 associated with the submission of fully detailed
claims and stand-alone Time Impact Analyses (TIA). This issue has continued unabated. Indeed, by way
of example, in the 27 month period from the date of the HOA, i.e. 5 March 2015 to the date of the
Contractor’s letter ref: (3), which is 5 June 2017, the Contractor raised 344 notices of claim (averaging
12.7 notices per month), while in the past 12 months since letter ref: (3) was issued to the end of June
2018, the Contractor has raised a further 283 notices (averaging 23.6 per month); hence delaying events
have increased not decreased.
Therefore given that the Employer continues, via the Engineer, to instruct change and/or the
Contractor’s Works continues to be delayed as a result of multiple delay events, then the principal

thrust of letter ref: (3), in terms of the Contractor comprehensively setting out and explaining why it has
been prevented from meeting the deadlines outlined in CC Clauses 27.1.5 and 27.2, remains as relevant
now as it did then.
That said, the Contractor remains committed to advising the Engineer of the accumulated effects of
delay of those notified events that are demonstrated to have impacted the critical path as part of the
on-going consolidated TIA process. This will also address the mitigation measures adopted by the
Contractor pursuant to CC Clause 16.5.3, as requested to do so in the Engineer’s letters listed in Annex
A.
Accordingly, the consolidated TIA process will continue to support the Contractor’s further entitlement
to extensions to the Time for Completion in the same manner as it did for the Heads of Agreement
(HOA).
The Contractor trusts that the Engineer understands the Contractor’s position on the matters addressed
herein.
Yours faithfully,
