Dear Sir,
The Client refers to the ongoing process of interfacing with Third Parties and Stakeholders. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Consultant is hereby directed to ensure the timely incorporation of Interface
Closure Forms (ICFs) and Interface Closure Documents (ICDs) requirements in the design.

In this respect, upon receipt of any ICF and/or ICD duly signed off by the Client and the relevant
Interface Party, the Consultant shall:

a)
either incorporate such requirements_ into the design (to the extent that such requirements are
received timely or at a stage where incorporation thereof will not have a time and/or cost impact);

b)
or immediately notify the Client that the incorporation of such requirements constitutes a
variation (to the extent that such requirements are received late and the incorporation thereof will have
a time and/or cost impact or that such requirements are not in compliance with the Employer's
Requirements) . In this case, the Consultant shall request the Client to issue a formal written instruction
to carry out the Additional Services.

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.
Yours faithfully,
