Dear Sir,

Qatar Rail confirms that a presentation was made to Ashghal at the Coordination Meeting Number 99
held at Qatar Rail on 26 May 2015.

This presentation demonstrated that Qatar Rail and their Contractor have reviewed the design of the
pop up shown under the agreed stabling scheme within the Ashghal land, and it showed that the pop up
has no effect on the sightlines of the vehicles that will use the access road in that vicinity. This review
has been recorded in the minutes of that meeting.

Yours faithfully,
