Subject:Post SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0173
Damage to Carpets to Room 221 at Pier 2 Level 1.0 caused by the Employer’s Contractor (Al Hussain) Request for Engineer’s Instruction / Variation Order
Dear Sirs,
We refer to your letter ref: (1) responding to our E-Notice No. 0173 (letter ref: 2) in which you state
amongst other things that you do not consider that “the submitted E-Notice has any merit”.
While acknowledging your statement that the Employer’s Other Contractor (Abu Hussain Contracting
Company LLC) shall be responsible for the rectification / repair of the damaged carpets in Room 221 at
Pier 2, and that [other than completion of the remaining base build works], we will not be held
responsible, please note that any entitlement to an extension to the Time for Completion will not be
negated by this acknowledgement and the works of Others. Accordingly, contrary to your opinion, the
submitted E-Notice and the events recorded therein, does have ‘merit’; particularly if the repair works
delays our remaining Works us even further, in which case, our entitlement remains intact.
Therefore, for the reasons set out in our letter (ref: 2), we maintain our positon as stated therein; and
maintain all our rights under the provisions of Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1
[which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to the Time for Completion and
any associated costs arising from the events described in letter ref: (2) and the acts of Others.
Yours faithfully,
