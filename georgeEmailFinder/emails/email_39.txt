Dear Javier,
Further to our earlier discussion, we are urgently seeking your assistance to request for the release of
our payments as shown in the Table below.
Specifically, the 3 Interim Payment Applications (IPAs) shown in the Table below, for the DAF Building
have been submitted by ADMC but the respective Interim Payment Certificates have not been received
yet, nor any payment has been received yet.
Kindly note that that this is affecting our productivity, for both labor and material, and since we are in
the process of increasing our manpower and productivity, we request your support to do so.
For that reason, we kindly request the payments for the IPAs listed below, to be released as soon as
possible.

In addition, kindly note that for Building 49 - Waste Water, we have not yet received any Letter of Award
(LOA), but we nevertheless have started and are progressing with the execution of the works.
Consequently, since no LOA has been issued, we are unable to apply for any payment. Therefore, we
kindly request the issuance of an LOA at the earliest, to allow us to apply for the payment of the works
executed to date.
We highly appreciate your support regarding this matter.
Yours faithfully,
