Subject: Advance Payment Bonds; Request return for cancellation.
Dear Sir,
Subcontractor confirms that the existing Advance Payment Bonds (APB) Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4, will
expire later this month, i.e. 24 July 2018.
Contractor has proposed and Subcontractor has accepted, that in lieu of further extending the
validity of the Bonds, the advance payments will be fully recovered in the next Interim Payment
Certificate, i.e. IPC 18, May 2018.
Contractor is therefore requested to finalize IPC 18 and to return to us the original 4 Nos. APBs
including Amendments, together with a letter addressed to the First Abu Dhabi Bank confirming
that the related advance payments have been fully recovered and that the Bonds can be
cancelled.
Subcontractor has received via email a copy of Interim Payment Certificate Nos. 17, confirming
the reduced amount certified for April 2018. Subcontractor therefore encloses our updated
Statement No. 23 Revision 1 for Contractor's review and agreement.
Yours faithfully,
