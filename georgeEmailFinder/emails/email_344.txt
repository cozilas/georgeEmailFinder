Engineer’s Response to RFI/0401/16984 – Multiple Changes to 17 Doors and Door Hardware Sets to
Offices and Lounges to CP L2.1, L3.0, L3.1 and L3.2 – Request for Engineer’s Instruction (RFEI) and
Variation Order (VO)
Dear Sirs,
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
The matters described in Annex A concern delays to completion of the Works due to multiple changes to
the Door Hardware sets and other technical requirements to 17 doors introduced through workshops
and the response to RFI/0401/16984, that require a valid EI and VO for us to proceed.
Potential Impact
Delay and disruption due to the events and circumstances outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
likely to impact on achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within seven (7) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.

ANNEX A
Description of the Event
As you are aware, during the early part of this year, a series of workshops were held in order to resolve
various discrepancies in design documents issued by you relating to doors, door hardware and
associated systems. However, it was during these workshops, when discussing the Employer’s
requirements that we were informed that the technical information/requirements to numerous doors
had changed compared to previously issued information. We have already written to you on this,
including amongst others, our letter ref MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/014536, dated 8 July 2019 (ref: 1).
As part of the process of seeking your confirmation of the agreements made during these workshops,
we raised RFI/0401/16984 Rev. 00 on 27 March 2019 in the manner shown in Table 1 below, having
identified changes in functionality to 17 nos. of [outstanding] doors to the Offices and Lounges. In order
to assist you with confirming such change, we attached a comprehensive schedule listing all 17 nos. of
doors identifying the changes to each, together with a series of [revised] Hardware Sets.

9 days
Despite us requesting that you reply to RFI/0401/16984 Rev. 00 by 9 April 2019, you failed to respond
until 9 calendar days later i.e. on 18 April 2019 (see Table 1 above). Moreover, notwithstanding the fact
that 2 out of the 17 doors were deleted and the remaining 15 doors were due to be re-fabricated due to
the changes introduced during the earlier workshops, we are perturbed to note that within your
response to RFI/0401/16984 Rev. 00 you have yet again sought to introduce changes; these represent
wholescale changes that fundamentally alter the door, fire rating and door hardware sets.
Indeed, your response to RFI/0401/16984 reads as follows:
“…. The 17 doors will have an updated hardware sets as per the workshop notes based on coordination
of smoke extraction and door functionality [requirements]. Refer to the attached mark-up for additional
notes – Design coordination.”
As noted, attached to your response was a marked up version of the schedule mentioned above,
reflecting the ‘additional notes’ i.e. the further revisions required to all 17 doors (Table 2 refers):

In summary, out of 17 Doors:
•
2 Doors – Deleted
•
15 Doors – Re-fabrication/new doors required; out of which:
o
9 Doors – Changes on HW set on Door Operator per requirement of the Engineer on Smoke
extraction on Building offices 2 changes on Door Type, from DL-3 to DL-1)
o
6 Doors – Changes on HW set due to Hardware functionality into the door.
In order for us to undertake and instigate changes such as those noted above, we will require fully
coordinated revised IFC Drawings encapsulating the changes introduced in your RFI response, and
further remind you that SAA8 laid down mandatory procedures to be followed if additional works are
required, in so far as an EI and VO are needed for us to proceed with the aforementioned changes.
The provisions of Clauses 2.29 to 2.31 of SAA8 pertaining to Variations are clear; we are not to proceed
with any Variation unless a Variation Order and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. In which
respect, it is your obligation to issue this Record first if you wish to instigate change; this is only after the
additional time and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.
Therefore, until such time as you take the action required of you in accordance with SAA8 Clause 2.29,
we are unable to proceed with implementing the changes noted above and will continue to proceed in
accordance with the existing IFC design to the extent we are able to. We trust this is clear.
We once again take this opportunity in reminding you that the responsibility under the Contract for the
design of doors and the integration of those parts of the Works which are intrinsically linked to the
doors, including hardware, security access control system, power supply and the like, lies with the
Employer. Our responsibility is to follow with due diligence the Drawings and Specifications, and it is our
position that we have discharged, and continue to discharge, this obligation with the necessary
expertise, care and skill that could reasonably be expected from an experienced contractor.
Potential Impact:
We note that the foregoing events and/or circumstances may delay completion of the works and your /
Employer’s Design Consultant’s requirements to introduce fundamental changes to the doors and door
hardware sets, such as those outlined above, particularly at such a late stage of the Project, will
invariably impact on our ability to obtain the Building Completion certificate (BCC)
This is essential to achieving Milestone MS09B and may impact MS09C (Substantial Completion).
Yours faithfully,
