Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer’s Instruction Nr.126 of reference 4) issued pursuant to General Condition (“GC”)
8.8.1 of Volume 3 of the Contract, the Contractor encloses herewith full particulars of its actual design
costs in accordance with GC 8.9.1 in relation to the suspension of Al Rayyan and related Tunnel Section
works.

As a direct consequence of this instruction to suspend the works the same was duly instructed by the
Contractor to Atkins which has resulted in additional due payment for the same. The relevant Fee
Change Notices (FCN’s) along with the respective determinations are summarized as follows:

Suspension of Design Works (Al Rayyan and related Tunnel Sections)

Amount claimed by Atkins

(QAR) ALYSJ JV Determination
(QAR)
FCN115 1,753,360.00

338,697.88

FCN127 125,000.00

53,730.30

FCN134 149,324.00

56,045.57

Total (QR)

2,027,684.00

448,473.75

Table 1) FCN Amounts claimed by Atkins and ALYSJ JV Determination for the same.

As detailed herein, the Contractor estimates that QAR 448,473.75 is a fair and reasonable compensation
to Atkins against the originally claimed value of QAR 2,027,684.00 which was, at the Contractor’s
opinion, overstated both in terms of the applicable staff rates and the respective timeframes involved.

The Contractor has enclosed as attachment 1) to this letter its determination of the above FCNs.

Whilst noting that none of its aforementioned determination amounts have been agreed with Atkins as
full and sole compensation with the entire balance being the subject of an ongoing dispute, the
Contractor has nevertheless agreed to pay the amount of QAR 448,473.75 for reasons which it cannot
be held accountable.

In any event, and whilst noting that the said determination amounts may be subject to further change,
the Contractor kindly requests the Employer to proceed with an interim, on-account payment of its
current determination value plus 12% for profits and overheads, in the net amount of QAR 502,290.60.

Such payment would be of invaluable assistance to the continued financing of the Project.

Yours faithfully,
