Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence (1) and the submitted RFI wherein the Contractor provided
its suggested rectification methodology for approval.
The root cause for the settlement has not been identified to date, therefore until the Contractor
evidences that it is not culpable for these defects, the NCRs No. 850, 869, 888 and 923 shall remain open
and the Contractor remains responsible under Clause 15.5.
The Design Consultant has been tasked with reviewing the proposal and comment on the investigation
report. In order to avoid any delays to the Project delivery the Contractor is directed to immediately
proceed with rectification works including procurement, design of temporary works and/or any other
necessary work required to rectify and reinstate the works in accordance with the contract .
Yours faithfully,
