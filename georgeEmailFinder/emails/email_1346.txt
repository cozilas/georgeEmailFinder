Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer's kind extensions to the submission dates for a fully detailed claim for Claim
Numbers 2 to 10 inclusive to the 02 May 2015 (via references 1 to 5 inclusive and 7 to 10 inclusive) and,
the Contractor's notice of Claim 17 dated 15 April 2015 (concerning additional ELS at Al Waab Station)
which provides for a fully detailed claim submission by 13 May 2015, the Contractor respectfully
requests the Engineer's further agreement to an extended submission date of 20 May 2015 for the

Contractor's fully detailed and combi ned claim for all of the aforementioned stations and their
respective ELS Claims.

ALYSJ
joint venture

As previously stated, due to the nature of the ELS Claim event which concerns all of the stations, it is the
Contractor's intention to submit a combined ELS claim submission for all stations affected by the ELS
claim event thereby preventing a certain amount of repetition both in the drafting and subsequent
reading and understanding of the claim(s) but still addressing separately the claimed effects for each
station. However , due to the vast extent of the Claim event across all stations and the need to address
all the Stations virtually simultaneously, the time taken to collate all of the necessary information for a
fully detailed claim submission across all stations is proving to be extensive. It is for this reason that the
Contractor respectfully requests the Engineer's kind permission for a combined fully detailed ELS claim
submiss ion to 20 May 2015 which is actually only 7 days later than the present submission date for
Claim Number 17 (additional ELS to Al Waab).

Yours faithfully,
