Notices of Delay Notices

Dear Mr. Abbas,
KPF refer to the AECOM Transmittal as per reference 1) and the enclosed TCA-N letter under reference
2), pleas~ find enclosed NACO/DEERNS letters as per reference
3) and 4) reflecting our position.
We reject the Contractor's delay claim entirely since the Contractor received all technical information
enabling them to proceed.
We consider this topic closed as far as concerned the Design Consultants.
Yours faithfully,
