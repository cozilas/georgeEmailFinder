Subject: Overhead and Profit on Employer related Variations and Claims
Dear Sir,
We have been discussing Overheads and Profits with the Engineer and the Employer for some time as
this
was affecting close out of various Variations. In order to finalize this issue the Engineer has agreed to the
following:
1.) On Variations an amount equal to 11.11% will be added as Head Office Overhead and Profit
2.) On claims an amount equal to 5.5 % will be added for Head Office Overhead
In case you do not accept the 5.5 % Head Office Overhead you are required to provide your audited
financial reports for the last 4 years within 48 hours of receiving this letter. Please note that if the
original
reports are not in English, a translation is required. The financial reports should summarize and explain
your requested Head Office Overhead percentage and will be provided to the Engineer for review.
The 5.61% for Profit are non-negotiable.
In case you accept the above, kindly respond with your confirmation. Please note that we will consider
no
response as your confirmation of acceptance.
Please contact us immediately if you have any further questions.
Yours faithfully,
