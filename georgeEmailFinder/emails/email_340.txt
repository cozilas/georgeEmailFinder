Description of the Event
Between 4 July 2019 and 8 August 2019, we submitted 9 Mechanical Requests for Information (RFI),
seeking assistance in resolving various ambiguities in the Mechanical services design and / or the
resolution of various design coordination issues. However, we note that at the cut-off date of preparing
this E-Notice, i.e. 17 September 2019, while 6 out of the 9 RFIs had been responded to, the responses
were received significantly later that the ‘reply required by’ date (up to 55 calendar days late), while the
remaining 3 RFIs have yet to be responded to (upwards of 36 calendar days late). Details pertaining to
all 9 submittals are set out and summarised in Table 1 below.

Table 1 evidence that the 9 RFIs detailed therein relate to different aspects of the Mechanical Works to
various levels, areas and sectors of the MTB. Consequently, the outstanding responses have had and
where applicable will continue to have a delaying and disruptive effect on our progress, particularly at
this stage of the Project. This is because the late and overdue response to the noted RFIs has affected
and where applicable, will continue to affect shop drawing submittals and / or site works and/or any
other related submissions/activities affecting the overall progress of the project – not only in terms of
delay but inherent disruption due to the small isolated areas involved and the piecemeal manner in
which were are now expected to work and / or complete certain works which would not have been
necessary but for deficiencies in the design.
Therefore, the more you prolong the review and approval of our RFIs listed in Table 1, the more likely
this will impact our ability to complete the remaining Works and / or testing and commissioning, which
will in time, invariably impact our ability to achieve Substantial Completion.
Yours faithfully,
