Subject: Product Substitution for BRS Hand-Held Terminal Material
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to your letter (1), which alleges t hat you were unable to complete the testing
as a result of our fai lure to provide t he applicable battery charger for the Hand-Held Terminal (HHT)
sample on 26 September 2019.
In response, we totally disagree that we fa iled to provide the battery charger.
Our Subcontractor (SITA) confirmed that after report ing to them t hat the HHT battery was dra ined of
charge, we informed ADAC's Operation Team to return to SITA's office so that t he HHT could be
recharged. SITA charged the batteries within a few hours and returned t hem to ADAC's Operation
Team immediately afterwards.
ADAC's Operation Team subsequently carried out all relevant t esting on that day.
The sole reason why we were unable to provide the charger to ADAC's Operat ion Team on 26
September 2019 was that it was not _possible to obtain the necessary security device pass for the
charger at short notice.
In the future, should ADAC wish to carry out any fu rther testing, the devices and th e chargers are
available with SIT A and can be handed over at any time on request.
Following the tests, on your request, we subsequently submitted a further product substitution
material approval request via our lett er (2) wit hin the timeframe agreed with ADAC/CMA at progress
meetings.
Considering the above, it is evident t hat we are not culpable for any delays associated with HHT.
Delays with the approval of the HHT is clearly a consequence of acts of prevention by you and the

Employer.
Yours faithfully
