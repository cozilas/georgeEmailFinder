Subject: HOE Comments Leading to Abortive Works to already Completed Areas
Dear Sir,
The Contractor refers to the comments made by Messrs. PROFIRE during the for the MCR and Data
Center rooms; in which the Contractor was requested to include additional sampling points for the
VESDA detection system in the beam pockets of the rooms.
The Contractor notes that the works in these rooms were completed following the approved shop
drawings as listed in appendix-1 attached to this letter. Moreover, all the VESDA system installations in
these rooms were inspected earlier by Messrs. Jensen Hughes (the former HOE) and no comments
requiring any additional sampling points were raised at the time of these inspections.
The Contractor also notes that the subject rooms are already energized, and to implement the
comments of Messrs. PROFIRE at this late stage, there will be a lot of abortive works including but not
limited to, deenergizing the rooms, erecting scaffolds, removal of installed services to allow access to
the required remedial works, moreover, all ongoing cause & effect testing, commissioning and precommissioning activities will be impacted by de-energizing the rooms.
In light of the above, the Contractor requests that the Employer being the AHJ to revisit the subject
rooms to decide if the comments of Messrs. PROFIRE could be waived.
In the event the Engineer requires the Contractor to provide the additional sampling points as
commented by Messrs. PRO FIRE, the Engineer is requested to issue an Engineer's Instruction pursuant
to CC-20.1.1(a).

Yours faithfully,
