Subject:Post SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0206
Engineer’s Response to RFI/0401/17631 Rev. 0 – Additional Works (Gaskets) Introduced to
overcome a Design Deficiency (Gaps) between GRC Inclined Surfaces and ACP Opaque Bridges located at
Level 0.1 to Sectors 5.11, 5.16, 5.21, 5.26 - Request for Engineer’s Instruction (EI) / Variation Order (VO)
Dear Sirs,
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
Your response to RFI/0401/17631 detailed in Annex A hereto, represents a change in design and scope
and requires a valid EI and VO in order for us to integrate the same into the Works.
Potential Impact
Delay and disruption due to the events and circumstances outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
likely to impact on the achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within seven (7) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
On 14 October 2019 [12:15 PM] you e-mailed us (copy attached hereto), attaching a 9 page schedule
entitled ‘L10 and below Interface Tracker’, detailing a total of 100 items pertaining to the ceiling
installations to various areas of Levels L0.0 / L0.1 identified by you / ADAC during various inspections.
The ‘L10 and below Interface Tracker’ included a corresponding number of comments made by you /
ADAC in relation to previously completed ceiling works to Levels L0.0 and L0.1 and requested us to

include your comments “onto the Master tracker before publishing” so that they can be addressed by us
as part of the general snagging process being undertaken at present. Notably, items ‘78’ and ‘79’ (Figure
1 refers) made reference to exposed MEP pipes and conduits [at opaque ceilings] (which we note were
installed as per the original design / IFC Drawings) , located between the Glass Reinforced Concrete
(GRC) inclined surface and the Aluminium Composite Panels (ACP) Opaque Bridges (Figure 2 refers)
located at the Circulation Area North Level 0.1 Sectors 5.11, 5.16, 5.21 and 5.26.

Figure 2 – Exposed MEP pipes and conduits
Subsequent to receipt of the ‘L10 and below Interface Tracker’ and in particular items 78 and 79, we
raised RFI/0401/17631 on 28 November 2019, requesting further clarification in relation to your
comments about the exposed MEP pipes and conduits (as indicated in Figure 1 and Figure 2 above).
Specifically, we notified you of the existence of the exposed services passing from the GRC panels to the
Opaque Bridges, in the manner shown in Figure 3 below, as well as advised you of suggestions as to how
to resolve the matter with the use of gaskets similar to that used in other locations (Figure 4):

Appended to RFI/0401/17631 were the following attachments:
•
IFC Drawing No: MTC A 41 TB __ L0.1 _.__ 00.011 08, highlighting (in yellow) the exact locations
of the gaps between the GRC inclined surface and the ACP Opaque Bridges at Level 0.1 Sectors 5.11,
5.16, 5.21, 5.26;
•
Shop Drawings Ref Nos: 401-JH-A-02-20-5.00-CWPR-SD-303, 401-JH-A-02-20-5.00-CWPR-SD304, 401-JH-A-08-20-0.00-CWPR-SD-130, providing sections, layouts and ceiling plans, highlighting (in
yellow) the exact locations of the gaps between the GRC inclined surface and the ACP Opaque Bridges at
Level 0.1 Sectors 5.11, 5.16, 5.21, 5.26;
•
An actual photo taken on site of one of the gaps between the GRC inclined surface and the ACP
Opaque Bridge showing the exposed MEP pipes and conduits (Figure 2 refers); and
•
A photo example of Gaskets which have been installed in other locations (Figure 4 refers).
We requested a response to RFI/0401/17631 by 8 December 2019. However, you failed to reply until 11
calendar days later on 19 December 2019. Notwithstanding the prolonged period in responding, the
Employer’s Design Consultant (KFP) advised us of the following (refer to Figure 5):
Figure 5
Firstly we object to KPF’s statement that we are adopting such measure to “rectify [the Contractor’s’
defects”. This is not a Contractor defect. Moreover, we have not “deviated” from approved Shop
Drawings. Our Shop Drawings are based on IFC Drawings; and consequently the Works are based on IFC
Drawings also. This is a deficiency in the design for which the Employer’s Design Consultant is liable for,
not us. We have simply offered a potential solution to overcome the noted deficiency.
Secondly, KPF’s response (reproduced in Figure 5 above) has confirmed necessary changes to the Works
for the installation of gaskets to close the gaps between the GRC inclined surface and the ACP Opaque
Bridges, in order to hide the exposed MEP pipes and conduits by requesting us to:
“… use concertina gasket to close the gap between the GRC and ACP opaque bridge cladding to hide
exposed containments. Colour of gasket shall be RAL-9006 …” and requested us to provide “coordinated
shop drawings showing fixing details and all interfaces with adjacent works for review before proceeding
on site…”

However, what is particularly disconcerting is on the one hand KPF are surreptitiously introducing
change to the Works and insisting for example that the additional gaskets have to be a certain colour
and that we have to provide “coordinated shop drawings showing fixing details”, yet on the other hand,
they are expecting us to absorb the associated additional time and cost, and that the changes “shall
have no increased cost or programme impact to the client”. This work is additional and is a change.
Therefore if such works are to be undertaken, then we will incur additional time associated with the
preparation and approval of Shop Drawings, plus additional time in undertaking procuring the gaskets
and installing them on site. There is also the direct cost associated with the procurement and
installation of the additional gaskets utilising additional labour, plant and access scaffolding etc.; which
will involve return visits to previously completed work/areas. Plus there are the costs of delay.
Therefore for KPF to expect us to absorb the costs and time for all of that is totally unacceptable.
In this regard, we put on record that the approved Shop Drawings, do not indicate any gaskets to be
installed between the GRC inclined surface and the ACP Opaque Bridges located at Level 0.1 Sectors
5.11, 5.16, 5.21, 5.26; e.g. Shop Drawing ref: 401-JH-A-03-20-5.00-CWP-SD-074 (Figure 6 refers).
Figure 6 – Partial Extract from Shop Drawing No: 401-JH-A-03-20-5.00-CWP-SD-074
We also draw attention to the fact that given the design it is physically impossible to place the pipes /
conduits / containment other than were they are. As per the Employer’s Design Consultant’s design, the
pipes / conduits / containments crossing from the Internal Long Span Structure (ILSS) to the Departure
Access Structure (DAS) Bridge, can only cross by penetrating below the concrete beam as per IFC
Drawing No: MTC-S-08-TB-L2.0-5.00-50.872-V03 (Figure 7 refers). Hence it cannot be argued that this is
a coordination issue, it is a problem inherent in the design for which KPF are responsible.
Figure 7 - IFC Drawing No: MTC-S-08-TB-L2.0-5.00-50.872-V03
We cannot emphasise enough that we are not the designers for this Project, the Employer’s Design
Consultant is. Consequently, we accept no liability or responsibility for any inconsistencies in the
Design; this remains with the Employer’s Design Consultant. In this regard, we put on record that the
Works have been constructed by us based on IFC Drawings and the approved Shop Drawings.
In summary therefore, it is evidently clear that your/KPF’s response to RFI/0401/17631 instructing us “…
to use concertina gasket to close the gap between the GRC and ACP opaque bridge cladding to hide
exposed containments…” [to overcome the noted design deficiency] represents a change.
We further remind you that SAA8 laid down strict guidelines to follow if additional works are required
and this change / additional variations works will warrant a valid Engineer’s Instruction (EI) and a
Variation Order (VO) if you require us to proceed with integrating the revised scope into the Works.
Accordingly the express provisions of Clauses 2.29 to 2.31 of SAA8 are patently clear: We are not to
proceed with any Variation unless a Variation Order and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. In
which respect, it is your obligation to issue this Record first if you wish to instigate change; this is only
after the additional time and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.
Therefore, until such time as you take the action required of you in accordance with SAA8 Clause 2.29,
we are unable to proceed with implementing the changes noted above and will continue to proceed in
accordance with the existing IFC design to the extent we are able to.
Yours faithfully,
