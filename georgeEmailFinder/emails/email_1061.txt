Subject HBSS- Equipment failures 10080 XCT
Dear Sir,
Per the NCR-00897 referenced above, please provide a root cause analysis report, signed by the
manufacturer in Germany, design management, identifying the reasons for the 10080 XCT failures
It must be highlighted to you that a failure of the HBSS equipment during BHS testing by levels 4, 3, 2
and 1 commissioning will affect the Engineers decision to accept or reject the BHS system. The HBSS
system must be 99.99% available as specified under section 283310 I item 1.5 - Performance
Requirements
The Contractor must ensure the report is submitted at the earliest, and that the reworks start
immediately to avoid disrupting any BHS commissioning plans. Analysis should include as a minimum:
• What parts are failing
• What are the current failure rates
• Root causes analysis, reasons for the failure ofthese machines and parts
• Describe in detail how the manufacturer will rectify the problem
• Define a time frame, schedule when the rectification works will start and finish
• Define a monitoring period for the reworks to establish that the problem has been
eliminated
• Define how the Contractor will ensure the machine will not fail in the future operations
• Clarify where these machines been installed in existing operations Any replacement of parts and
equipment repairs made during the project execution must be recorded
into the project maintenance records for future reference- refer to letter (2} above.
Your urgency on this matter is required.
Yours faithfully,
