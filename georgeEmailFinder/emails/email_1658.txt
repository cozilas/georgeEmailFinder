Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer’s Instruction Nr.53 of reference 3) issued allegedly pursuant to General
Condition (“GC”) 3.3.1 of Volume 3 of the Contract, the Contractor encloses herewith full particulars of
its actual design costs related to the provision of additional buildings / structures for the TPS at grade
level to the Sharq Village emergency exit shafts.

As a direct consequence of this instruction to vary the works, the Contractor instructed Atkins to
perform additional work and has received a notice for additional payment by Atkins on account of the
additional design works entailed. Those can be summarized as per the following table:

FCN 062

Amount claimed by Atkins

(QAR) ALYSJ JV Determination

1,334,098.56

Table 1) FCN 45.1: Amounts claimed by Atkins, ALYSJ JV Determination for the same and payments to
date

As detailed herein, the Contractor estimates that QAR 1,334,098.56 is a fair and reasonable
compensation to Atkins against the originally claimed value of QAR 3,033,829.00 which was, at the
Contractor’s opinion, overstated both in terms of the applicable staff rates and the respective time
spent.

The Contractor has enclosed as attachments 1) and 2) to this letter respectively both its determination
of FCN 045.1 and the respective notice for additional payment as received by Atkins.

Whilst noting that none of its aforementioned determination amounts have been agreed with Atkins as
full and sole compensation with the entire balance being the subject of an ongoing dispute, the
Contractor has nevertheless paid the amount of QAR 1,334,098.56 already, for which, proof of payment
in the form of electronic payment (wire transfer) documents has been enclosed as attachment 3).

In any event, and whilst noting that the FCN 45.1 determination amount may be subject to further
change, the Contractor kindly requests the Employer to proceed with an interim, on-account payment of
its actual design costs incurred plus 12% for profits and overheads, in the net amount of QAR
1,494,190.39.

Such payment would be of invaluable assistance to the continued financing of the Project.

Yours faithfully,
