Dear Sir,

Reference is made to the Engineers Instruction M006-QRC-EMT-IST -00065 dated 13/08/2015 where
you were instructed to have the 1:1 Mock Up ready latest by the end of November 2015 .

Recent meetings between the Engineer and your JV left reasonable doubt that you are following the
above mentioned instruction.

The Engineer hereby repeats his expectation that the 1:1 Mock Up has to be finished by the end of
November this year and expects the JV to scale up its efforts to achieve the set date. Any delay and
effect of such delay to other activities of the programme shall be the sole responsibilities of the JV
Yours faithfully,
