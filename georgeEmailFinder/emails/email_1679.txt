Dear Sirs,

Further to the Contractor 's initial interim Claim Nr 040 submission issued under cover of reference 10
and the Contractor's subsequent monthly updates of same issued via references 2, 5 and 7, the
Contractor confirms within this May 2016 monthly update (in accordance with General Condition ("GC")
20.1.6(b) of Volume 3 of the Contract), that no additional information has been received by the
Contractor over the past month concerning the subject matter of Claim Nr 040.

However, to date, the Contractor has received no payment from the Employer with respect to Claim Nr
040. Accordingly , the Contractor provides this May 2016 Financial monthly update for Claim Nr 040 as
follows .

(QAR 2,991,596 .00 (Lead/Civil & MEP Designer's Direct Variation Costs - as stated within initial Claim
submission) + QAR 402,615 .00 (Architectural FOH Finishes Designer's Direct Variation Costs - as stated
within init ial Claim submission) = QAR 3,394,211.00.
QAR 3,394,211 .00 x 13% Contractor's Overheads & Profit ("OHP") = QAR 441,247.00. Finance costs to
31 May 2016 are therefore calculated as follows :

(QAR 3,394,211 .00 + QAR 441,247 .00) x 9 months (27 August 2015/start of Claim Event to 31 May
2016)/12 months x 4.25% p.a. (Finance rate) = OAR 122,255.00.

OHP upon Finance costs = OAR 122,255.00 x 13% (OHP rate) = QAR 15,893.00.

Therefore , total Finance Costs including OHP upon same = QAR 122,255.00 + QAR 15,893.00 = QAR
138,148.00.

This provides a May 2016 updated Financial Summary for Claim 040 as follows: FINANCIAL SUMMARY
