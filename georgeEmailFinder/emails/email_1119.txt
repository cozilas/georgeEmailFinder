Subject Lack of Mosart Productivity and Resources
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to Mosart's performance and we remind the Contractor that it is fully
responsible for the management of its Subcontractors. The Jack of Mosart's resources being
encountered across the MTB Building, is noticeable and is affecting the progress of the Works.
The Contractor has advised that Mosart's productivity will start to benefrt: when open areas are
provided
to them and as such Mosart have never really been able to suitably progress due to constrained access
to areas as managed by the Contractor. Currently, numerous large access areas are available across the
whole building for Mosart to progress their works and they are unable to furnish the resources required
to progress these urgent works.
It is noted that your Subcontractor to date has been unable to progress the works to an acceptable
manner nor provided the level of resources that are commensurate with the open work fronts. This in
turn resulted in delays to the installation of screed and stone work.
Please advise the actions that the Contractor is undertaking to clear any outstanding issues with the
works being described above in order to meet the project requirements. Should you continue to fail
your
deliverables with respect to these works, the Contractor shall submit its plan to backfill the
requirements
of the screed and stone package.
We further remind the Contractor of its obligations and responsibilities under Clause 12.9
Subcontracting.
Yours faithfully,
