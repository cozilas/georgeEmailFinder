Dear Sir,

The Engineer's Assistant makes reference and records that the BAGS Design Submissions Schedule is not
yet received from the Contractor.

During the MEP weekly meeting dated 14 September and referenced M006-LBE-ENG-MOM-00635 , the
Contractor agreed and committed to submit to the Engineer's Assistant his full BACS Design Submissions
Schedule for each of the Gold Line locations by 21 September 2015.

The dontractor is required to provide within one week after the receipt of this letter a complete BAGS
Desig Submission schedule for all locations, such as station, stabling and emergency exit shaft.

Yours faithfully,
