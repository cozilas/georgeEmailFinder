Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to letter reference 1) whereby the Engineer has requested a quotation for the
design and construction of future Subway Stub Connection for Joaan Station to Al Sadd Mall pedestrian
Underpass Complex. The Contractor herby encloses as Appendix A the detailed cost estimate for a sum
of QAR 51,203.67 to carry out the construction of the aforementioned works. The Contractor has not
been able to identify any additional design Costs and no information has been provided by the Lead
Designer to date. As such the Contractor believes that there will be no additional design cost associated
with this work however it reserves its rights under the Contract.

Yours faithfully,
