Subject:
SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26, E-Notice No. – E0007 – Discrepancies between Door
Schedule Rev 31, SACS, Data and Power Provisions
Dear Sir,
We write in connection with the above mentioned subject and notify you pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of
the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 that this event may cause delay to the Works and
therefore we seek your swift resolution to avoid any future disruption or delay pertaining to this matter.
The Engineer issued instructions EI 681, EI 681A and EI 681B under letter references (1), (2) and (3)
regarding the Door Schedule, Security Access Control Systems (SACS), Power and Data Outlet for Doors
in Bulletin 245.
A request for an Engineer’s Instruction (RFEI/0401/0676) was issued under letter reference (4) for
additional data points which were not instructed under Bulletin 245.2. The Engineer responded on the
20 September 2018 under letter reference (6) and we are of the opinion that this response does not
resolve the issue.
RFI reference (5) and (7) requested clarification for discrepancies between Door Schedule Rev 31 and IFC
Drawings for SACS. The Engineer’s response introduced further changes between the Door Schedule Rev
31, SACS, Power and Data Outlets. These changes constitute a variation under the Contract and require
an Engineer’s Instruction to amend Bulletin 245 and to proceed accordingly.
On the 06 November 2018 a meeting was held between the Engineer (AECOM) and the Contractor (TCA
JV) in an attempt to resolve the aforementioned discrepancies, however no conclusion was reached and
to date we have not received any further direction.
Your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction is required, failing which the works are
likely to be delayed and/or disrupted.
We reserve our rights under the Contract pursuant to Sub-Clause 27.1 (Contractor’s Claims) to an
extension of the Time for Completion and additional Costs arising from the above described event.

Yours faithfully,
