Dear Sir,
The Contractor acknowledges receipt of the Engineer' s above referenced letter (1) and affirms its
inadequacy of response vis-a-vis the Contractor' s letter (2).

The Engineer's ambiguous reference to correspondence listed in Appendix A of letter (lL fails to comply
with the Conditions of Contract, Clause 15.4.1 and therefore, the Engineer shall as requested and for the
avoidance of doubt, state unequivocally the reasons for rejection pursuant to Clause 15.4.1.
Notwithstanding the above, the Engineer may wish to consider a meeting with the Contractor to discuss
and agree a resolution for the current impasse to avoid further protracted reasoning.
Yours faithfully
