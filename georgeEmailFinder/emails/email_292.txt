Subject: RE: Notice of Delay
Dear Sir,
The Contractor acknowledges receipt of the Subcontractor's delay notice reference (1) in respect of
code3 comments made by the Engineer on the Subcontractor's shop drawing submissions. To be clear:
The Subcontractor's notice refers to Clause 9.10.4 of the Conditions of Subcontract; this clause
specifically
covers any delay triggered by a failure of the Contractor to issue a Specification, Drawing or instruction
within a specific and reasonable timeframe. Hence, the provisions of Clause 9.10.4 of the Conditions of
Subcontract do not relate to the Engineer's non-approval of the Subcontractor's shop drawings and
therefore do not apply to the alleged delay event.
Notwithstanding the above, the Contractor notes that the Subcontractor's letter reference (1) consist of
a
simple recollection of submissions which have not yet met with the Engineer's approval. In other words,
the Subcontractor's letter reference (1) does not provide sufficient level of information in relation to the
cause, effect (quantum), entitlement and substantiation of the claim.
Should the Subcontractor intend to claim compensation vis-a-vis the notified event, the Subcontractor is
reminded of his obligation to submit a fully detailed claim within twenty-eight (28} from the date of the
events which allegedly gave rise to the claim pursuant to the requirements of Clause 27.1.5.
Furthermore,
the Subcontractor is also obligated to submit a Time Impact Analysis in accordance with Clause 27.2.1
within twenty-one (21} days in order to enable the Contractor to review any entitlement the
Subcontractor may have for additional time and/or cost.
The Contractor urges therefore the Subcontractor to comply with the above stated contractual
obligations
as this will form part of the basis of the Contractor's assessment of the Subcontractor's submitted
delaying
events.
Yours faithfully,
