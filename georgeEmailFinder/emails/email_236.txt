Subject: Re:Notice of Back Charge- Ms. Cloisall's Damage Notification on Pier 3 Level 2 Zone 3
Dear Sir,
We are in receipt of M/S Cloisall letter referenced (2) above and enclosed herewith which is selfexplanatory, regarding the damage caused as per the subject matter. Further to our review on the
content of the abovementioned letter and previous correspondence related to the foregoing, we are of
the opinion that you have not provided any records regarding the damage on the Glass Fin mentioned in
your letter referenced (3) above.
You are hereby requested to submit a damage report and/or any other records to substantiate your
allegation mentioned in your letter referenced (3) above stating that the damages arose as a result of
“our site team damaging a glass panel” installed by you whilst erecting the scaffolding for the ceiling
works. As a result, it is noted that no clear evidence has been provided as proof that the damage, was
actually caused by the wrongdoing of others. Moreover, you are reminded of your obligation to submit
all evidence for any alleged damage in a timely manner.
Furthermore, your statement that reworks for the replacement of the glass fin were “carried out in a
congested area which unfortunately lead to the ceiling being damaged” does not relieve you from your
responsibility to take care of any part of the Subcontract Works.

Despite the lack of evidence provided thus far, we confirm that all information has been forwarded to
M/S Cloisall for their review. Should M/S Cloisall provide any comments, these will be forwarded to you
in due course. However, in absence of such information as stated above, such allegations cannot be
ascertained.
Furthermore, without prejudice to your rights under the Subcontract Agreement, we hereby notify you
of our intention to close this issue should you fail to provide satisfactory records to substantiate your
allegations.
To conclude, failing to provide evidence as stated above, we shall hold you responsible and back charge
all the reinstatement cost and other associated cost from your account according to the Conditions of
Subcontract Agreement Clause 10.3 (Contractor's Claims) and Clause 12.12 (Other Contractors and
Other Subcontractors) whereby you are liable for the loss and damages arising out of your action.
The above is for your information and further action.

Yours faithfully,
