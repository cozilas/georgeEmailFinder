Dear Sir,

Further to the Engineer’s Assistant letters of reference 1) and 2) the Contractor hereby notes that the
omitted under-platform Projectors contained within the ABM2 form part of the Architectural
Subcontract works which are currently in the process of tender.

The basis and purpose of the requested quotation for any cost and time implications is therefore not
understood, let alone of how the Contractor’s alleged delay in providing the said quotation for the same
is “preventing the Engineer from making an informed decision under the Sub-Clause 13.2.3.”

The Contractor assures the EA that its upcoming tender on account of the Architectural Subcontract
works shall exclude the requirement for under-platform projectors whereas any quantification of the
associated saving could only be provided if separate quotes for the omitted requirement are further
obtained.

Yours faithfully,
