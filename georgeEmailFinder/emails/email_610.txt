Re: Day Work Due to Ref: Cl/00344 Damage Notification

Dear Sir,
We are in receipt of your letter referenced (2) above in which you have submitted a daywork sheet
requesting for an additional payment for the works performed to allow the installation of metal panel
ceiling to facilitate the installation of MEP 3rd fix progression.
Please note that due to the fact that the works mentioned in your letter occurred before the Settlement
Agreement and Amendment to Subcontract (SAA) referenced (1) above, means that you were fully
aware of the circumstances or you should have been aware of the events/circumstances giving rise to

this claim. Consequently, as per Clauses 1.7.2 and 1.7.3 of the SAA, the works mentioned in your letter
referenced (2) are deemed to be included within the SAA.
We trust the above is clear and consider this matter closed.
Yours faithfully,
