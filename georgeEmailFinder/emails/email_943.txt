Subject Handed Over MEP Services (AMC Serving and Passing Through MEP Services)
Damaged I Removed by Other Contractors
Dear Sir,
Further to the above referenced letter the Engineer would like to clarify and record that the MEP
services serving and passing through the AMC area has not been handed over to the Employer and
remain the responsibility of the Contractor under its scope until a Taking Over Certificate is issued by
the Employer for the substantial completion of the works.
The Engineer has received the Contractor's damage report unofficially via email on 12 March 2018
with the understanding of an official submission. This will enable us to notify the responsible
Contractor accordingly. We confirm that the said advance damage report copy received is currently

being reviewed.
The Engineer will do the necessary to secure the coordination between the Contractor and ARCO
Interiors {Fit Out Contractor) to resolve and finalize the situation.
The Contractor is therefore requested to submit the official damage report with all associated costs.
Yours faithfully,
