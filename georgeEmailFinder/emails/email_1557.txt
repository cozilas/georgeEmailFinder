Dear Sir,

Further to the Contractor's Initial Formal Interim Claim Submission (Revision 0) issued under cover of
reference 1 of Claims for Extensions of Time, Payment for Additional I Var ied Woks and Reimbursement
of Loss and I or Additional Expense, as no Revised Costs or scheduling delay analysis information is
available at this juncture, subsequent ly nothing further can be disclosed during this February 2016
update.

As the event giving rise to this Claim has a continuing effect, the Contractor is still collating further
particulars, the Contractor shall be submitting further interim Claim subm issions related to the event
giving rise to the Removal of Air Conditioning in Tunnel Evacuation Shafts at monthly intervals pursuant
to Sub Clause 20.1.6(b) of the General Conditions of Contract.

Yours faithfully,
