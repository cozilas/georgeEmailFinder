Hotel Building PAVA Shop Drawings – Shop Drawing Submittals SDS/0401/E/0244 and SDS/0401/E/0649
– Late and Unreasonable Status Code 3 Comments
Dear Sirs,
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
The matters recorded in Annex A describe Status Code comments made on our Hotel PAVA Shop
Drawing by the Employer’s Design Consultant which not only are entirely contrary to what was
instructed within EI N. 440 (BP56) but points to work that s additional to our scope. We request that
you re-code the relevant Shop Drawings immediately, on the basis this is currently preventing us from
proceeding with As-Builts..
Potential Impact
Delay and disruption due to the events and circumstances outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
likely to impact on the achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned immediately upon receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
Introduction
It is worth noting at the outset that the origins of the event stem back as far as early to mid-2014 and
due to a succession of subsequent events, culminated in the need to raise this E-Notice No. 0256 in May
2020. On this basis, we provide the following chronology of the events and circumstances leading to our
Notice.
Background

In the period between 3 April 2014 and 12 May 2019, we submitted a series of Shop Drawing Submittals,
including without limitation, the six (6) revisions to SDS/0401/E/0244 (Rev. 0 to Rev. 5) listed in Table 1,
seeking approval of the Public Address / Voice Evacuation (PAVA) Single Line Diagrams attached thereto

Article 1.3 of Specification Section 013300 ‘Submittal Procedures’ governs the processing time by which
you are contractually obligated to respond to our Submittals. On the basis that each of the six
submittals listed in Table 1 are shown to be between Rev. 00 and Rev. 02 and higher, then they ought to
have been responded to by you 21, 14 and 7 calendar days later respectively. However, Table 1 shows
for example, that your responses to SDS/0401/E/0244 Rev. 03, Rev. 04 and Rev. 05 (submitted in after
the ‘Effective Date’ of SAA8 i.e. 4 September 2018), was overdue by periods of between 7 and 17
calendar days later than the seven calendar days turn around period expressly stipulated in Specification
Section 013300.
Meanwhile, on 25 October 2015, we received your letter dated 19 October 2015 (ref: MTC-CMA-TCA0401-LTR-04474), enclosing Engineer’s Instruction (EI) No. 440, instructing us “to execute the works
incorporated in the enclosed Briefing Pack 56, Deletion of Hotel Building Fit-out, Fixtures and Finishes.”
Attached to EI No. 440 were a total of 59 Sketch Drawings [and accompanying schedule and narrative],
which purported to collectively detail the design intent associated with Briefing Pack 56. These included
inter alia, the following drawings issued by the Employer’s Design Consultant relating to the PAVA
system.
•
YSK-1027-14 - Public Address Voice Evacuation Level L3.0 Sector 5.32
•
YSK-1027-15 - Public Address Voice Evacuation Level L3.1 Sector 5.32

YSK-1027-19 – ‘Narrative’
Of particular relevance was the following note regarding the PAVA system annotated upon YSK-1027-19
– ‘Narrative’, included as part of the BP 56 sketches, which the Contractor reproduces in Figure 1 below.
Figure 1
We responded to the receipt of EI No. 440 (Briefing Pack 56) by raising Likely Delay Notice (LDN) No.
1944 on 15 November 2015 (letter ref: MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/006120), giving advance notification
pursuant to Clause 16.3.5 of the General Conditions of Contract of the likely time and cost impacts
arising therefrom.
This was subsequently followed by our further letter issued on 8 December 2015 (letter dated 1
December 2015, ref: MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/006306) seeking further clarification in relation to a conflict
between your response to Shop Drawing Submittal No. SDS/0401/A/1636-00 and EI No. 440 (Briefing
Pack 56).
While on 9 August 2017 we wrote in connection with the ‘Continued Unavailability of Life Safety System
Design for Hotel Building’ vide letter ref: MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/011131, dated 7 August 2017, recording

the history of events following receipt of EI No. 440 (Briefing Pack 56) and advised you, inter alia, that
“proper design information has not been released to the Contractor for the execution of the Works due
to lack of clarity in fire life safety system requirement in grey boxes, specifically in the former "Hotel
Building".
You subsequently responded to our letter [MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/011131] on 7 September 2017 (by way
of letter ref: MTC-CMA-TCA-0401-LTR-08120, dated 4 September 2017), and confirmed the following:
“…the lighting, the lighting control systems, and the public address system should be designed and
installed as per BP-56 issued under Engineer's Instruction no.440.
The Employer has confirmed to the Engineer that the 'Fit-out Contractor' will commence their works
within the hotel's 'grey box' areas in advance of the MTB BCC.”
Following a succession of BP56 design development workshops, we then submitted SDS/0401/E/0244
Rev. 04 on 13 December 2018 (see item 5 of Table 1 above), having implemented the changes to the
design and scope of the Fire Life Safety systems introduced by the Employer / Employer’s Design
Consultant during the BP56 design development process. However, despite us having adhered to the
agreed signed-off BP neutral sketches, you subsequently returned SDS/0401/E/0244 Rev. 04 on 6
January 2019 classifying it Status Code 3, and furthermore, we note that our Single Line Diagram
(principally Shop Drawing Nos. 401-AN-PA-01-GE-0.00-PA-SD-019 and 401-AN-PA-01-GE-0.00-PA-SD020) had been annotated thereupon with the following comments by the Employer’s Design Consultant
(reproduced in Figure 2 below):
Figure 2
During subsequent disputed drawings meetings, we notified you that such comments were
unreasonable particularly given the fact we had rigidly adhered to the signed-off BP sketches.
Accordingly, we requested that you re-code our Shop Drawings. However, despite you agreeing to our
request and having re-coded SDS/0401/E/0244 Rev. 04 Status Code 2, which was returned on 23 April
2019, the comment remained.
We then re-submitted the same Shop Drawing Nos. 401-AN-PA-01-GE-0.00-PA-SD-019 and 401-AN-PA01-GE-0.00-PA-SD-020 under SDS/0401/E/0244 Rev. 05 on 12 May 2019 (refer to item 6 of Table 1),
having undertaken some minor revisions; however this was returned again classified Status Code 3 on 2
July 2019.
However, somewhat disconcertingly, the basis of the rejected status was exactly the same as identified
in Figure 2, which as we stated above, was entirely unreasonable given that we had followed the BP
sketches.
This E-Notice No. 0256
Nevertheless, we have continually highlighted in many forums (such as various meetings, discussions
and through e-mails) that the requested action is not in our scope and disputed the comments on the
drawings.
More recently, we advised you in an e-mail dated 26 March 2020 [3:00 PM], when discussing the ‘ADCD
drawings weekly updates- BIC status’, that the PAVA SLD comments annotated on Shop Drawing Nos.
401-AN-PA-01-GE-0.00-PA-SD-019
and
401-AN-PA-01-GE-0.00-PA-SD-020
(returned
via
SDS/0401/E/0244 Rev. 05) “is not in TCAJV scope”. However, in your subsequent e-mail issued on 1
April 2020 [5:19 PM], you have elected to ignore our statements as well as ignore the history of events
associated with this matter, and insisted that the above noted Employer’s Design Consultant’s
comments “is part of the TCA JV scope”.
Your e-mail contained a series of comments, which we presume are a combination of your / the
Employer’s Design Consultant’s comments, that purport to justify why the termination points were part
of our scope. These comments are reproduced in Table 2 below, adjacent to which we have provided

our own response explaining why we believe your / the Employer’s Design Consultant’s comments are
entirely unreasonable. For completeness we have maintained the same green highlighting aspects as
per your original e-mail
Table 2
CMA Response TCAJV Response
Regarding the PAVA SLD rejection and further to communication with Design consultant and CMA
commercial and checking the IFC and Specifications please note the following
1.
As per IFC specifications Section 013115 clause 1.5.A requirements the contractor shall provide
the Termination Points to the tenant including connection to Public Address System (refer to below
highlighted extract).
a.
The Contractor shall provide all utility services to the Tenant Spaces and to termination points as
indicated on the drawings. This shall include; Electric Power and panels, temporary lighting to provide
100 Lux or 10 FC uniformly across the space, Chilled Water supply and return, HVAC Supply and Return
Air, HV AC controls and BMS, Potable Water, Sanitary Mains, Internet Technologies (CAT 6 cable &
fiber), Security, Fire Protection Systems in place as brass uprights ( or as required by the AHJ) to meet
the prevailing codes, Fire Alarm devices and connection to the fire alarm control panel, and Public
Address system as indicated on the MTB drawings.
The failure to highlight the extract where it
says, "as indicated on the drawings" is noted.
Contractor followed BP 56 initial sketches and provided the PAVA system equipment’s as indicated on
the drawings as per the specification requirements.
Second part where Engineer highlighted also clearly says as indicated on the MTB drawings which in this
case are the BP initial sketches and Contractor followed the same.
2.
Following introduction of BP 56 under EI 440, it was the contractor obligation to develop the
30%, 60%, 90% Neutral documents then submit 100% coordinated shop drawings that becomes the
drawing to follow superseding IFC which the contractor failed to provide.
We disagree to the
briefing Pack design responsibility noted by the Engineer referring to Engineers own letter MTC-CMATCA-0401-LTR-03452
Contractor submitted the shop drawings as required after the BP 56 meetings finalized/initial sketches
signed by all parties.
Engineers confirmation letter MTC-CMA-TCA-0401-LTR-08120 received for the missing information
regarding life safety systems and BCC process.
3.
BP56 Narrative issued under drawing YSK-1027-19 requires a network availability/connectivity
so as and when a PAVA is implemented there will be a secure network available to run the PAVA over.
BP56 Narrative YSK-1027-19 has no information as mentioned by the Engineer. Only information
provided for PAVA is that Contractor to provide loudspeaker notification ONLY in landlord areas as
indicated.
4.
As advised by CMA commercial, there was no cost deduction requested by the contractor for
the LIMs/DOMs/network components as part of EI 440. SAA8 closed all claims a lump sum. Moreover,
IFC documents do not show LIMs/DOMs/network components as separate BOQ items
We also record that the Shop Drawings submitted under SDS/0401/E/0649 Rev. 05 on 3 March 2020 (i.e.
Shop Drawing Nos. 401-AN-PA-01-GE-0.00-PA-SD-023 and 401-AN-PA-01-GE-0.00-PA-SD-024), returned
Status Code 3 on 5 April 2020 (refer to Table 3), also contained similar comments from the Employer’s
Design Consultant as those cited in Figure 2, i.e. “IFC Circuit identification and content required including
all circuits to demise of JV scope ended in LIMs for onward connection to speakers etc by third party”.

The information shown in Table 3, serves to demonstrate that you failed to reply to SDS/0401/E/0649
Rev. 05 within the seven (7) calendar day turn-around period expressly stipulated in Specification
Section 013300, and instead of replying by 10 March 2020, you responded 25 calendar days later, on 5
April 2020.
The fact that the Employer’s Design Consultant’s comments on Shop Drawing Nos. 401-AN-PA-01-GE0.00-PA-SD-023 and 401-AN-PA-01-GE-0.00-PA-SD-024 [issued vide SDS/0401/E/0649 Rev. 05] were
similar to the comments annotated on Shop Drawing Nos. 401-AN-PA-01-GE-0.00-PA-SD-019 and 401AN-PA-01-GE-0.00-PA-SD-020 under SDS/0401/E/0244 Rev. 05 [despite you agreeing that the noted
action is not in our scope], also serves to demonstrate you further ignoring the history of events
associated with this matter.
Summary
We make the following comments and observations in relation to the above:
1.
EI No. 440/BP56 directed us that the PAVA to the Hotel Building was to be “stripped back” and
we were obliged only to provide Loudspeaker notification in Landlord areas as indicated.
2.
We complied with your directives and our PAVA Shop Drawings for the Hotel Building reflected
the signed off and agreed BP56 sketches instructed following the design development process.
3.
Despite this, the Employer’s Design Consultant have annotated the aforementioned PAVA Shop
Drawings with comments directing us to “provide all utility services to the Tenant Spaces and to
termination points” and undertake “devices and connection[s] to the fire alarm control panel, and Public
Address system …” This works is out with our scope of PAVA Works to the MTB.
4.
We further note that this is despite you having previously written to us on 7 September 2017,
and advising us that the “…the lighting, the lighting control systems, and the public address system
should be designed and installed as per BP-56 issued under Engineer's Instruction no.440.”
However, these latest comment means that the Employer’s Design Consultant in conjunction with you,
have all but ignored what has occurred before and effectively places us back in a position prior to SAA8.
We remind you once again that the recent comments annotated on our Shop Drawings point to work
that is unequivocally outside of our scope of Works. Until the comments are removed, and our Shop
Drawings are re-coded Status Code 2 or above, we are prevented from proceeding with As-Built
submissions.
Meanwhile, we further record that any delay to our As-Built Drawing Submissions has a direct impact on
the submission and completion of our scope of the following:
•
As-Built LOD 500 BIM models (submission of LOD 500 BIM models for approval is directly
dependent on approving as-built drawings)
•
Asset tagging of equipment and devices (Asset tags are defined on the as-built drawings
submitted for approval. Once approved, the asset tags can be printed and installed on site. Any delay in
approving as-built drawings may result in re-scaffolding areas to install the tags)
•
Completion of GIS (Geographic Information System) requirements (approved as-builts are an
essential pre-requisite for commencing preparation of the GIS requirements as specified by ADAC and
ADM).
The more the As-Built Drawings are delayed, the more likely this will impact our ability to complete the
remaining Works, which will in time, invariably impact our ability to achieve Substantial Completion.

All our rights and entitlements to recover the associated additional time and costs resulting from the
aforementioned act(s) of prevention on your part and that of the Design Consultant will apply
irrespective of any alleged failure on our part [which is denied], to transmit submittals to you in a timely
manner.
Finally we note that although the genesis of this ‘delaying event’ originated prior the ‘Effective Date’
included in SAA8 (4 September 2018), for the reasons described above, this matter cannot possibly be
construed as being deemed to be included as part of ‘Contractor’s Settled Claims’ (SAA8 Sub-Clause
1.7.2) and ‘Included Circumstances’ (per SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.7.4). That said, kindly note that the effects
of delay associated with this matter will nevertheless be analysed from 4 September 2018 onwards.
Yours faithfully,
