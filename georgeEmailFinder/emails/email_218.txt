Dear Habib,
It has become noticeable these past few weeks that a ‘block’ has been placed on certain contractual
letters that prevents viewing them on Dashboard.
However, this prevents the Contracts Team from reviewing them – the very team that has either
generated the letters in the first place or are required to review / action the incoming AECOM letters.
Can I therefore ask that this ‘block’ be lifted for the person copied in on this e-mail [other than Max and
Kieran who are assumed to have unfettered access]?
Thank you in advance of your kind assistance.
Yours faithfully,
