Subject Breach of Conditions of Contract- Contractor's Claims pursuant to HOA
Dear Sir,
We write in response to the above referenced correspondence (1) with regard to the Engineer's alleged
breach of the Conditions of Contract in relation to the Contractor's Claims pursuant to the Heads of
Agreement (HOA).
We concur with t he Contractor's statement that the issue has been previously addressed by the
Engineer and that the Engineer has repeated the same position put forth in prior correspondence. The
Contractor has been requested numerous times to submit the required substantiation to support an
entitlement with regard to the claimed cost.
The Engineer refutes the assertion that for more than a year has made no effort to agree or det ermine

the amounts due. The Engineer's efforts are well documented via the numerous correspondence issued
throughout the year to the Contractor, urging for the necessary records to be submitted and the proper
substantiation to be achieved in order to enable the Engineer to determine the submitted Claims. These
are listed below for ease of reference as follows:
The Contractor shall abstain from issuing any further spurious correspondence regarding the alleged
"Breach of Contract" by the Engineer.
We note that a way forward has been agreed by the Engineer and the Contractor at the meeting held on
7 March 2017 and we look forward to receiving the Subcontractor's substa ntiation as agreed at the
meeting and confirmed via correspondence ref. MTC-CMA-TCA-0401-LTR-06945 dated 9 March 2017.
Yours faithfully,
