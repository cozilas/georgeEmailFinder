Dear Sir,

We refer to your request for a direction under letter reference 2) as well as to references 3), 4), 5), 6), 7)
and
8) with regards to ABM2 and the "5 Key Design Issues."

Please find enclosed our letter to the Engineer's Assistant under reference 1) whereby we have
submitted the DD1 Stations drawings that were duly signed by QR, PMC incorporating a) the "five key
items for DD1", b) minor related inclusions, and c) other non AMB related Qatar Rail preferential
inclusions which can be incorporated into subsequent design development.

As agreed with PMC and QR, we will progress and submit for SONO DD2a (30%) designs for all Stations
on the basis of these DD1 drawings. To this extent, we hereby confirm that you have submitted the
DD2a (30%) in line with the above for Al Sudan, Joaan, Qatar National Museum, Al Aziziyah and Al Waab.
The remaining stations designs are in progress and are expected to be submitted shortly.

We hope that the above confirmation that you are proceeding as agreed with PMC and QR covers your
request and we deem that no further direction is necessary.

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.
Yours faithfully,
