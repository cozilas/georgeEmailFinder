Re: Application for Taking Over and Release of Retention Monies

Dear Sir,
We refer to your letters referenced (1) and (2) above and our discussion regarding the subject matter
and we hereby inform you of the following:
Please be informed that pursuant to the conditions under paragraph 8 [Retention] of Schedule 11
[Payment Terms] of the Subcontract, you are not entitled to the release of the Retention amount
against a corresponding Retention Bond as stated in your letter reference (1) above.
In regards to your request as per your letter reference (2) wherein you have applied for a Taking Over
Certificate (TOC), please note that the TOC is subject to the Engineer’s issuance. Pursuant to the
Subcontract Clause 18.1.1 [Taking Over of the Subcontract Works and Milestones] “Subject to clause
18.2 (Taking Over of Parts of the Subcontract Works) a Taking Over Certificate shall only be issued on
Substantial Completion […]”. Moreover, the Subcontract Clause 18.1.8 clearly specifies that
“Notwithstanding the provisions of this clause 18.1, the Subcontractor agrees that receipt by the
Contractor of the relevant Taking Over Certificate for the relevant part of the Works from the Engineer is
a condition precedent for the issuance by Contractor of the relevant Taking Over Certificate for the
relevant part of the Subcontract Works, unless otherwise agreed”. Accordingly, please be informed that
the Engineer has not yet issued any TOC for any of the parts of the works for any of the Subcontractors
in the Project. Consequently, a response would be provided only after the Engineer provides its
Determination, issuance and/or a response to the same.
In view of the above, please be informed that the return of the Retention Bond and the release of the
retention monies are subject to the issue of TOC for Substantial Completion. Consequently, since the
TOC for Substantial Completion has not been issued by the Engineer yet, as stated above, we are unable
to proceed with the issuance of the same. Therefore, once the aforementioned is issued by the Engineer
we shall proceed with the provisions provided within the Subcontract and described herein to release
the Retention Bond and the retention amounts accordingly.

In response to your statement made in your letter referenced (2) above, regarding the expenses
associated with the renewal of Insurance Policies, Bonds and Warranties, we would suggest that you
continue submitting any costs related to your prolongation costs to ensure that all relevant evidence is
put on record for evaluation.
We trust you find the aforementioned self-explanatory and clarifies the matter.
Yours Faithfully,
