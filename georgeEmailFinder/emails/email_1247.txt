Subject: likely Delay Notice No. 1885- Engineer's Instruction No. 350F- Briefing Pack
Dear Sir,
The Contractor hereby submits this Likely Delay Notice No. 1885 in accordance with the requirements of
Clause 16.3.5 of the Conditions of Contract, in consideration that t he sketches and other information
attached to El No. 350F, as developed by the relevant Briefing Pack (namely Briefing Packs 2, 6 & 23, 13,
31, 38, 39, 40 and 45}, may adversely affect or delay the design and I or execution of the Works.
1.0 Basis of Notice
Background
1.1 On 20 September 2015 (letter dated 17 September 2015, ref: MTB/TCA/AECOM/ L/005725}, the
Contractor issued the Engineer 'Briefing Packs Signed Document Record Sheets' (principally
relating to Briefing Packs 2, 6 & 23, 13, 31, 38, 39, 40 and 45}, covering the sketches and Change
Management Information Requests (CMIRs) generated [by the Change Management Team] in th~
period between 3 September and 15 September 2015 (comprising a mix of inter alia 30%, 60% and
90% signed off Record Sheets).
1.2 The Contractor stated that attachments were issued for the "required actions in preparation of the
necessary IFC and Engineer's Instructions". The Contractor further noted that some of the signed
document dates may slightly differ from the cut-off date due to a time gap between the actual
signatures and uploading [the sketches and so forth] into the file transfer protocol server.
Nonetheless, the Contractor concluded that it was "proceeding concurrently in good faith with the
subsequent works on the basis of these sketches".
El No. 350F
1.3 Subsequent to which, on 1 October 2015, the Contractor received the Engineer's letter dated 28

September 2015 (ref: MTC-CMA-TCA-0401-LTR-04375}, attaching Engineer's Instruction (E I} No.
350F, which instructs the Contractor, pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 20.1 .1 (a), " ...
to implement the works shown on the attached drawings (CD and contents list attached}, as
developed by the relevant Briefing Packs."
1.3.1 Contrary to the Engineer's statement, the attachments to El No. 35FD consists of marked
up sketches as opposed to "drawings", and were certainly not marked up IFC Drawings.
1.4 Attached to El No. 350F was 1 CD containing the various sketches and other information recorded
in Attachment A thereto, which the Contractor summarizes in Annex A hereto.
1.5 According to El No. 350F, "this [Instruction] contains documents listed in [the Contractor's] letter
MTB/TCA/AECOM/L/005725, dated 17 September 2015". However, the Contractor notes that not
all of the documents attached to the Contractor's letter dated 17 September 2015 (ref: 005725)
were released under El No. 350F, in so far as the attachments to letter ref: 005725 consisted of
183 Nos. of sketches and documents, whilst El No. 350F only released 39 Nos. signed sketches.
Summary
1.6 At this stage it is not known whether or to what extent the sketches released under El No. 350F
correlates with the same Briefing Pack design intent information reflected within the 'MTB Bulletins 145-150 + Briefing Packs' schedule attached to the Heads of Agreement, and if (1) it is
deemed to be included and has no impact upon the Works, or (2), is in excess of and I or in
addition to the design intent, giving rise to potential additional entitlement to extensions of time.
1.7 Consequently, until such time as this is determined, the Contractor issues this Likely Delay Notice
No. 1885 on the premise this 'event' or set of circumstances has the potential to delay the design
and I or execution of the Works. Meanwhile, it is the Contractor's contention that its agreement
to "implement" Document Record Sheets for Briefing Packs 2, 6 & 23, 13, 31, 38, 39, 40 and 45
into the Works in good faith, constitutes a delay recovery measure in itself; particularly as the
applicable sketches released and instructed under El No. 350F was done do in advance of "the
necessary IFC and Engineer's lnstructions"-being issued to the Contractor by the Engineer.
2.0 Potential Impact on the Works
2.1 This Likely Delay Notice No. 1885 is issued in accordance with Clause 16.3.5 which states:
'The Contractor shall promptly give notice to the Engineer of specific probable future events or
circumstances which may adversely affect or delay the design and/or execution of the Works."
2.2 At this stage, it is not known how or to what extent the various information released under El No.
350F (recorded in Annex A) is likely to affect or delay the design and I or execution of the Works.
2.3 Nevertheless, the Contractor undertakes to assess the impact that this potential delaying event
may have on the Works against the Clause 16.3 Programme (Rev. 6.2), approved {Code 2) by the
Engineer on 9 July 2015; the outcome of which will be submitted to the Engineer in due course.
Yours faithfully,
