Dear Sir,

The Contractor’s letter of reference 1) outlined the scope of works regarding the conversion of the Gold
Line mock-up facility into a temporary exhibition center that shall be open to the public and furthermore
included a preliminary proposal by its design consultant.

Via the Contractor’s letter of reference 1) the Contractor further requested the EA’s clear direction as to
occupancy load limitations and the deployment of fire wardens subject to which wet sprinklers may be
omitted in accordance with QCDD requirements. The Contractor is currently awaiting the EA’s response
thereto.

Nevertheless the Contractor has progressed with the pricing of the works and encloses in attachment 1)
hereto its subcontractor’s proposal. The Contractor’s proposal is summarized in the table below:

Amount (QAR)
Lump sum amount proposed by subcontractor 2,158,095.00
Contractor’s Attendances, Management, OH & Profits (12%)
Total

258,971.40

2,417,066.40

This lump sum proposal is inclusive of design. It also includes up to 3 (three) site visits by the fire and life
safety design consultant during the design phase and an additional 3 (three) site visits to facilitate the
QCDD inspection.

The Contractor is now awaiting an Engineer’s Instruction under Clause 13 of Volume 3 of the Contract
before proceeding with the works in line with the timeline put forward under letter reference 1).

Yours faithfully,
