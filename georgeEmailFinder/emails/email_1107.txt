Subject: RE: Employment of International Decor Staff
Dear Sir,
The Contractor confirms receipt of letter (1) wherein the Subcontractor claim that Arabtec has
approached
one of the Subcontractor's site foreman and offered him an offer employment to work on the Project.
Please note that the Subcontractor's letter (1) does not provide the minimum level of detail (names,
dates,
etc.) that enables the Contractor to investigate the alleged wrongdoing fu rther. Notwithstanding this, it
appears to the Contractor that this situation may have been a simple misunderstanding by the
Subcontractor's site foreman.
To be clear, neither the Contractor nor the companies comprising the Joint Venture intend to employ
the
Subcontractor's personnel to undertake works on the Project.
Yours faithfully,
