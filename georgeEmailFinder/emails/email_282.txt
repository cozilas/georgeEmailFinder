Engineer's Response to RFI/0401/17385 – Introduction of Power Assistance to Hollow Metal
Doors Reference Nos. 88-T-B20-0124.01 and 88-T-B20-0124.02 – Request for Engineer’s Instruction
(RFEI) / Variation Order (VO)

Dear Sir
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and/or disruption to the Works and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
Your response to RFI/0401/17385 detailed in Annex A represents a change in the design and scope of
Works and requires a valid EI and VO in order for us to integrate the same into the Works.
Potential Impact
Any requirement for additional works, such as that outlined herein and at this stage of the Project, is
likely to impact on the achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within seven (7) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
As you are only too aware, during the early part of this year, a series of workshops were held in order to
resolve various discrepancies in design documents issued by you relating to doors, door hardware and
associated systems. However, it was during these workshops, when discussing the Employer’s
Requirements that we were informed that the technical information/requirements to 152 out of 383
nos. of doors had changed compared to previously issued information. This has given rise to a number
of letters and various Requests for Information (RFI) in which a number of changes were recorded by us.
By way of specific example, on 21 August 2019, we raised RFI/0401/17385 requesting clarification as to
whether two doors, i.e. Doors ‘88-T-B20-0124.01’ and ‘88-T-B20-0124.02’ require power assistance or
not. Clarification was required due to the fact that on the one hand the hardware sets for Doors ‘88-TB20-0124.01’ ‘88-T-B20-0124.02’ were confirmed via the response to DS/0401/10839 received on 13
January 2018 as being referenced ‘327’ (i.e. with Electric Hold Open Device’) [which means power is
required]; yet on the other hand, the requirement for a commensurate Security Access Control System
(SACS) and ‘Power Assist’ to each door was shown to be ‘N’, in other words, not required.
That said, in the event that hardware set ‘327’ is required for these two Hollow Metal Doors then they
will require a power supply for them to function and operate. However, a review of the corresponding
Electrical IFC layouts shows no incoming power supply to the doors.
It is because of this anomaly, that we were compelled to raise RFI/0401/17385 (refer to Table 1 below),
requesting your assistance with providing further clarification as to the ‘Missing Power Supply on Hollow
Metal Doors with Hold-Open Devices’ for these two (2) nos. of doors.

Despite us requesting a response by a specific date (11 September 2019), you failed to reply until 9
calendar days later, on 11 September 2019. Moreover, we note that the ‘Power Assist’ requirements to
the noted 2 nos. of doors had changed from ‘Not Required (“N”)’ to ‘Required (“Y”)’ (Table 2 refers).

We further record that attached to your response to RFI/0401/17385 was a sketch, enumerated as ‘ASK
4105 RFI-17385 Sheet 01 of 01’, prepared by the Employer’s Design Consultant (KPF), consisting of a
partial extract of a revised Door Schedule, changing the specific provision of power supplies for Doors
‘88-T-B20-0124.01’ and ‘88-T-B20-0124.02’ from ‘Not Required (“N”)’ to ‘Required (“Y”)’.
In addition, KPF’s response reads as follows:
“The Contractor to tap-off the power supply from the nearest dedicated 'Door Access Ring' circuit where
available. The total number of devices shall not exceed 10 nos. on each circuit. Where existing circuits
are not available, the Contractor shall provide a new circuit from the nearest EM-RP panel fed from a
16A circuit breaker. The feeder cable size shall not be less than 2.5mm2. Refer to ASK-4105 (RFI-040117385) (1 Sheet) for clarification.”
It is patently clear that the information reflected in the sketch attached to your response to
RFI/0401/17385 represents a change to the existing design and a change to our scope of works.
In order for us to undertake and instigate changes such as those noted above, we will require fully
coordinated revised IFC Drawings encapsulating the changes introduced in your RFI response, and
further remind you that SAA8 laid down mandatory procedures to be followed if additional works are
required, in so far as an EI and VO are needed for us to proceed with the aforementioned changes.
The provisions of Clauses 2.29 to 2.31 of SAA8’ pertaining to Variations are clear; we are not to proceed
with any Variation unless a Variation Order and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. In which
respect, it is your obligation to issue this Record first if you wish to instigate change; this is only after the
additional time and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.
Therefore, until such time as you take the action required of you in accordance with SAA8 Clause 2.29,
we are unable to proceed with implementing the changes noted above and will continue to proceed in
accordance with the existing IFC design to the extent we are able to. We trust this is clear.
We once again take this opportunity in reminding you that the responsibility under the Contract for the
design of doors and the integration of those parts of the Works which are intrinsically linked to the
doors, including hardware, security access control system, power supply and the like, lies with the
Employer. Our responsibility is to follow with due diligence the Drawings and Specifications, and it is our
position that we have discharged, and continue to discharge, this obligation with the necessary
expertise, care and skill that could reasonably be expected from an experienced contractor.
Yours faithfully,
