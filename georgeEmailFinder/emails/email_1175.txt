Subject: CEILING PACKAGE - MANPOWER REDUCTION/LACK OF WORK FRONTS
Dear Sir
With reference to the above subject and further to TCAJV's letter reference
MTB/TCA/CLOISALL/L/001088 dated 23'd September 2017, kindly be informed that Rev. 10.2
of the Target Programme to Completion, although contractually it isn't yet in place but we
regard as a document being sent 11FOR ACTION" and not /(FOR INFORMATION", was used as a
basis for us to achieve the targeted overall substantial completion date of the Works by 30th
June 2019. As such, M/s. Cloisall took the contents of your letter as a 11Contractual road map"
to follow the aforementioned Target Programme in order to monitor and control the works
to achieve the overall substantial completion date of the Works.
Relaying on the Target Programme to Completion rev. 10.2, M/s. Cloisall proceeded in

planning its resources accordingly in the required manner to follow the Contractor's planned
sequence. Doing so was the sole contractually-viable option because the alternative would
have set M/s. Cloisall on a diverging path with the Contractor.
Subsequently, M/s. TCAJV could not comply with its own Target Programme and, as a result,
was unable to provide M/s. Cloisall with the needed and timely access , thereby causing
significant delays beyond its control and disruptions of its work progress.
M/s. Cloisall recorded the lack of access through several official notifications addressed to
I th
M s. TCAJV, and as per reference letters no. 11388, 11389 and 11398 dated 18 October
2017, 23'd October 2017 & 24th October 2017, respectively. Furthermore, M/s. Cloisall requested
through its letter-11398 confirmation from M/s. TCAJV
in regards to the three (3) months look ahead (i.e., up to January 2018), in line with the
aforementioned Target Programme, so as to effectively plan its resources. To date, this
request remains pending without any feedback from M/s. TCAJV, while most of the areas
stipulated as "open access" per the supplied Target Programme remain to be inaccessible to
M/s. Cloisall, thereby causing a surplus of resources sitting idle on site and a significant loss in
manpower productivity and low utilization.
To elaborate on this point, M/s. Cloisall's estimated that the planned quantities of work to be
executed during the months of October 2017 and November 2017 and as per your 'Target
Programme to Completion Rev 10.2' are 25,646 m2 and 35,969 m2 respectively. Due to the
current site conditions and the lack of access to work fronts, M/s. Cloisall managed to
execute the equivalent to 16,280 m2 and 11,026 m2 respectively during this period. This
essentially reflected 63.48% and 30.65% percent work efficiency during the months of
October and November 2017, respectively.
Accordingly, M/s. Cloisall is hereby notifying you of its decision to gradually release from site
the excess/surplus manpower during the month of December 2017, while ensuring that the
remaining resources are sufficiently provided to carry out the works within the reduced
access areas provided by M/s. TCAJV. This approach is in line with the current site conditions,
reflects the below-target access areas we were promised and have planned our resources
around, and further aims to cut our losses in connection with the loss of productivity and/or
idle manpower on site.
Please note, and as previously mentioned by us in past correspondences, that " ... remobilizing
manpower is a lengthy process and we would require at least three (3} months to
reach back to the full swing."
Finally and pursuant to Sub-Clauses 10.1.4, 16.5, 21.2, and 27.1 of the Sub-Contract
Conditions, M/s Cloisall hereby reserves its right for any time and/or cost implications
pertaining to the lack of access to work fronts.
This letter is being sent for your information and necessary action.
Yours faithfully,
