Subject:Reply - Precautionary Order from the Abu Dhabi Court to Withhold Payments due to Advanced
Industries Group (Petition No: 2018/260)
Dear Sir,

We acknowledge receipt of your reply letter referenced in (3) above regarding the aforesaid subject
matter.
Please note that the execution order has been effected already by the Abu Dhabi Court, hence TCAJV is
not in any position to object such an order. Moreover, this “Execution Order” was issued entirely to M/S
Advanced Industries Group regardless of the location of operation in the United Arab Emirates.
Therefore, we reiterate our position to comply with the Execution Order requested from the Abu Dhabi
Court to provisionally withhold the payment of AED 1,959,792.27 you are owing to the “Attachment
Applicant”, M/S Al Meera Kitchens LLC, from amounts due to M/S Advanced Industries Group
(Interdicted/Defendant).
This is for your information and record.
Yours faithfully,
