Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers hereby to the revised Engineer's Instruction (E.1.) no.86 regarding changes in the
design of the entrance 1.2 at Bin Mahmoud Station as detailed in the Engineer's letter reference 1).

The Contractor notes that the revised E.I. no.86 relates only to the allowance in the Bin Mahmoud
Station's wall for a soft panel to enable a 6.8m wide future underpass and to spatial provisions in the
Architectural and MEP design for the future entrance.

Furthermore, the Contractor records the agreement at the Weekly Engineering Meeting held on 08
December 2015 that the MEP design for Bin Mahmoud Station will not include the provision of
connections or loads of any of the MEP systems for a possible future subway and remote entrance, in
line with the revised E.I. no.86.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Contractor informs the Engineer's Assistant that the MEP design for Bin
Mahmoud Station is progressing without provisions of connections or loads of any of the MEP systems
for a possible future subway and remote entrance, unless instructed otherwise.

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.
Yours faithfully,
