Dear sir

Further to notice of delay the contractor shares its concerns in respect of the subcontractor failure to
meet the deadlines set out in both revision 10 programme and the memorandum of understanding for
the release of on-account payments to the subcontractor. It is emphasized that, despite the substantial
financial funding provided by the contractor, the subcontractor has been unable to progress the
subcontractor works in a profitable fashion.
Please find below a summary of the status of the payments due to the subcontractor which is selfexplanatory.
To be clear the contractor has paid to the subcontractor more that aed 15 mil in excess to date. These
overpayments have been made in good faith and for the purpose of providing relief to the cash flow
difficulties of the subcontractor who allegedly was unable to pay its suppliers and subcontractor.
It is emphasized that the contractor has continues to provide this financial assistance despite the
subcontractors lack of commencement in respect of achieving the agreed interim milestones. The
contractor regrets that the subcontractors proposed target programme cannot be relied upon and that
no efforts appear to be made to avoid further slippages to the completion dates. For instance the
subcontractor workforce continues to be way below the required level to meet the target dates despite
numerous assurance that additional resources would be procured.
In view of the substantial value of on-accounts payment made to the subcontractor and the lack of
performance witnessed in return, the contractor hereby exercises its rights under the provisions of
clause 21.3.3 of the conditions of subcontract and demands from the subcontractor reasonable
evidence that his subcontractor and suppliers have been paid. Pursuant to the provisions of this clause,
the subcontractor is requested to proceed such reasonable evidence within 3 days of this notice.
Yours faithfully,
