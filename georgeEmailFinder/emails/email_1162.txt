Subject: Request for Confirmation of Variation Order Pursuant to COC Sub-Clause 20.1.4 (b)
for RFEI/0401/0300- Power Supply for Condensate Pumps of Blower Coils
Dear Sir,
With reference to the Engineer's response to RFEI/0401/0300 via the letter reference: {1) above, please
be advised that the information, comments, clarifications and/or instructions {the Instruction) contained
therein constitute an instruction of a Variation.
The Instruction requires to have a combined power supply for BCU and condensate pump and omit the
fused connection unit {FCU) along with the separate power supply for the condensate pump, as per the
sketch drawings reference ESK-1871 and ESK-1872.
In light of the above, we consider that, the Instruction contains a Variation that is not in the form of, or
which has not been confirmed in writing by the Engineer by way of, a formal Variation Order.
The Engineer has stated in its letter reference: {1) above, that the Engineer would prepare and issue an
Engineer's Instruction if the response to RFEI has resulted a potential change. However, the Engineer has
failed to issue the required Engineer's Instruction, until the date of this letter. As such, we had to carry
out
the works in accordance with the current IFC information, in compliance with the provision under
SubClause
20.1.5 [Right to Vary] of the Conditions of Contract and in compliance with the programme
requirements. Subsequently, ADDC has rejected these installations and commented that, "CE circuit
looping not allowed" {please refer to the Enclosure-1).
Considering the above and in accordance with Sub-Clause 20.1.4 {b) of the Conditions of Contract, we
again request the Engineer to provide a formal confirmation of Variation or issue an Engineer's
instruction
and revised Drawings and/or Specification pursuant to Sub-Clauses 11.3.3 and 20.1.1 (a), within seven
(7)
days of the receipt of this letter, in order to mitigate any further delays or further abortive works.
Unless and until the Engineer takes this required action, in accordance with Sub-Clause 20.1.5 of the
Conditions of Contract, we would not be able to proceed with the implementation of the above
described

Variation. We shall not be responsible for any delays or disruptions to the Works, or the cost of any
abortive works, as a result of the Engineer's late response to our request for confirmation of Variation.
Yours faithfully,
