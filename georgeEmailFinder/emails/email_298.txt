Dear Sir,
We write with reference to the Contractor's current manpower in relation to the Contractor's Baseline
Programme Rev 11.2 dates (Appendix E - Level One Programme) of the Settlement Agreement and
Amendment No.8 (SAA8).
The contractual Milestone MS9C Completion Date is due in less than 2 weeks' time {31 October 2019).
The Contractor's current manpower as of today shows mostly a declining trend to major trades and
Management Supervision and a detailed Variance Trend analysis is provided in Attachment 1. For
example the following Major Subcontractors are reducing their manpower throughout the last 2-3
months.
AI Ghurair: reduced by 606
Anel: reduced by 637
Bond: reduced by 114
PCE JV: reduced by 268 of which Naffco resource has declined by 68 people over the past 2 weeks
Total Key Subcontractors: reduced by 1,614
Overall: reduced by 2,747 representing an overall decline in resource by circa 24%.
As a result of the above, both the Engineer and the Employer have repeatedly requested the
Contractor to increase the manpower to mitigate the Contractor's delays, however, the Contractor has
not responded and conversely the manpower has been reduced. The decline in resources has been
also evidenced by the recent headcount of the Contractor's staff that was conducted in September
2019 (2) and has since declined further.
Considering the above evidenced shortage of manpower, we advise that the Contractor is responsible
for all the delays that have occurred due t o t his shortage of manpower (1).
We hereby reserve the Employer's rights pursuant to Clause 10.3 and Clause 16.6 of the Conditions of
Contract for the delays to the Project's Completion Date
Yours faithfully,
