Subject: Notice of Delay- Electronic Display Variations
Dear Sir,
We hereby acknowledge receipt of your above referenced correspondence titled "Notice of Delay
Electronic Display Variations" It is unclear from the body of the aforementioned letter as to what

"Electronic Display Variations" are being referred to in the so called delay notice. Therefore, we cannot
comment on any potential delay at this time.
For the sake of clarity, the Contractor has given no instruction to either deviate from the specifications
or put on hold the procurement of any display. As previously noted the Engineer has verbally indicated
that it fails to recognize any entitlement to additional costs sought via your RFV0-015.
You remain obliged to furnish Electronic Displays as set out within the specifications and drawings.
Yours faithfully,
