Subject Engineer's Delay Notification- Slow Progress to As-Built Submissions
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to the Contractor's correspondence (1), regarding the slow progress with the
As-Built submissions in response to our correspondence (2) and (3) .
The Contractor is referred to correspondence (2) to (10) where the Engineer's concerns rega rding the

Contractor's slow progress, poor quality of models, coord ination issues etc., have been recorded in
detail. The Engineer retains and reiterates the position conveyed in the above referenced
correspondence.
We again refe r to the Contractor's As-Built Schedule Rev. 6.0 and Rev. 7.0 and the weekly updates
provided to the Engineer for reporting progress. The Contractor has been failing to achieve t he
planned monthly targets consistently and as a result the Contractor's As-Built Schedule Rev 7.0 has
become redundant as noted in co rrespondence (2) and (3).
We note t hat the Contractor has failed to submit drawings in a t imely manner as per Sect ion 0133 00
requirements and has cont inuously slipped on t heir planned targets. Moreover, the Contractor
continues to deviate from addressing t he act ual reasons for t heir delays and the on remedying t his
situation despite the notifications issued by the Engineer.
The Contractor is therefore requested to exert its efforts on completing the submittals in line with its
submitted target (As-Built Schedule Rev.08) and mitigate the delays caused to date.
Yours faithfully,
