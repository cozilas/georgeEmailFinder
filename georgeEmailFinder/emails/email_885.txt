Subject Inspection Following Ceiling Panel Fall Incident
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to the Contractor's recent incident where a previously installed ceiling panel
became dislodged and fell 25 meters, landing in close proximity to personnel operating at level 2 of the
CP Area of the MTB.
The Engineer and the Employer are yet to receive any progress updates as to the agreed and required
reinspection
of each installed ceiling panel that was detailed in post incident meetings and to be
conducted as a matter of priority.
The Engineer requires the Contractor to provide the following overdue information for the ceiling panels
and the inspection hatches:
• A specific strategy detailing the re-inspections and what they will entail, as well as confirmation
of the re-testing criteria, and method.
• It was also suggested that the removal of the polythene and the required cleaning of these
panels will be done simultaneously, please confirm.
• Program scheduling the start and completion of each section, including inspection milestones.
• Prevention measures to avoid any further disturbance of panels and inspection hatches.
• Detail the WIR process and communication to the Engineer.

• Contractor's point of contact who will be leading this inspection activity. The Contractor is required to
respond with all the information requested within 3 working days upon
receipt of this letter.
Yours faithfully,
