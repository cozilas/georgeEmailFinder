Subject: Contractor’s Subsidence related Daily Reports
Dear Sir
We write with reference to the contractor’s obligation to provide daily and weekly reports to the
engineer and we note that the quality and accuracy of the reports are not in accordance with the
required standards of the contract.
It is imperative that these reports are corrected and a greater emphasis shall be given to this reporting
and monitoring tool. These reports are a mechanism for the contractor to ensure their production is on
target and to support their reporting to the engineer and the employer.
The contractor shall ensure that the reports are submitted daily, noting that thus far they are submitted
5 to 13 days late and also that they rectify their QA/QC process and improve the accuracy of the reports.
We hereby reserve the employer’s rights pursuant to clause 10.3 of the conditions of contract for all
delays associated with the above non-compliance of the contractor.
Yours faithfully
