Subject:SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26, E-Notice No. – E0009 –BOH Sign Material Procurement

Dear Sir,
The Contractor writes with reference to the delays incurred for the approval of the materials for the
back of house signage package, pending with the Engineer.
We hereby notify you pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8
that this event may cause delay to the Works and therefore we seek your swift resolution to avoid any
future disruption or delay pertaining to this matter.
Specifically, we had proposed during the meeting with the Employer/Engineer in September 2018, that
the approvals or determination regarding the aforementioned materials should be provided at the end
of October 2018. This is due to the fact that the materials will be supplied from Europe and it could take
approximately five (5) weeks to deliver to the site. However, to date, there is no feedback from the
Engineer and due to the Christmas holidays, the delivery could be further moved towards the end of
January 2019 even if an immediate approval is authorised. We have enclosed herewith, all documents
status for your information.
Your further guidance, decision and/or instruction is required at the earliest; failing which the Works are
likely to be delayed and/or disrupted.
We reserve our rights under the Contract pursuant to Sub-Clause 27.1 (Contractor’s Claims) to an
extension to the Time for Completion and additional Costs arising from the above described event.
Yours faithfully,
