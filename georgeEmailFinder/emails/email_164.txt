Engineer’s Response to RFI/0401/17401 – Additional Works Introduced at the Wall of Level L3.2
ceiling at the Hotel Building – Changes in Scope – Request for Engineer’s Instruction (EI) / Variation
Order (VO)
Dear Sirs,
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
Your response to RFI/0401/17401 detailed in Annex A hereto, represents a change in design and scope
and requires a valid EI and VO in order for us to integrate the same into the Works.
Potential Impact
Delay and disruption due to the events and circumstances outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
likely to impact on the achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within seven (7) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A

Description of the Event
On 25 August 2019 we raised RFI/0401/17401 (ref: 1), requesting clarification from you and/or the
Employer’s Design Consultant (KPF) in relation to clashes in the existing IFC design and specifically the
clash between the gypsum GYP ceiling located at CP Level L3.2 Hotel Building and an existing steel beam
(Figure 1 refers). In addition, we also requested further clarification as to whether or not there is a
requirement to provide any finishes to the wall at CP Level L3.2 Hotel Building.

(Reflected Ceiling Section)
Appended to RFI/0401/17401 were the following attachments:
•
‘Sketch 01’ (reproduced in Figure 2 below) and ‘Sketch 02’ (reproduced in Figure 3 below)
indicating the exact location of the discussed clash between steel beam and GYP ceiling;

•
Photographs i.e. ‘Sketch 03’, ‘Sketch 04’ and ‘Sketch 06’ (‘Sketch 06’ is as per Figure 4 below)
showing the exposed steel beam at the concerned location at CP Level 3.2 Hotel Building;
Figure 4
•
A sketch enumerated as ‘Sketch 05’ (as per Figure 5 below), which provides a suggestion as to
how to avoid the clash with the existing steel beam; and

Figure 5
•
An extract of RFI/0401/16877 submitted on 24 February 2019, within which we requested you
to clarify the ceiling type located at CP Level 3L.2 Hotel Building discussed herein. You later responded
on 18 March 2019 clarifying that gypsum ceiling 'GYP-01' shall be provided to the concerned location
and requested us to “…to provide related shop drawing together with the interface details of all the
adjoining trades for the Consultants approval”.
Therefore, after your request received via RFI/0710/16877, to provide a “…shop drawing together with
the interface details of all the adjoining trades…” to the Employer’s Design Consultant (KPF), we
submitted the requested shop drawing via SDS/0401/A/4818 and also via RFI/0401/17401 enclosed
thereto and as shown in Figure 5 above. Specifically, as shown in ‘Sketch 05’, the GYP ceiling has been
lowered to avoid clash with the existing steel beam. Figure 6 below has been added / reproduced in
order to compare the GYP ceiling shown in the IFC Drawing No: IFC ref MTC-A-32-TB-L_._-5.32-00.540 06
(Figure 1) with our Shop Drawing (Figure 5).

Accordingly, via RFI/0401/17401, we requested you to clarify and advise the following:
•
Whether you accept the GYP ceiling at CP Level 3.2 Hotel Building to be lowered as shown in our
‘Sketch-05’ attached thereto and reproduced herewith in Figures 5 and 6 above, in order to avoid clash
with the existing steel beams;
•
The movement joint detail as marked-up in our ‘Sketch-06’ (Figure 4 point 2 refers); and

•
Whether you require or not a finish surface/material at the bottom of the wall ‘Sketch-06 and
05’ (Figures 4 and 5 refers), since this is a visible surface to the public but the Design and IFC Drawings
do not show any finishing surface/material thereon.
We requested a response to RFI/0401/17401 by 4 September 2019. However, you failed to reply until
19 calendar days later on 23 September 2019. Notwithstanding the prolonged period in responding, the
Employer’s Design Consultant (KFP) advised the following (reproduced in Figure 7):
Figure 7
In this regard, KPF inter alia approved the lowering of the GYP ceiling and referred us to the attached
marked-up sketches thereto, wherein KPF provided further comments (Figure 7, item 1 refers). Also KPF
advised on the movement joint as requested (Figure 7, item 3 refers). Furthermore, the main changes
introduced via KPF’s response to RFI/0401/17401 are listed as items 2 and 4 shown in Figure 7 above
wherein KPF stated that “… 2- There is another exposed steel seen on the photo provided in the RFI
which needs to be closed with the gypsum wall with changing the curvature of the wall…”, and referred
us to the attached marked-up comments reproduced in Figure 8 below.
Figure 8
In addition, the other main change introduced by KPF’s comments which states that “…4- Provide a
stainless steel band at the bottom of the wall similar to top of the wall with the same height of the
band” is also reproduced in Figure 9 below.
Figure 9

In summary, we note the Design, IFC Drawings and the approved Shop Drawings, do not indicate any
gypsum wall to cover the exposed steel seen in Figures 4 and 8, nor is there a stainless steel band
required to be installed to the bottom of the wall at CP Level 3.2 Hotel Building (Figure 9 refers).
We reiterate once again that we are not the designers for this Project, the Employer’s Design Consultant
is. Consequently, we accept no liability or responsibility for any inconsistencies in the Design; this
remains with the Employer’s Design Consultant. In this regard, we put on record that the Works have
been constructed by us based on IFC Drawings prepared by KPF and issued by you.
In conclusion therefore, it is evidently clear that your/KPF’s response to RFI/0401/17401:
•
to cover the exposed steel beam with a gypsum wall while “keeping the starting point of curve”
of the wall…”;
•
to “provide a stainless steel wall expansion point”; and
•
to “provide a stainless steel band at the bottom of the wall similar to top of the wall with the
same height of the band”
represents a change.
However, SAA8 laid down strict guidelines to follow if additional works are required and therefore the
aforementioned change will warrant a valid Engineer’s Instruction (EI) and a Variation Order (VO) if you
require us to proceed with integrating the revised scope into the Works.
We therefore, take this opportunity in also reminding you of the provisions of Clauses 2.29 to 2.31 of
Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’) pertaining to Variations, in so far as we are not to
proceed with any Variation unless a Variation Order and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. In
which respect, it is your obligation to issue this Record first if you wish to instigate change; this is only
after the additional time and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.

Meanwhile, until such time as you take the action required of you in accordance with SAA8 Clause 2.29,
we are unable to proceed with implementing the changes noted above and will continue to proceed in
accordance with the existing IFC design to the extent we are able to.
Yours faithfully,
