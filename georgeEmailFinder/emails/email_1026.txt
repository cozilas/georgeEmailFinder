Subject: Amendment Agreement No.3-For On Account Monthly Advance payment
Dear Sir,
We write in response to your letter reference MTB/TCA/MOSART/L/000537 dated 6th March
2018, received on lOth March 2018.

The Contractor appears to be offering an "On Account Monthly Advance Payment" however
please be advised that we have not made such an application.
Any advance payment which is related purely to the value of our original Subcontract Price is
clearly not of any economic benefit to us and will not assist in financing our works or easing any
financial constraints imposed by our Banks.
The completion date for our Subcontract Works, in accordance with our original Subcontract,
was 27th February 2016, over two years ago and is in delay for reasons, which are not
attributable to our actions or lack of action. Expenditure on our Subcontract Works is clearly in
excess of the original Subcontract Price and our current cash-flow situation is negative, even
with previous "on account payments" and the proposed Amendment Agreement No.3.
We have submitted countless estimations of prolongation costs as requested by the Contractor
and the Engineer, supported by claims for costs associated with extensions of the Subcontract
time for completion. Our claims have not even received acknowledgement of receipt let alone a
response pursuant to the Conditions of Subcontract.
We very much regret that if unconditional payment of our claims is not made soon we shall be
forced into a position whereby our works will be affected. We therefore urge your swift
settlement of our claims for the benefit of all concerned with the project since failure to do so
may force us to take our dispute to arbitration.
Yours faithfully,
