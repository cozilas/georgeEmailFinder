Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to the Engineer’s Assistant’s Letter ref (1) wherein, the Engineer’s Assistant has
requested the Contractor’s confirmation of the amounts of the full and final settlement of variations.

With regards to the Al Waab office relocation, the Contractor records here, its rejection of the amount
proposed by the Engineer’s Assistant. However, notwithstanding the Contractor’s disagreement to the
valuation of the variation, the Contractor agrees with the allocation by the Engineer’s Assistant of the Al
Waab Office Milestone to the Provisional Sum Utility Diversion Section for payment purposes.

The Contractor shall respond to the Engineer’s Assistant’s proposed settlement amounts for the VE’s
referenced in letter (1), under separate cover.

Yours faithfully,
