Dear Sir,

Further to the Contractor's fully detailed interim ELS Claim submission (Revision 1) issued under cover of
reference 5, the Contractor confirms in accordance with Sub-Clause 20.1.6(b) of the General Conditions
of Contract (Volume 3), that no additional information in relation to the ELS Claim has been received by
the Contractor over the past month.

Accordingly, there is currently no change/update to the Revision 1 interim submission.

However, as the event giving rise to this Claim has a continuing effect and the Contractor is collating
further particulars requested by the Engineer's Assistant within reference 6, the Contractor shall be
submitting further interim Claim submissions with respect to the event giving rise to the ELS Claim at
monthly intervals as required by Sub-Clause/General Condition 20.1.6(b) of the General Conditions of
Contract.
Yours faithfully,
