Dear Sir

The contractor is writing with reference to the problems being encountered with the implementation of
the new Q-PRO procedures, Ashgal’s new web based permit application system.

The new system went live, and the old system would no longer accept any new permit applications,
after the 1st week of October 2015. After 3 weeks of registration the Contractor was able to issue its
first application for Bin Mahmoud station on the 5th November 2015. A further 8 applications have since
been issued for other stations, the latest one on the 20th December 2015. To date no permits have been
issued through the new online system.

The ongoing situation is now causing delays to the commencement and completion of certain works on
these stations.

Accordingly this letter serves as the Contractor’s extension of time notice pursuant to General Condition
(“GC”) 8.4.2 of Volume 3 of the Contract that the Contractor believes that it may be entitled to
extension(s) to the Time(s) for Completion pursuant to GC 8.4.1(c) as a result of the delays and, as the
Contractor’s “Claim” notice (for possible extensions of time and additional payment) pursuant to GC
20.1.2.

Please rest assured the notwithstanding the above the Contractor will endeavor to mitigate any delays
and additional costs in accordance with its contractual obligations.

Yours faithfully,
