Dear Sirs,
We refer to your above-noted letter and regret that it is in error. You are fully awar Z at the last
meeting that took place in order to close this matter discussed the whole of the PQC and associated
areas as per the subject title of both your and our letters. We can only imagine your letter's
unilateral introduction of a limited definition of the subject areas was a drafting error made by
persons not directly involved in that meeting.
Furthermore the joint inspection and review by our respective engineers who are specifically
experienced in such matters concluded that the level of damage caused by our trafficking of the
PQC etc. areas is of such a minor nature that the whole of the Apron areas trafficked by us can be
comfortably rectified at a the amount of cost represented by our offer of AED 3 million. The
suggestions that it would require such a sum to rectify the small defined area set out in your letter,
or that we are responsible for the widespread placing finishing and curing workmanship issues
extant in the PQC, are risible.
We trust that you will reconsider and set aside your letter and that as we requested, the Employer
withdraws his Notice of Claim number 9 made under Contract Clause 10.3 and accepts our fair and
reasonable offer. Until this matter is properly concluded we must suspend our intended and agreed
relocation of welfare facilities with the undoubted detrimental impact this will have on Project
progress
Yours faithfully,
