Subject :

Pending Re-Coding of Structural Shop Drawings

Dear Sir,
Further to the attached email correspondence, wherein a representative of the Employer confirms that
the Contractor had proceeded with the Works on Site in accordance with the applicable code 1
comments and therefore a number of shop drawings should be re-coded to enable the approval of the
relevant work inspection requests (WIRs), please be kindly advised that the re-coding of the shop
drawings listed below has not yet occurred.

The Engineer is hereby politely requested to change the code status of the above listed drawings thus
enabling the Contractor to close the related WIR.
Yours faithfully,
