Dear Sir,

Following receipt of your letter reference 1) above the Contractor hereby notes the Employerâ€™s
recommendation with respect to potential usage of National Transport Office (NTO) equipment for the
purposes of this Project.

The Engineer is requested to confirm by return whether the issue of an SAR is necessary by the
Contractor for the prequalification of NTO, or, whether the letter reference 1) above constitutes a
waiver in this regard.

Yours faithfully,
