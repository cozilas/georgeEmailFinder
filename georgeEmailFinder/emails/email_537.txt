Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence (1) and (2) regarding Appendix H to Payment Certificate
No. 65 and the monies which have been withheld due to the Contractor's open Non Compliance
Reports.
We reject the contractually unfounded assertions contained in the Contractor's letters and we direct
the Contractor to Clause 3.1.C 5 of Section 01 43 00 of the Specifications which provides "All
NonConformance
Reports (NCR) shall be cleared and closed before the Engineer will give final acceptance
for the work or for any portion of the Works".
The Contractor notwithstanding the Engineer's requests to address the non compliances recorded in
the open NCRs, has not taken the necessary steps or followed the process to implement the necessary
corrective and preventive measures. As a result, the Engineer proceeded in accordance with Clauses 5,
5.4, 5.4.7 of Schedule 11 (Payment Terms) of the Contract and deducted from the amount claimed by
the Contractor the items in the Statement with which the Engineer disagreed due to reasons

associated with the above stated Clauses.
The Contractor's assertion in correspondence (1) that the Engineer prior to issuing a deduction was
required to follow Clauses 10.3 (Employer's Claims) and 11.4 of the Conditions of Contract is incorrect.
The Engineer has proceeded to agree the amount and to date the Contractor has not disputed the
deductions made for its non-compliances and therefore a Determination was not required to t his end.
The Contractor has agreed on the amount certified in the Certificate and has submitted its invoice to
the Employer for payment.
The Engineer as stated above, has the right to proceed and deduct monies from the Contractor's
Interim Certificate for non compliances and for failure to perform its obligations under the Contract.
Should a dispute arises in connection to the Interim Payment Certificate, the Contractor pursuant
Clause 5.5 {Schedule 11) has the right to proceed according to Clause 27.3 (Dispute Resolution).
Regarding the alleged failure of the Engineer to particularize the monies withheld for NCRs 482 and
813, we direct the Contractor to the minutes of the bi-weekly Quality Meetings as well as to
correspondence {3), {4) and {5) where details regarding the Contractor's failure to appropriately
address the raised non-compliances are provided.
The Contractor is advised to focus its efforts to rectify its non-compliances and adhere to the quality
requirements of the Contracts.
Yours faithfully,
