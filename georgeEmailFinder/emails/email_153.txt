Subject:Clause 27.1.1: Notice of Claim – Delay Notice No. 0227
Suspension: Grouting East Elevation (GH19-GH20) Adjacent APM Head House
Dear Sir
On 6 February 2020 [3:19 PM] we e-mailed you in connection with the ‘Grout ingress to APM tunnel
from the expansion joints areas’ notifying you of the following event: “Due to very loose soil, we have
encountered continuous backflows even from the lower depths and collapses of the drilled bore holes
are also encountered”, and requested that you advise us what action to take.
You replied on 6 February 2020 [3:32 PM] stating:
“To avoid confusion, note that the drilling has been done on 02 Feb 2020 and observed on 02 Feb 2020.
However, CMA is very clear on addressing the status on these area to be on hold until further notice.
These was highlighted during our progress meeting 03 Feb 2020.
Please follow accordingly.” [Underlined and emphasis added]
Therefore, based on your instruction for us to place the noted work “on hold”, we hereby notify you in
accordance with Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1, of our entitlement to claim:

(i)
An extension of the Time for Completion of the Works pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.9.1(a)
‘Consequence of Suspension’, or alternatively, Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c) ‘act of prevention’; and
(ii)
An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.2 pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.9
‘Consequence of Suspension’, or in the alternative, damages for breach of Contract.
Interim and/or final details of the time impacts and adjustment to the Contract Price will be provided in
due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27 .1.5{a), (b) and (c).
Yours faithfully,
