Dear Sir,
This is a proposal under Sub-Clause 20.1.8 to amend the period within which the Engineer's Assistant is
required to respond to the Contractor's Claim received on 25 November 2015 under reference M006GDB- COM-LTR-02841 .

The proposed period is 42 days, ending on 17 February 20 16, automatically renewed by a further 42

the other Party.
Please confirm your approvalby signing and returning this letter to the Engineer's Assistant.

Yours faithfully,
