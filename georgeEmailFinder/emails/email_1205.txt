Subject I B-EY Hermes test delayed due to Etihad connectivity issue
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence (1) and we note that the IB - Hermes witness test could
not be performed on 13 December 2017 due the Contractor's Subcontractor (AOS). The Contractor
alleged that the Hermes test was delayed as a result of Etihad's unavailability however, we record that
your Subcontractor was not prepared for the test to be performed.
We further highlight that the IB- Sabre dry run was cancelled on 18 December 2017 due to SIT A test
platform issues.
The Contractor is requested to effectively managed its Subcontractors (Clause 12.9.6 Conditions of
Contract) and ensure that they perform as required under the Contract. You are also requested to
ensure systems readiness in advance of test sessions, with sufficient notice for all parties to be
prepared.

Yours faithfully,
