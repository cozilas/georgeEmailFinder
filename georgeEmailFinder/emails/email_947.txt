Subject Shop Drawings Classification and As-Built Drawings Statistics
Dear Sir,
Please be informed that the content of the submitted Transmittal (1) has been rejected by the
Employer for the following reasons which have been communicated to the Contractor via Email and
meetings:
1. In some cases, the drawings categorization is misleading resulting in incorrect allocation (AsBuilt
vs . Shop Drawings).
2. Some drawings sets have not been produced as part of the Shop Drawings but are required as
As-Built (e.g GA plans, sections, elevations).
3. Drawings scales missing from drawings register.
In addition to the above, the Contractor shall submit the final As-Built register based on the agreed
categories which have been sent to the Contractor on 10 January 2018 through El-722 (2) for approval.
Yours faithfully
