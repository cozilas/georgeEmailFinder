RE: Notice to Correct

Dear Sir,
Further to our correspondence referenced above (4) and your subsequent letter (5) whereby you state
that we refuse to accept the cost impact of the design changes concerning the wall access panels – this
assertion is incorrect. We have simply requested that you provide the substantiation demonstrating
your entitlement to the above, either by provision of the associated instruction and/or the calculations
highlighting why the existing specification was insufficient – neither of which have been provided
despite numerous requests.
Please be reminded that it is your contractual obligation to provide the requested information in a
timely manner and to progress the Subcontract Works with due expedition and without delay, neither
delaying nor adversely affecting the performance of TCAJV or other Subcontractors – see Subcontract
clause 8.1.2 [Subcontractors Obligations].
Furthermore, it has come to our attention that you are now withholding materials and failing to deliver
these to site despite you receiving instructions for these particular access panels – see email attachment
(6). As a result we hereby issue this Notice to Correct under Clause 22.1 of the Subcontract to deliver all
materials immediately in line with the agreed construction schedules.

In view of the above, you are hereby instructed pursuant to Clause 11.3 [Instructions of the Contractor]
to provide a Material Delivery Schedule within two (2) days from the receipt of this letter. The schedule
should detail quantities of current materials on site (MOS), the current status of all material orders and
their anticipated delivery to site.
Please note that any delays, costs, losses and/or expenses incurred by us and/or any other
Subcontractor(s) arising as a result of your failure to undertake the said works expeditiously shall be at
your risk and recovered from your account in accordance with the Subcontract clauses 10.3, 16.6.1 and
other relevant clauses.
This is for your utmost attention and immediate action.
Yours faithfully,
