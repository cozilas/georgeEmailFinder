Subject:Re: Engineer's Instruction No. 786 – Proposal - Outstanding Door Issues
Dear Sir,

We write with reference to your letter (2) in which you enclosed an Engineer’s Instruction (EI) No. 786
requesting us to provide a Rough Order Magnitude (ROM) and a Time Impact Analysis (TIA) with respect
to changes to 41 no. doors.
We write to express our disappointment that you have elected to issue an EI only for 41 nos. doors
disregarding the remaining hundreds of outstanding doors listed in our letter ref (1) and also in all of our
E-Notices and Delay Notices listed in Annex A hereto.
Consequently, we put on record, that despite our numerous requests to date, you have failed to provide
clarification and/or issue EI’s for the respective outstanding doors.
We therefore, inform you that your ongoing failures identified in our numerous correspondences are
continuing to prevent us from the completion of the Works. Such acts of prevention on your part are
undeniably causing delay and disruption to the completion of our Works and are continuing to prevent
the achievement of Milestone MS09B and Milestone MS09C.
Yours faithfully,
