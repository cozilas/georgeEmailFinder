Please note that due to this non-payment, the progress of works has been seriously affected and is
continuing to be affected since July 2020.
It has come to our attention that the respective Interim Payment Certificates for the payments listed
above, have been signed by you, however, for reasons which are not clear to us, the release of the
payment is being withheld and delayed as shown in the table above.
This is not only unacceptable and unreasonable, but it is also against the Payment Terms Clause 6.3 of
the Letter of Award (LOA), wherein it states that all “payments shall be made by bank transfer in 30 days
from the receipt date of monthly payment application”.
As a result, this is causing detrimental cashflow and financial issues to our company and has impacted
and is continuing to impact our ability to progress with the works constructively. Moreover, it is

affecting our ability to settle our financial obligations not only to our suppliers, creditors but most
importantly, the wages of our staff and workers.
We have been supporting and financing the project for the last few months, but our ability to continue
to do so, will significantly be affected in the event the payments are further delayed.
Please be informed that in the event any negative consequences arise to our company due to your
mentioned actions, then we shall hold you fully responsible.
In view of the foregoing, we urgently request you to treat this request for payment immediately and we
look forward to receiving the payment within today or by maximum tomorrow.
In the event no action is taken on your part to release the payments, then there will be a risk of
manpower pulling-out of the works and the progress of works will be negatively affected.
This is for your information and urgent action.
Yours faithfully,
