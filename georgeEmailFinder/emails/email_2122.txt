Dear Sir,

Contractor is reminded to provide the Engineer's Assistant (EA) with the Request for Change (RfC) for
the first stage Concrete and Steel Walkways in Tunnels.

Contractor has proposed changing the Employer's Requirements in Volume 6 Sub-Clause 10.5.1.1. The
understood proposed change would allow a provision for steel cable trays, steel handrails and steel
walkways instead of cable trays, concrete cable ducts and walkways (emergency and maintenance
walkways) in line with reference 4).

Pursuant to Employer's Requirements Volume 6, Sub-Clause 1.2.6.2, steel walkways in tunnels can be
regarded as an accessible asset item of the tunnel structure. Accordingly, the accessible asset items and
sub-items may have a shorter design life. They may be replaced, refurbished and maintained such that
the design life of the asset is ensured. In this respect hot dipped galvanised steel can be used for the
construction of the steel walkways (non-slippery walking surface) and handrails in the tunnel sections.

Contractor is required to provide the RfC to capture the above within 5 days of receipt of this letter.
Yours faithfully,
