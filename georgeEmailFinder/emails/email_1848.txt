Dear Sir,
Engineer's Assistant refers to letter reference 2), wherein the Contractor was directed to submit a
quotation for any cost and time impact relating to Extension of the Mock-up Facility. Engineer's
Assistant issued a reminder under letter reference 1}, to submit a quotation without further delay, but
to date Contractor has failed to do so.

It has been brought to the Engineer's Assistant's attention recently that the cost of the Mock-up
extension may exceed the QAR 4m order of magnitude cost provided by the Contractor under letter
reference 3). Engineer's Assistant is concerned with this development as an expenditure cap of QAR 4m
was established for this work.

Contr ctor shall submit his quotation as directed above, including a breakdown of the figures into
expen iture to date and cost to complete, based on the scope of works known to the Contractor.

Yours faithfully,
