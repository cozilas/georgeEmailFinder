Subject: Value Engineering Proposal – Main Roof Gutter Grating Omission

Dear Sir,
We refer to our Value Engineering for the cancellation of the aluminium walkway grating that covers the
main roof gutters proposed via our document submittal (1) and note the following:
First and foremost, this Value Engineering proposal was issued to you on 21 January 2018, i.e. over a
year ago.
During subsequent meetings attended by representatives of both the Engineer and the Employer, we
were informed that this Value Engineering proposal was being considered and under review. The
minutes of these meetings held in January 2018 prove this. Please refer to point 6.1 in (2) and point 4 in
(3) (all attached for ease of reference).
The removal of the aluminium gutter grating was also subject to detailed discussions in the months of
May, June and July 2018. During these discussions, representatives of the Employer verbally assured
that the proposed removal of the gutter grating was acceptable and that a letter confirming this was
under preparation. Although the referred correspondence was not issued, in the roof works notes dated
06 August 2018 (4) it was recorded that such ‘formal confirmation is imminent’.
As evidenced by the attached documents, this issue clearly predates the effective date of Settlement
Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (SAA8). We confirm that both the cost and the time optimization
associated to this Value Engineering were contemplated for inclusion in SAA8 and therefore captured
under Clauses 1.7.2 and 1.7.4.
For the sake of clarity, we reiterate that this Value Engineering is an integral part of the settlement
proposal agreed upon by us with the Employer on 04 September 2018.
We trust this matter is now clear and closed.
Yours faithfully,
