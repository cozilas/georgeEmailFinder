Dear Sir,

The Engineer's Assistant is in receipt of Contractor's letter reference 1) and would like to clarify the
following :

•
Engineer's direction reference 3) is a request for Contractor's quotation (cost and time) in terms
of savings related to the MEP and civil works only.
•
The RFC indicated in the Engineer's Assistant's letter reference M006-LBE-ENG-LTR-00674 dated
12 April 2016 is not yet approved, therefore the Engineer's Assistant adheres to Contractor's suggestion
and the requirements related to the under-platform projectors are to be included in the Provisional Sum
Architectural Works packages as an optional item.

Thus, the Contractor is hereby requested to comply with Engineer's Assistant letter reference 2) and
submit the requ ted quotation by 25 August 2016.

Yours faithfully,
