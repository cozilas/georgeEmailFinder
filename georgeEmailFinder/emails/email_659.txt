Subject:Scope Transfer from APM to TCAJV
Dear Sir,
We are in receipt of the above referenced letter (1.) from CCEP and wish to inform you as follow.

The comment “…obstructed work by TCAJV…” is incorrect as this refers to the Subsidence of the Sewer
Line for which we are not responsible.
Furthermore, we are not in a position to respond to this letter and hereby request the Engineer to
ensure that all correspondence from Other Contractors with whom the Employer is engaged with on or
near the Site be addressed to TCAJV formally through the appropriate mechanism under the Contract.
Should the Employer wishes to proceed with this arrangement, the Engineer shall be required to obtain
the Employer’s approval prior to issuing a Variation under Clause 20 (Variations and Adjustments) of the
Conditions of Contract and pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.29, 2.30 and 2.31 (Variations) of the Settlement
Agreement and Amendment No. 8.
Yours faithfully
