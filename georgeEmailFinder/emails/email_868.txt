Subject Room Completion Stage-1, Zutec Update
Dear Sir,
We write further to the Engineer's letter referenced (1) above with regards to updating the backlog of
the Room Completion in Zutec in order to be aligned with the physical room completion update
provided by the Contractor's construction team.
On 28 March 2018, during the Weekly Meeting as referenced in {2), item 7 has recorded "TCAJV
mentioned that Zutec update will be 1st week of April".
The Contractor has failed to meet the above mentioned committed date as well as numerous other
committed dates provided by the Contractor in various meetings. The most recent given on 11 April
2018, during the weekly meeting referenced (3), Item 6, has recorded "Zutec update is missed and
TCAJV

is forecasting end of April to complete this task, CMA/ADAC says this not acceptable and TCAJV to exert
effort to close this task" .
The Engineer hereby records that as of 27 April 2018, as per the weekly update referenced (4), the
Contractor has failed to complete the backlog update of Zutec, as demonstrated in the table below
whereby the completed rooms according to Zutec is 291 vs. 2,134 claimed by the TCAJV. The Engineer
notifies the Contractor that the delay in updating the backlog in Zutec will prevent the
ongoing efforts to mitigate delays by the Contractor.
The Contractor shall be fully responsible for any delays that may occur as a result of the above.
Finally, the Contractor is requested to submit the action plan for Zutec backlog update not later than 3
days from the receipt of this letter.
Yours faithfully,
