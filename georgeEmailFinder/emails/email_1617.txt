Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to letters 2) and 3) whereby the Engineer's Assistant reminded the Contractor that
the requested price quotation and possible impact to the Time for Completion for the curtailing of the
Landscape Design at the completion of the M2 design stage (including SONO) for Joaan Station and at
the completion of the M3 design stage (including SONO) for the other Stations, to avoid overlap with
design works to be carried out by others, is still pending.

However, the Contractor refers the Engineer's Assistant to letter reference 4) whereby "the Contractor
would require clarification of the above-mentioned items in order to ascertain and quantify the full
extent of the risks and associated costs and of the impact on the Time for Completion" and records that
its requests for clarification under letter reference 4) were not addressed.

Pending receipt thereof, the Contractor can provide only the current estimate for the Landscape design
cost, in the amount of QAR 567,774 as detailed in the Architectural Finishes Design Consultant's letter
reference
1) enclosed herewith.

Notwithstanding the clarifications requested by the Contractor under letter reference 4), if the above
change in the Scope of Works is required, the Contractor hereby requests the Employer's written
instruction as soon as possible in order to minimize abortive design.

In addition, the Contractor records the Engineer's Assistant's request for the Contractor to Hand-Over
the Landscape Design for Joaan Station at the completion of the M2 design stage (including SONO)
within 10 days, communicated in the M3 AB Workshop #5 (Landscape) meeting held on 31 May 20 16.

If it's the Employer's intention for the Contractor to cease further design work after the completion of
the M2 Landscape Design for Joaan Station, the Engineer's Assistant is kindly requested to issue the
Engineer's Instruction to that effect or to suspend further Design pursuant to Sub-Clause 8.8 of the
Contract pending issue of such.

In the absence of an instruction to the contrary, notwithstanding the requested quotation, the
Contractor hereby informs the Engineer's Assistant that the Landscape Design for all Stations is
progressing according to its current Scope of Works.

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification. Yours faithfully,
