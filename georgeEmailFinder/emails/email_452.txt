Subject: Engineer's Instruction No. 758- Proposal- Modifications to the SEHA Clinic to Comply with DOH
Requirements
Dear Sir,
We are in receipt of your letter (3) above, confirming the oral instruction of the Employer, for not
proceeding with the Variation Proposal for the modifications of SEHA Clinic.
As you are aware, since the receipt of the original request all parties involved in the Variation

Proposal preparation process have been in continuous correspondence, have attended meetings
and workshops, both on the quantum and time impact aspects. In addition to our Commercial
Team resources, all Subcontractors impacted by this scope have worked on and incurred costs for
this ROM Preparation.
The cost of preparing ROM Proposals, as instructed by the Engineer, is part of the proposal itself:
in good faith we have diverted resources into moving towards agreement with the expectation of
the execution of a Variation. The fact that it was suddenly decided not to proceed to site works
was not due to any failure on our part and we therefore believe all our costs expended should be
recoverable under clause 2.29 of SAA8
We hereby submit our full details of these costs and look forward to your issue of a Variation
Order in this respect.
Yours faithfully,
