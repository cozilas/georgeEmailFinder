Subject: Notice of Back Charge- M/S Cloisall's Damage Notification on Pier 3 Level 2, Zone 3
With reference to M/s. TCA JV's Letter Reference MTB/TCA/CLOISALL/L/001192 dated 21st of January
2018, kindly be informed that the statement made by M/s. AI Gurair Construction is irrelevant to the
damages made to M/s. Cloisall's ceiling.
As discussed in the attached email correspondence with M/s. TCA JV Engineer, the Scaffolding was
erected by M/s. Cloisall on the gth of January 2017 and the damage done to the Glass Fin was on the
14th of January, thus the broken Glass Fin was damaged after Scaffolding erection and therefore
clearing M/s. Cloisall of any wrong doing.
Also, M/s. AI Gurair Construction has failed to provide a Damage Report witnessed and signed by M/s.
TCAJV in regards to these damages.
In absence of such report, such allegations can't be ascertained and therefore M/s. Cloisall will not
accept any contra charges towards the same either in the time-being and/or in the future for this case
and/or any other similar cases unless it is substantiated with the Damage Report(s) duly signed by
M/s. TCAJV.
Accordingly, M/s. Cloisall requests M/s. TCAJV to raise such notice(s) in a proper timely manner
inclusive of Damage Report(s) duly signed by M/s TCAJV; otherwise, such notice(s) will be considered
as nil and void from M/s. Cloisall's side, and in the time-being, M/s Cloisall rejects such notice and in
return refuses any back charges to be accounted to M/s. Cloisall.
Furthermore, the damage done to the Glass Fin belonging to M/s. AI Gurair Construction is irrelevant
to the damages done to M/s. Cloisall's ceiling by M/s. AI Gurair. M/s. Cloisall reserves its right to claim
any additional cost and time implication since M/s. TCA JV Engineer signed the Damage Report and
the Day Work Sheet submitted by M/s. Cloisall (ref: CL0/0401/MTB- CEILING/CONT/11182/17).
We trust the above meets your approval and clarifies the matter, however, should require any further
information, please contact the undersigned.
Yours faithfully,
