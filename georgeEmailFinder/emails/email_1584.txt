Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to its letter at reference 1 which states: " The implementation of SAP
requirements, which must be formally instructed, constitute a Variation ...In this respect the Engineer is
kindly requested to obtain the Employer 's written confirmation of its agreement to implement the
revised SAP drawings and instruct accordingly ..."

Consequently, within reference 1 the Contractor requested a response, together with the requested Var
iation Instruction (pursuant to General Condition ("GC") 13.1.1) and the required Employer's specific
written approval of same (pursuant to GC 3.1.4 (m)) with respect to the issue of the SAP drawings, by 17
September 2015.

Unfortunately, contrary to the Contractor's request no response to reference 1 has been received by the
Contractor to date and in addition, no Variation Instruction and no Employer's specific written approval
of same has been received with respect to the issue of the SAP drawings. However, the Contractor can
confirm that it has proceeded to revise its Design to incorporate the SAP drawings' requirements.

The Contractor considers that the post-Contract issued SAP drawings contain changes to the Employer's
Requirements and/or the Works and are causing the Contractor to incur additional costs and may cause
delay to the Time(s) for Completion.

Accordingly, due to the lack of response to reference 1 by the requested date of 17 September 2015, the
Contractor has now become aware of an event or circumstance giving rise to a claim . Therefore, the
Contractor hereby notifies the Engineer's Assistant of the Contractor 's intention to claim for its
entitlement (1) for any extensions to the Time(s) for Completion for any delays that may be incurred due
to the post- Contract issue of SAP drawings and, (2) for payment of the additional costs that are/will be
incurred due to the post-Contract issue of SAP drawings, all in accordance with GC 8.4.2 and GC 20.1.2
of Volume 3 of the Contract.

Please rest assured however that notwithstanding the above the Contractor will endeavour, in
accordance with its contractual obligations, to mitigate any delays and additional costs incurred due to
the post-Contract issue of SAP drawings.

Yours faithfully,
