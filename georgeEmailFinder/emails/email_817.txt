Subject:Reply – EI 722A Proposal for Reduction in AS-Built Drawings
Dear Sir,
We acknowledge receipt of your letter referenced in (3) above, however, your reply is somehow
ambiguous since you failed to address the purpose of the Engineer’s Instruction (EI) accordingly.
Therefore, we need you to confirm whether your ROM Proposal is zero and the reason as such.
Furthermore, if the EI genuinely confirms the requirement for a reduction in the As-Built Drawings, then
you are required to submit a ROM for the cost saving without any further delay.
If you fail to do so within fourteen (14) days from receipt of this letter, then we will make our own
proposal on your behalf and such an amount will be deducted from your account accordingly through an
issuance of a Variation Order.
This is for your information and necessary action.
Yours faithfully,
