Dear Sir,
The underperformance of Contractor's tunnel subcontractor, SELi, on TBMs 5 and 6, has been discussed
at several meetings and is a continual subject of several Engineer's Assistant letters.

Contractor's letter referenced at item 4. Above confirmed that the mobilization of staff for TBM 5 was
completed.

The Engineer's Assistant has addressed the understaff ing of TBMs 5 and 6 in several letters to the
Contractor and the Contractor has continually responded with revised organization charts for SELi to
indicate proposed staffing levels with arrival dates in Doha. The Contractor never indicated which of his
own staff will be mobilized to these TBMs in order to monitor and manage the subcontractor .

The quality of the rings built on TBM 5 has been addressed in several meetings and recorded in the
Engineer's Assistant letters referenced at items 6 and 7 above. To date Contractor has failed to respond
to MOOS-LBE-TUN-LTR-0 0036, where the response was required by 22 July 2015, and has failed to
provide evidence that appropriate actions have been instigated as a result of MOOS-LBE-TUN-LTR00048. Both letters, (00036 and 00048) emphasized the necessity for Contractor and SELi to improve
safety, quality and performance of the works.

The progress of TBMs 5 and 6 is far less than the progress of TBMs 3 and 4, which has the same backup
configuration and reasonably similar ground conditions. The progress for the last five days is provided
within the tabled below:

TBM NO.

In the Weekly Management Review meeting of 29 July 2015 the Contractor had reported that a
discussion with SELi will be held and that SEU will be given two weeks to improve their progress on both
TBMs 5 and 6.

Contractor is reminded that their obligation pursuant to Sub-Clause 4.2.1 b) is for Contractor to ensure
that they:
"shall engage and retain Subcontractors who are highly qualified and experienced and will coordinate
the activities of the Subcontractors so that the Works are designed and executed in a proper and
workmanlike manner;"

If positive improvement is not evident by no later than Thursday 13 August 2015, then the Contractor
will be required to remove SELi from the project in order to not jeopardize the Gold Line KITO dates for
Lot
2.3b tunneling.

In addition, given this extremely poor performance, the Employer's confidence in considering the
inclusion of the tunneling options from the Contract, as noted in Volume 5 Sections 1 and 2, is being
undermined and placed in serious jeopardy by the Contractor.

Contractor is required to respond with details of Contractor's remedial action plan by COB 15 August
2015. This response must include an action plan that provides details for the mobilization and
management of appropriate tunneling crews to replace those of SELi.
Welook forward to your positive focus and action on the above.
Yours faithfully,
