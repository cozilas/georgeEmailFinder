Subject: Condition Survey for Outer and Inner Areas between GH39-38, GH40-39 and
Dear Sir,
We confirm receipt of your letters referenced in (1) to (3), wherein you record having conducted a
"condition survey" of the outer and inner areas between GH39-38, GH40-39 and GH41-40 on 09
September 2018 and you advise us that during the said survey you recorded damages to both the
PQC texture and completed joint sealant which you blame on us.
We confirm that similar correspondence has been exchanged previously and that our position in
relation to your accusations remains unchanged. Some reasons for rejection include, among others,
the following ones:
1. Your letters contained a generalized statement that neither described the damage nor
identify its root cause. You simply made reference to damages found at different locations
where our materials were apparently/allegedly stored.
2. The area in question is accessible to other third parties as well and the alleged damages
could have been caused by anyone, including L& T themselves.
3. We contend that tyre marks cannot be considered as damage to concrete, owing to the fact
that the passenger boarding bridges (a permanent assembly) will produce tyre marks,
similar to those shown in the photograph provided by you, during its operation.
4. The photographs showed concrete cracks, gaps and holes which can be caused by a myriad
of reasons; reasons such as concrete shrinkage, creep, insufficient concrete support and
poor workmanship. The cracks and gaps obviously affected the concrete joint sealant's
appearance and performance.
In view of the above and in the absence of any evidence to support the accusations, we reject your
supposition in tagging us as responsible for these damages. In a similar way, we do not accept your
statement that "repair/replacement charges will be evaluated and the appropriate mechanism

un.der the Contract for the deduction of monies shall be implemented".
Yours faithfully,
