Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to letter referenced 1above regarding the request for quotation under Clause
13.2.1 of the Conditions of Contract for the deletion of Diesel Generators in Stations and Tunnel Power
Supply Substations. The work included in this 13.2.1 request for quotation was instructed through
Engineer's Instruction No. 78 (reference 2), and as such the design has been developed to reflect this
requirement.

To facilitate providing a quotation at this stage the Contractor would have to issue an.Instruction to its
Design Consultant to produce the design based on the original requirements, which would create
unnecessary costs for the Employer and no real benefit. The Contractor would note that as the design
has been developed on the basis of the Engineer's Instruction, and issued to the market as part of the
MEP packages the Employer will gain the full benefit associated with this Instruction.

Yours faithfully,
