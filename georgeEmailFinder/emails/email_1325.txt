Dear Sir,
With reference to 1) above regarding the Engineer's text instruction to omit light cover at the Public
Gallery ceiling as set out a Variation previously instructed in Bulletin no. 7 reference 3) in respect of the
light cove at the Public Gallery cei ling as set out revised Drawings. As such, our RFVO ref. 2) above may
be
considered withdrawn.
However, we urge the Engineer to apply consistent protocols in defining and instructing Variations
particularly in instances of reversa1 of previously issued Variations for implementation with immediate
effect. We further remind the Engineer that he is also required to update t he IFC documents in a
consistent manner in order to avoid Construction errors and omissions inadvertently introduces as in
the
case of Engineer's Instruction no. 62 in ref (1) above.
In accordance with Clause 9.10.3 of the Conditions of Contract, we hereby give the Engineer notice of
likely abortive works, disruption and delay to the progress of the Works and potentially increase the
Contract Price due errors arising from failure to resolve discrepant IFC Drawings.
Yours faithfully,
