ANNEX A
DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT
Introduction
The matters described in detail below, concern delays to the Time for Completion of the Works due your
unreasonable Status Code 3 comments issued in response to various Airport Operation System
Document Submittals, associated with the As-Built Matrixes Submittals for the Airport Operation System
(AOS) works.
The purpose of this notice is to provide a detailed history of the events and circumstances giving rise to
the delay and elaborate on the act(s) of prevention on your part that is impeding the completion of the
Works.
Chronology of Events
Background
In or around April 2016, we submitted various Shop Drawing Submittals encapsulating numerous Airport
Operational Systems (AOS) Shop Drawings for all of the AOS sub-systems (including for example, the
FIDS, CUPPS and CUTES etc.). This included without limitation Shop Drawing Submittal No.
SDS/0401/FC/0020 Rev. 00 enclosing twenty (20) Airport Operational Database (AODB) Shop Drawings
associated with the FIDS and CUTES systems; all of which were classified Status Code 2 on 20 April 2016
(refer to Table 1 below).

These Drawings included inter alia, Shop Drawing No: 401-STA-FC-07-10-3.11-AODB-SD-001, provide
the format and the information / headings of the Airport Operational Database (AODB) Matrix which

would be used for the AOS As-Built Drawings (in the manner shown in Figure 1 below). The information
recorded in the snapshot shown below also indicates your resultant Status Code 2 comments annotated
thereupon.
Figure 1
As shown in Figure 1 above, the headings which would be added to the Matrix for all the AOS As-Built
Drawings have been agreed, i.e. ‘Building’, ‘Device Type’, ‘Level’, ‘Sector’, ‘Zone’, ‘Room Name/Area’,
etc.
Following which on 15 May 2018 we received Engineer’s Instruction (‘EI’) No. 722A (under cover of
letter ref: MTC-CMA-TCA-0401-LTR-09481 dated 15 May 2018), in relation to the reduction of a number
of As-Built Drawing Submittals associated with various disciplines including Airport Operation System
(AOS) works. Attached to EI-722A was an As-Built Drawing Schedule, listing numerous As-Built Drawings
to be provided by us, and requesting these be segregated into two categories to ‘Mandatory’ and
‘Elective’. Very simply: ‘Mandatory’ means exactly that; the drawings have to be provided in the form of
a drawing as per the usual practice in the MTB Project; and ‘Elective’ means that they are not required
to be provided in the form of a drawing, but only in the form of an excel format via a Document
Submittal.
A partial extract of the As-Built Drawing Schedule attached to EI-722A, is reproduced in Figure 2 below.
Figure 2
Subsequent to which we sent you an email on 21 September 2018 [9:01 PM] (reproduced in Figure 3
below) attached to which was a matrix providing a list of AOS As-Built Drawings in the manner shown in
Figure 4. As you can see we requested you to review, comment and approve the As-Built Drawings listed
therein and also to provide the final confirmation of the Matrix template with the headings and
information required.
Figure 3
Figure 4
It is also worth noting that numerous workshops have also taken place between us in relation to the
same, to agree on the information / headings which would be included on the AODB Matrix and the
format of the excel sample / template which would be used for the AOS As-Built Drawings listed in
Figure 4 above.
It is patently clear that with our email and the ‘Excel’ Schedule of AOS As-Built Drawings attached
thereto, (see Figure 3 and Figure 4 above), we listed the specific As-Built Drawings adhering to the
requirements of EI 722A that were to be prepared and submitted by us for your review and approval
and also the exact ‘Excel’ format / template of the Matrix documents incorporating the headings /
information required etc.
In the event, we received your response to our e-mail, on 23 October 2018 [4:10 PM] wherein you
attached our excel file of the AODB Matrix. You also provided the following series of comments
(reproduced in Figure 5), which essentially approved the excel Matrix template and the list of As-Built
Drawings.

This E-Notice No. 0230
Further to which we then proceeded with submission of the following Document Submittals
incorporating various matrixes for the Airport Operational Systems [as per the agreed template],

together with lists of all relevant AOS As-Built Drawings [which had also been agreed], in the manner
shown in Table 2 below.

Article 1.3 of Specification Section 013300 ‘Submittal Procedures’ governs the processing time by which
you are contractually obligated to respond to our Submittals. On the basis that our Document
Submittals were all at Rev. 00, then these should have been responded to by you 21 calendar days later,
i.e. on 19 January 2020. However, Table 2 above shows that you exceeded the contract review period
for responding to our Submittals by 20 and 21 calendar days. At this stage of the Project, these delays
are unacceptable.
Notwithstanding, the information recorded in Table 2 shows that we received a Status Code 3 response
to all of our Submittals; all of which were accompanied with a series of comments as per Figure 6 below.
Figure 6
We are surprised at receiving such unreasonable, general and vague comments in reply to all ten
Document Submittals – particularly the statement that “there is no stated scope or purpose for this
document”, especially considering the fact that the format of the Matrix documents and list of AOS AsBuilt Drawings had been agreed previously as discussed above.
We therefore put on record that your unreasonable comments issued in response to all of ten
Document Submittals listed in Table 2 above, particularly at this stage of the Project will – considering
the fundamental importance of the Airport Operational Systems to the functioning of the Airport–
invariably delay testing and commission and associated inspections, thus invariably delaying the Time
for Completion. Accordingly, we urge you to consider re-coding all of the Document Submittals
referenced in Table 2 above, by return to avoid any further delays. Please note that any delays incurred
to date or which may be incurred by us as a result of your failure to approve the AODB Matrix for the
AOS As-Built Drawings, shall be at your risk.
Yours faithfully,
