Dear Sir,

Further to the Contractor's formal Claim No 001 January 2016 update issued under cover of reference 3,
the Contractor now confirms, in accordance with General Condition ("GC") 20.1.6(b) of Volume 3
of the

Contract, the following updated costs in relation to the incorrect/late rejectio n of Gulf Prefab House
Factory LLC for the provision of the Contractor's offices.

The only known increased costs incurred since the January 2016 Claim 001 update are financing costs as
no payment has been received by the Contractor for the said Claim.

As explained within the January 2016 Claim 001 update, the total Claim to date excluding finance costs is
OAR 4,079,953.00. Finance costs are being incurred by the Contractor at a rate of 4.25% per annum .
Therefore, the totalfinance costs to date are:

OAR 4,079,953.00 (Total Claim costs to date excluding finance costs) x 494 days (Period from initial
Claim submission date of 23.10.14 to 29.02.16)/365 days x 4.25% pa = QAR 234,681.00.

Overheads and Profit ("OHP") upon finance costs are QAR 234,681.00 x 13% = QAR 30,509.00.

Therefore, finance costs to date, including OHP upon same, are QAR 234,681.00 + QAR 30,509.00 = QAR
265,190.00.

This provides a February 2016 updated Financial Summary for Claim 001 as follows:

FINANCIAL SUMMARY:

As the event giving rise to this Claim has a continuing effect (i.e. increased financing costs if payment is
not made against Claim 001), the Contractor shall be submitting further interim Claim submissions with
respect to the event giving rise to Claim Nr 001 at monthly intervals as required by GC 20.1.6(b) of the
General Conditions of Contract.

The Contractor also takes this opportunity to remind the Engineer's Assistant that the Contractor
continues to maintain its right to entitlement for additional payment/adjustment of the Contract Price in
accordance with the arguments and information provided within its submitted Claim 001/subsequent
updates and within the Contractor's detailed response, comments and argument (attached to reference

Yours faithfully,
