Subject:Re: EOT & Prolongation Costs Assessment
Dear Sir,

Further to your letter referenced (4) above, which is in response to our letter reference (3), we hereby
set out our response accordingly.
Contrary to your opinion, we firmly believe that our aforementioned letter is very clear as to why certain
costs have been omitted as there is simply no evidence and justification to prove otherwise. We would
like to remind you that prolongation costs do not typically include task related costs, one off costs
and/or overhead costs. If we have used statements such “...further proof is required…” or “…you must
provide evidence to demonstrate…”, it is because you have submitted such costs without further
evidence and justification to say why they should be considered. As you have the burden of proof, you
must suitably demonstrate why such uncharacteristic costs should form part of the prolongation claim.
Therefore until sufficient evidence and justification have been provided to the contrary, we maintain our
position against the costs heads in question.
Notwithstanding the above, we would be happy to have a meeting to discuss this matter further and
provide any necessary clarifications. Please make contact with our commercial representative to
arrange a suitable time and place to meet.
Yours faithfully,
