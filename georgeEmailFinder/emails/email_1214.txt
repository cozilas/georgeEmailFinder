Subject Substantiation of 'TCA JV' Claim
Dear Sir,
Further to Engineer's correspondence referenced above, we are obligated to record that we have not
yet received a formal response to the previously requested outstanding detailed particulars,
substantiation and clarification of the Contractor's claim as referenced in the Heads of Agreement (HOA)
dated 5th March 2015.
This has been the subject of various weekly meetings and correspondence between all concerned
parties, including the Engineer, but not limited to, our letters referenced above. Thus we reiterate our
request for further detailed particulars and substantiation contained within the above referenced
correspondence.
Clearly if such information is not supplied, this will inevitably prejudice the Engineer's opportunity to
investigate and take appropriate action in accordance with the timescales established within the Heads
of Agreement dated 05 March 2015, with associated consequences to the Contractor.
In view of the above and all previous correspondence on this matter, we urge the Contractor to work
with the Engineer to ensure all appropriate and necessary information is provided, in order for the
Engineer to be able to make his determination prior to October 2015 (as per the HOA).
Yours faithfully,
