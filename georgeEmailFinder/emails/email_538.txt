Subject:

Unauthorized ceiling removal and damages by the Employer’s Subcontractor

Dear Sir,
With reference to the above subject, this is to inform you that the Employer’s Subcontractor M/S
Comba, working for the installation of Etisalat cables on site, has removed the ceilings as shown in the
enclosed photos without any authorisation or prior notification at CP L1.0 room-128. Such actions are
totally unacceptable and must be avoided to ensure the smooth progression of the works.
Moreover, please be informed that while carrying out this act, a ceiling tile has been damaged as shown
in the enclosed photos. We also note that this is a serious safety hazard and your immediate action to
prevent future occurrence of such activities, is required.
Kindly note that any requirement of tile removal or opening in ceilings needs to be formalised through
us and to be attended by the respective Subcontractor, in this case M/S Cloisall accordingly.
In view of the above, we reserve our rights under the Contract pursuant to Sub-Clause 27.1 (Contractor’s
Claims) in the event of any delay and/or cost impact arising from the above described event.
Yours faithfully,
