Subject: Outstanding Payment to Sub-Subcontractor
Dear Sir,
We have received under cover of AECOM Transmittal Advice Form MTC-CMA-TCA-0401-TML-01448
dated 181
h March 2015, detailed particulars from the Employer Representative pertaining to alleged
non-payment by you to your 2nd tier suppliers for goods manufactured and delivered to the Project.
This issue is highly embarrassing as the notification has come directly from the Employer. The
information that has been made available to us is that your main suppliers of ductwork have now
ceased production until such time as payment is made. For ease of reference we have been advised
that;
1. Rapid Cool have no Gl Ducts in manufacture for the MTB Project as they are
awaiting payment from PCEJV
2. BK Gulf has not manufactured any Gl Ductwork for the project for 3 weeks due to
late Â·payments from PCEJV.
3. China State have not manufactured any Gl Ductwork for the MTB Project for 3
months and are awaiting a AED 5,000,000.00 Payment
4. Noor AI Yemen are no longer prepared to supply Gl Ductwork to the MTB Project
due to consistent late payments by PCEJV
5. Gulf Ducts are no longer prepared to supply Gl Ductwork to the MTB Project due to
consistent late payments from PCEJV
6. Seagull are currently supplying Fire Rated Ductwork to the MTB Project but have
raised concerns/ issues with regards to the outstanding payments due from PCEJV
7. EFECO are the only company currently manufacturing & delivering Gl Duct to the
MTB Project.
The aforementioned is completely unacceptable. You have previously been advised under cover of
letter MTB/TCA/PCEJV/L/001189 dated 22nd Feb 2015 that such actions will not be tolerated and that
there are mechanisms within the contract to deal with the same. For ease of reference we once again
would make reference to the following Clause 21.3 of the Sub-Contract Agreement between PCEJV &
TCAJV in that;
Yours faithfully,
