Mustafa,
Apologies for the delay, but we have been exceptionally busy and overwhelmed with requests for
notices and other assistance during recent weeks and we are doing our best to try and manage the
requirements of everyone.
As mentioned in my email below, we have prioritized your request and it will be completed and issued
to you soon.
Yours faithfully,
