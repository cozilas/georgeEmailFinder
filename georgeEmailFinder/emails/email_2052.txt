Dear Sir,

Further to the direction of reference 1) issued pursuant to General Condition (“GC”) 13.2.1 of Volume 3
of the Contract, the Contractor hereby notifies the Engineer’s Assistant that said direction requires
further modification as follows.

In particular, Clause 14.3.4.3.b.iii) of Volume 6 of the Contract states that the Telecom Safety Police
room shall be “located next to the Tel/IT Main Room”. The Contractor has developed its general
arrangement designs in accordance with this clause and in-line with the equivalent requirement set
forth in the MSI contract (as demonstrated via the ICF of attachment 1).

By swapping the Telecom Safety Police Room with the Tel/IT Third Parties Room, the former will no
longer be located next to the Tel/IT Main Room. The Contractor therefore kindly requests the direction
of reference 1) to be revised accordingly by incorporating the deletion of Clause 14.3.4.3.b.iii) of Volume
6 of the Contract.

Following receipt of the revised direction the Contractor shall then proceed with its 13.2.1 valuation. We
remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.
Yours faithfully,
