Subject: Warranties
Dear Sir,
As you are aware, the Specifications forming part of the Subcontract require you to issue Warranties for
the benefit of the Employer and ourselves on express terms and for a specified period of time in respect
of the materials, equipment and plant supplied, installed or supplied and installed by you for the
Permanent Subcontract Works under your Subcontract.

To be specific, we request that you submit the Warranties within seven (7) days from receipt of this
letter. Further, to ensure the Warranties we submit to the Employer are in full compliance with the Main
Contract, we have developed standard warranty forms that comply with the Main Contract. These have
been submitted to and agreed with the Engineer and ADAC.
We hereby attach the link for the final form of warranties to be granted by Sub-contractors, Installers,
Suppliers and Manufacturers for each product I equipment:

1. The submitted Warranties should be fully compliant and consistent with the requirements of the
Sub Contract.
2. The submitted Warranties are required to comply with the note (1 to 5) contained at the end of the
enclosed warranty.
3. You are not permitted to make any amendments to the Warranty forms or to add any additional
comments on the signatory pages.
4. You are not permitted to add any standard warranty terms of your company.
5. You are to return the fully completed and executed Warranty to us (4 Original Signed Certificates
from each form), via the attached transmittal document.
6. Failure to sign the Warranty may result in rejection of materials, plant or equipment that have been
accepted thus far as approved Material Approval Request since such approval was conditional on a
Warranty being provided in a format that meets the conditions of the Main Contract to the Engineer's
satisfaction.
Yours faithfully,
