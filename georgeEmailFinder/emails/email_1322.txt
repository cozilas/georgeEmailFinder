It has been noted that no action appears to have been taken to date regarding the use of Refrigerants
containing zero ozone depleting potential despite the issuance of an Engineers Instruction No. 9 (Ref.
MTCCMATCA-0401-L TR-00163) dated 30 December, 2012. The compliance to the aforementioned Instruction
is still not being fulfilled. CMA still observed newly purchased air-conditioning units stocked at TCA JV
Store
yard and there were several units which had been installed and operated in various facilities.
Dear Sir:
we refer to your letter ref. MTBfTCAIAECOMfU000401 dated 14 April2013 In respect of the above.
We would remind you that the contents of your letter should form part of the fully detailed claim

(42)
days after the Contractor became aware (or should have been aware) of the event or circumstance
giving rise
to the claim. In consideration that the actual date of the event or circumstance has not been fully
identified, but

by applying the date of your notification of 10 February 2013, the fully detailed claim was due to be
submitted
before 24 March 2013, however at the date of this letter, 24 April2013, your claim remains
unsubstantiated.
We would remind you that you have also failed to comply with SubÂ·Ciauses 27.1.3, 27.1.4, 27.1.5(b) and
27.1.6.
In consideration of your non-compliance with the requirements of the Contract and, for the reasons
stated in
our letter ref. MTC-CMA-TCA-0401-LTR-00320 dated 18 March 2013, we again advise that your Claim
No.
C/Cost/0005 is hereby rejected.
Yours faithfully,
