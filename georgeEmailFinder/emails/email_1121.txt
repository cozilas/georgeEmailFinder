Subject: Notice of Delay- Screed and Stone Installation Progress at CP
Dear Sir,
We refer to above mentioned subject matter and record your persistent failure in completion of
aforesaid works in a timely manner as required and our concern over ongoing Site delays caused by you
due to low progress on site activities.
We record that, your progress of stone installation and screed works shall not achieve the targeted and
planned
quantum of installations. We note that your lack of progress is mainly grounded to your improper
supervision from
your part on the works. Although total area of 16,546 m2 at CP L3.0 is released for screed, only 10,810
m2 is

casted and only 967m2 of stone installation is completed as of August 19, 2017.
In the light of above, you are hereby reminded of your obligations as set out under the Subcontract
Clause 16.6.1,
if you fail to comply with approved Subcontract Programme, you shall indemnify and hold us harmless
against all
damages, costs losses and expenses incurred by us in connection of your delays. Moreover, Subcontract
Clause
16.6.2 provides that "( ... ) if the Subcontractor fails to comply with Clause 16.2, the Subcontractor shaJJ,
subject to
Clause 10.3, pay delay damages to the Contractor for this default." Therefore, you are required to take
immediate
action to recover from the current delay and achieve the planned progress as earliest.
This is for your utmost attention and further necessary action.
Yours faithfully,
