Subject:Update No. 1 to E-Notice No. 0250
Impact of UAE Government Edicts in relation to COVID-19 (Coronavirus)

Extended Disinfection Programme and Travel Restrictions and the Continued Delaying and
Disruptive Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Project
Dear Sirs,
We refer to various letters issued to you and the Employer including without limitation letters ref: (1) to
(4) associated with the impact that the UAE Authorities’ edicts associated with the COVID-19 Pandemic
is having on the Project, and in particular our E-Notice No. 250 issued vide letter ref: (4).
By way of reminder, our letters ref: (3) and (4) in particular provided an initial assessment of some of the
implications that this delaying and disruptive event is having on various elements of the Project, as well
as provided an overview of some of the letters we have so far received from subcontractors.
With this in mind, we herewith attach further interim particulars by way of Annex A hereto that serves
to record some of the salient content of additional letters we have received from a combination of the
same subcontractors cited in letters ref: (1) and (2), as well as other affected subcontractors.
We believe the content of Annex A to be self-explanatory: it is evident that the various UAE Authorities’
edicts issued to date and the on-gong situation associated with the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic
generally, is continuing to have a sustained major detrimental impact on our subcontractors’ ability to
progress their works; hence this continues to severely delay and disrupt the MTB Project as a whole.
We will continue to provide periodic updates and notify you accordingly, but in the meantime, reaffirm
our entitlement to both additional time and payment that we will seek to recover under the Contract
and/or at law due to the various events and circumstances described in letters ref: (1) to (4) and above
plus Annex A. As advised in letter ref: (4), whilst confirming these circumstances represent a Variation,
given the imperative of implication of these new rules, we will not enforce the prior agreement to cost
and time clauses agreed within SAA8 but will proceed on the basis of Contract Clause 20.6.
Yours faithfully,
