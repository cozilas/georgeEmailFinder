Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to letter reference 1), whereby the Engineer's Assistant requests to include certain
design items in the landscape design cost as referenced in letter 5). The Contractor will be addressing
these items under a separate cover since they are issue of a separate Engineer's Instruction, letter
reference 2).

Furthermore the Contractor would like to reiterate its concern in respect to the potential impact on the
GSAS Certification, as expressed in letter reference 6).

Yours faithfully,
