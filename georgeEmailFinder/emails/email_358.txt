Subject: Delay Notification- LET Installation and Commissioning Worl<s
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to your letters ref (1) and ref (2), in which you notify us of our purported
lack of progress and a failure to meet the completion date as per Baseline Rev 11.2 Programme, for
the LET Works.
We refute your allegation with respect to a lack of progress and confirm Pier 4, Pier 3 and Pier 1 are
completed, Pier 2 is in progress. In addition, during the Hotel & Office C&E, LET readiness has been
demonstrated functionally, but not documented due to unavailability of permanent power.
There was no negative impact during the recent ORAT trials, with everything operating as planned.
All the tested units are certified by a third party and operated successfully.
Currently, separate resources are deployed specifically to expedite the energization of the LET, the
effects of which will be rea lized from the 3rd week of July.
Contrary to your statement that we have demonstrated a lack of progress and are in delay, the entire
122 escalators, all 58 moving walkways and 161 out of 163 elevators are installed and operating at
normal speed following a successful ORAT trial. This clearly demonstrates a concerted and fully
focused effort to progress the works.
The majority of snagging items are either related to documentation and/or already installed and
completed works. There a few outstanding issues and comments related to operation/functionality
ofthe units which are being actioned.
We are targeting to deploy 10 additional snagging teams to assist closing the outstanding installation
comments. Pier 4 snagging inspections are in process and a completion schedule is being prepared.
In any event, we remind you that under cover of our letter (3), we have demonstrated our
entitlement to extensions of time for 5 of the 7 number of SAA8 Milestones as follows:
We are confident that when, in due course, the appropriate extensions of time are granted by you,
we will be able to demonstrate that the matter that you refer to has not caused a critical delay to any
of the Milestones.
We conclude by reiterating that we remain fully committed to ADAC, the Project and to completing
our obligations within the shortest possible time, without compromising on safety and quality, but

will noi. be held responsible for such factors as those outlined above for which we are not culpable.
Yours faithfully
