Subject: Request for Engineer's Instruction [RFEI/0401/0686]
Dear Sir,
Deflector 'Back-Pan' Flashing at Bottom ACP for Water/Sand Protection
The Contractor refers to its Request for a Variation Order No. 1511 {1} in respect of the Consultant's
direction that a deflector 'back-pan' flashing is added at the bottom of the aluminium composite panels
(ACP}.
Please note that neither the typical Tender/IFC section details of the roof edge panels indicate any
'backpan'
flashings to the ACP cladding nor does Specification 074101 identify such requirement; however,
during the shop drawing review process, the Consultant directed the Contractor to add the said 'backpan'
flashings to avoid accumulation of both sand and water. The Contractor further notes that, it was only
when the deflector 'back-pan' flashings were incorporated to the subsequent revision of the abovelisted
shop drawings that the Consultant assigned a code-2 to these submissions enabling the Contractor to
proceep with the works.
The Contractor confirms that early notice was given to the Engineer that these works constitute a
Variation to the Contract and, moreover, the issuance of a formal Variation Order has already been
requested (1}; yet, the Engineer's assessment of the Contractor's entitlement has not materialised to
date. The Contractor requests therefore that the Engineer reviews the information provided and
confirms

that the deflector 'back-pan' flashing shall be installed via an Engineer's Instruction pursuant to Clause
20.1.1{a) of the Conditions of Contract to enable the Contractor to proceed with the additional works.
Yours faithfully
