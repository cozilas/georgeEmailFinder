Subject: Subsidence- scope of Works and design responsibility
Dear Sirs,
We are concerned that certain members of your Team appear to be no longer aware of the scope
and relevant responsibilities of the Parties in respect of the subsidence remedial Works.
In respect of scope, we would refer you to the above noted Specification at 1.1 A. and 1.3 C.
where it is clearly stated that the objective of the method of remediation' you have chosen and
instructed is to "increase stiffness and strength of the ground immediately beneath the manholes
and connec;ting pipes" (our emphasis). If remediatior is expected anywh~re other than with ir;~

these very clear parameters then instruction is specifically required to be issued.
In respect of design responsibility we would remind all parties that we are required by the
Contract, inter alia to carry out remediation works upon being instructed to do so by the
Engineer. The incorrect wording in the Specification is overridden by this fundamental allocation
of risk under the Contract.
We are not therefore responsible in Â·any way other than to carry out works to the agreed
methodology and wording such as that at Specification clauses 1.1 B., F., and G is t herefore of no
relevance to our Works and deemed deleted. For the avoidance of any further doubt
a. We carry out Works as instructed and not as stated in 1.1 B. 'to meet the acceptance
criteria';
b. Similarly we are not responsible to 'ensure t hat the specified improvement of t he ground
beneath the sewer system is achieved' contrary to 1.1 F.;
c. Likewise, the design life of our Works stated at 1.1 G. is not ed, but we carry no
responsibility beyond materia ls and workmanship in meeting such a criterion.
Please ensure that the above is made clear in order that no further time is wasted in uncertainty
and fruitless dialogue.
Yours faithfully,
