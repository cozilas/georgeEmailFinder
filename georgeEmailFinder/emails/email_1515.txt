The Engineer's Assistant refers to Contractor's letter referenced at item (1) above.

It is not clear from the Contractor's letter which station(s) you are referring to, but the Engineer's

The Engineer's Assistant confirms that the Contractor's design should comply with the Employer's
Requirements and in particular Volume 6 Sections 1.4.16.3, 1.4.17.3 and 1.4.17.4.

As previously discussed in the SAP workshops any future developments in the vicinity of Qatar National
Muse Station will be restricted to two stories in height and therefore the loading provisions in the above
rerenced sections of the Employers Requiremenls wHJ cater for this

Yours faithfully,
