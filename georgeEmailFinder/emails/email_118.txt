Subject:Post SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0235
Changes Introduced to the VESDA panels located Inside the CP Staircase 05/41 Level 3.0 –
Request for Engineer’s Instruction (EI) / Variation Order (VO)
Dear Sirs,
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
The event detailed in Annex A hereto, represents a change in design and scope and requires a valid EI
and VO in order for us to integrate the same into the Works.

Potential Impact
Delay and disruption due to the events and circumstances outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
likely to impact on the achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within seven (7) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
Background
On 14 March 2017 we raised RFI/0401/13453 Rev. 00, requesting clarification from you / Employer’s
Design Consultant (KPF) of the following design coordination issues concerning the ‘Air Aspiration Pipe
Connection to Utility Walls’, primarily relating to the exposed pipework connecting to the air aspiration
panels located inside the utility walls to Level L2.0 (our question reproduced in Figure 1 refers).
Figure 1 – RFI/0401/13453 Rev. 00 (Question)
On 15 April 2017 you responded to RFI/0401/13453 Rev. 00 in the manner shown in Figure 2:

This E-Notice No. 0235
Thereafter, on 1 May 2019 we raised RFI/0401/17079 Rev. 00, requesting clarification from you and/or
the Employer’s Design Consultant (KPF) of the following matter in relation to the installation of the Very
Early Smoke Detection Apparatus (VESDA) panels located above the ceiling inside the refuge area of CP
staircase 05/41 landing at Level L3.0, in the manner shown in Figure 3 below.
Figure 3 – RFI/0401/17079 Rev. 00
RFI/0401/17079 Rev. 00, was issued consequent on your response to RFI/0401/13453 Rev. 00, which
failed to resolve the issue appropriately and therefore left the matter pending. This was due to the fact
that not only did there exist deficiencies in the IFC Design but also you failed to provide a resolution to
the issue which simply related to clashes / obstructions between existing ductwork i.e. Heating,
ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and the VESDA panels to be installed in the same area.
Appended to RFI/0401/17079 Rev. 00, were a series of attachments:
•
A plan layout of the concerned location (reproduced in Figure 4 below);
Figure 4
•
3D sketches indicating the area where the VESDA panels would be installed, demonstrating that
the location where VESDA panels would be installed is occupied / clashing with the HVAC shaft. The
various 3D sketches attached thereto are partially reproduced in Figure 5 below:
Figure 5

•
Photographs showing the location where the VESDA panels would be installed and the HVAC
ductwork obstructions in the concerned location (refer to Figure 6 below):
Figure 6
At its simplest, RFI/0401/17079 Rev. 00 pointed out the clashes, the actual site conditions and the latest
BIM coordination, showing that there is insufficient space to accommodate the VESDA panels. In which
respect we provided two options therein (reflected in Figure 3 above), which could be utilised and could
provide a resolution to this matter and requested you to clarify and advise accordingly.
We requested a response to RFI/0401/17079 Rev. 00 by 7 May 2019. However, you failed to reply until
26 calendar days later on 2 June 2019. Notwithstanding the prolonged period in responding, the
Employer’s Design Consultant (KFP) advised the following (reproduced in Figure 7):
Figure 7
Moreover, the Employer’s Fire Safety Consultant (Profire) also responded to RFI/0401/17079 Rev. 00, in
the manner shown in Figure 8 below:
Figure 8
Not only did KPF’s and Profire’s responses to RFI/0401/17079 Rev. 00 fail to provide any resolution to
the matter but we were asked to provide another proposal in regards to overcoming the obstructions
and the installation of the VESDA panels. In this regard, we reiterate once again that we are not the
designers for this Project, the Employer’s Design Consultant is. Consequently, we accept no liability or
responsibility for any inconsistencies in the Design; neither do we accept any responsibility for
overcoming any inconsistencies in the Design; this remains with the Employer’s Design Consultant.
The facts remain as follows: We proceeded with the installation of the VESDA panels at the stability
core wall (external side). Notwithstanding the fact that you failed to provide a suitable Design and/or a
design solution to the matter, after the completion of the installation of the VESDA panels to the
stability core wall (external side), you then subsequently requested us to conceal / cover the VESDA
panels so that they are not visible to the public. In which respect we reinforce the fact that the Design,
IFC Drawings and approved Shop Drawings, do not indicate any concealment / coverage of the VESDA
panels and consequently this represents a defector variation and change to our scope of Works.
In this regard, SAA8 laid down strict guidelines to follow if additional works are required and therefore
the aforementioned change will warrant a valid Engineer’s Instruction (EI) and a Variation Order (VO) if
you require us to proceed with integrating the revised scope into the Works.
We therefore, take this opportunity in also reminding you of the provisions of Clauses 2.29 to 2.31 of
Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’) pertaining to Variations, in so far as we are not to
proceed with any Variation unless a Variation Order and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. In
which respect, it is your obligation to issue this Record first if you wish to instigate change; this is only
after the additional time and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.
Meanwhile, until such time as you take the action required of you in accordance with SAA8 Clause 2.29,
we are unable to proceed with implementing the changes noted above and will continue to proceed in
accordance with the existing IFC Design to the extent we are able to.
Finally we note that since this issue has not been appropriately addressed and resolved by you and the
Employer’s Design Consultant, despite RFI/0401/13453 Rev. 00 having been raised and responded to
prior the Effective Date included in SAA8 (4 September 2018), this matter cannot possibly be construed
as being deemed to be included within the ‘Contractor’s Settled Claims’ (SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.7.2) and
‘Included Circumstances’ (per SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.7.4). That said kindly note that the effects of delay
associated with this matter will nevertheless be analysed from 4 September 2018 onwards.
Yours faithfully,
