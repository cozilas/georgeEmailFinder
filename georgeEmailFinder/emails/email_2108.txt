Dear Sir,

We refer to letter ref. M006-LBE-COM-LTR-01162 in which Qatar Rail issued a Direction under SubClause
13.2.1 for the Contractor to submit a quotation for a variation proposed by the Engineer.

The requested information was due for submission on 26 August 2015. You are requested to submit the
requested information without further delay.
Dear Sir,
The Engineer's Assistant refers to item 2 above whereby the Contractor was required to provide a more
thorough estimate. The Contractor is required to submit an estimate with the potential scope
requirements including Provisional Sum works. Specifically it has been noted previously:

1.
Contractor is required to consider and submit additional cost estimates associated with design
work for the MEP and Architectural Finishes.

2.
Contractor is required to consider and submit additional cost estimates associated with bo.th
MEP and Architectural Finishes work. Although these specific estimates would be within a provisional
sum contract scope, the Engineer's Assistance requires reasona_ble estimates, broken down into several
activities, with qualifications and I or contingency factors (such as a percentage allowance) due to the
lack of detailed design information. It is assumed Contractor should be able to provide such a
breakdown and assessment based on the drawing information provided with item 1 referenced above.
