Subject:Request for Confirmation of Variation Order Pursuant to COC Sub-Clause 20.1.4 (b) for
RFI/0401/7837 – Sound Absorbing Panels Build-Up Discrepancy
Dear Sir,
With reference to the Engineer’s response to RFI reference: (1) above, please be advised that the
information, comments, clarifications and/or instructions (the Instruction) contained therein constitute
an instruction of a Variation.
The Instruction requires, No objection to Contractor’s proposal to satisfy the specified 2-hr fire
resistance rating. Product detailed description as specified in section 098413, (clause 2.1), does not
achieve the required acoustic and fire rating performance. Consequently, in order to achieve the
required acoustic and fire rating performance, the following panel build-up is proposed:
•
2mm perforated steel sheet
•
2 x 75mm Rockwool insulation thickness
•
2mm perforated steel sheet
In light of the above, we consider that, the Instruction contains a Variation that is not in the form of, or
which has not been confirmed in writing by the Engineer by way of, a formal Variation Order.
In accordance with Sub-Clause 20.1.4 (b) of the Conditions of Contract, please provide a formal
confirmation of Variation or issue an Engineer’s instruction and revised Drawings and/or Specification
pursuant to Sub-Clauses 11.3.3 and 20.1.1 (a), within seven (7) days of the receipt of this letter.
Unless and until the Engineer takes this required action, in accordance with Sub-Clause 20.1.5 of the
Conditions of Contract, the Contractor would not be able to proceed with the implementation of the
above described Variation.
Yours faithfully,
