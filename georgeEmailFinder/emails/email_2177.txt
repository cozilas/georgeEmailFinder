Dear Sir,
The Engineer's Assistant (EA) refers to your letter at reference 2) above.

EA notes the content of your letter stating that the "design has been developed on the basis of the
Engineer's Instruction, and issued to the market as part of the MEP packages the Employer will gain the
full benefit associated with this Instruction". However this conflicts with Claim Number 47 referenced 1),
where additionaldesign costs are being pursued.

The Engineer's Assistant reminds the Contractor of its obligation under sub-clause 13.2,which includes;
(a)

a detailed scope of the Variation (including any drawings or technical details);

(b)

a detailed breakdown of the price for which the Contractor would carry out the Variation

It is for th Contractor to determine the method by which it is to comply, for which Contractor has 14
days. The Contr ctor's quotation should be forthcoming without further delay.

Yours faithfully,
