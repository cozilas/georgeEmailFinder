Dear Sir,

The Engineer's Assistant refers to letter reference 1), wherein the Contractor was directed to submit a
quotation for any cost or time impact. Following issue of further information under reference 2), the
Contractor was reminded to issue quotation by reference 3) and 4). Although the Contractor failed to
respond, Engineer's Instruction reference 5) was issued confirming the provisions of 13.2.1 still applied.

The Engineer's Assistant considers that the clarifications within Contractor's letter 6), responded to
under letter reference 7) are no grounds for the lack of quotation over a period exceeding some 6
months. The last reminder, reference 8), was due by 14 September 2016.

Absent compliance with the Engineer's direction and later Instruction, the Engineer is now compelled to
complete he assessment of this Variation without input from the Contractor.

Yours faithfully,
