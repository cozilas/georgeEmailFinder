SUBJECT RE: CONTRACTORS CLAIM SUMMARY OF CONTRA CHARGES
Dear Sir,
With reference to the above Letter Reference No #1, and subsequent to receipt of M/s. TCAJV's Letter
Reference No #2, M/s. Cloisall write to notify the following pertaining to details contained within the
Charge submission from M/s. TCAJV.
M/s. Cloisall accepted/agreed the majority of the contra charge, however we do wish to raise our
concerns/disagreement on the back charge reference TCAJV-BC-03654 imposed upon us.
It has been agreed with TCAJV's representative (Mr. Siva), for M/s. Cloisall to supply Aluminium
cladding materials to M/s. Mill Fabrication and that the related installation cost as per our Contract
Agreement will be back charge (Refer enclosed e-mail correspondence).
M/s. TCAJV has issued the installation cost which we refute/reject amounting AED 287,700.00 and
refer to the enclosed calculation of cost based on our contract agreement which amounts to an
installation cost of AED 26,502.66 (Enclosed evaluation/RFVO, drawing and agreed rate breakdown).
M/s. Cloisall request the JV to review and correct the imposed charges in the next IPC. Trust the

aforementioned suffice, however should you have any further information related to the matter,
please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned
Yours faithfully,
