Subject:Clause 27.1.1: Notice of Claim – Delay Notice No. 254 [post-SAA8]
ADM Inspection Delay (COVID-19)
Dear Sirs,
We refer to our Delay Notice No. 0254 issued by way of letter ref: (1), notifying you of our entitlement
to additional time and payment due to the “no show” on the part of CMA and Profire QC Inspectors to
attend the WIR inspection scheduled on 2 April 2020 as a consequence of coronavirus (COVID-19)
related issues.
It has since come to our attention that the ADM inspections of the Plumbing Installations that were due
to take place this week are also affected. Specifically, we have come to know that the ADM and AECOM
inspectors have been advised to be tested for the coronavirus owing to suspicion as to their exposure to
the virus. We believe that until such time as the results become available, they are all self-quarantining.
The failure of ADM and AECOM inspectors to attend the site constitutes acts of prevention and/or
breaches of Contract on the part of the Employer/Employer’s Personnel and/or Consultants, and as such
we give you notice, pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1, of our right to
claim:
(i)
An extension to the Time for Completion pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c); and
(ii)
An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.1 pursuant to Clause 9.10, or,
in the alternative, damages for breach of contract.
Interim and/or final details of the Time Impacts and adjustments to the Contract Price relating to this
event will be provided in due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.5(a), (b) and (c).
Finally, in order to avoid a potential reoccurrence of the above on the part of AECOM inspectors, can
you kindly advise the inspectors’ working arrangements going forward so that we can plan accordingly.
Yours faithfully,
