Subject: Subcontractor's Payments to Sub-Subcontractors
Dear Sir,
Clause 21 .3.3 of the Conditions of Subcontract provides that:
"Before issuing any Interim Payment Certificate the Contractor and/or the Contractor may demand
from the Subcontractor reasonable evidence that all previous amounts paid to the Subcontractor
in respect of costs claimed by the Subcontractor as being due to Sub-subcontractors and/or
suppliers (less any retentions) have been paid by the Subcontractor. If the Contractor has not
received such reasonable evidence within three (3) Days of such a request, the Contractor may
(at its sole discretion) either:
(a) withhold such amounts from any further payment due to the Subcontractor; or
(b) pay such amount (or any part of such amount) directly to the relevant Sub-subcontractors
and/or suppliers on behalf of the Subcontractor and recover such amount from the Subcontractor
by deducting and setting-off such amount from any future payment due to the Subcontractor.".
We require you to issue a completed "Financial Disclosure Schedule" (FDS) with each
subsequent month Interim Payment Application (IPA). For example, your IPA for period ending
July 2014 shall include a FDS for April2014; and August IPA a FDS for May 2014 etc.
As we are required under the main Contract to disclose proof of payment to you and by you to
your supply chain before the Employer releases payment to us, your timely submission of the
monthly FDS will ensure prompt payment to us both.
Accordingly, we hereby request you to submit to us, within three (3) Days of receipt if this letter,
the completed Financial Disclosure Schedule for the cumulate position at 31 March 2014 showing the
amounts that were paid to you and the amounts that were paid to your suppliers and
subcontractors which should be certified by your auditor as a true record.
We have previously under cover of Letter Reference already requested full Financial Disclosure
regarding the status of Certificates and Outstanding and/or late payments to
Also you are once again reminded to issue with each monthly payment application going forward a
Financial Disclosure Schedule (FDS). For example, your IPA for period ending July 2014 shall include a
FDS for April2014; and August IPA a FDS for May 2014 etc. The issue may be compounded in case you
fail to provide the same and will be discovered in any project audit which could result in late payment
and/or penalties issued by the Employer.
Yours faithfully,
