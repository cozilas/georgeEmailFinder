Canopy Works Package - Delays to Procurement Activities

Dear Sir,
In reference to our site meeting (4th October 2018), whereby you advised our Construction Team you
are yet to commence procurement of the outstanding materials for the canopy works; we hereby
formally place on record our concern regarding your ability to progress the Subcontract works
expeditiously and therefore achieve the completion dates as set out in the agreed construction schedule
(enclosed).
We take this opportunity to remind you of your obligations as set out under the Subcontract - Clause
8.1.2 [Subcontractors Obligations]. Moreover, Subcontract Clause 16.1.1 [Commencement of

Subcontract Works] provides that you are obliged to progress the Subcontract Works with due
expedition and without delay, and should neither delay nor adversely affect the performance of TCAJV
or other subcontractors.
In view of the above, you are hereby instructed pursuant to Clause 11.3 [Instructions of the Contractor]
to submit an Action Plan within three (3) days from the receipt of this letter, detailing your proposed
mitigation measures concerning the procurement of all outstanding materials for the canopy works. In
addition to the above, the action plan should detail proposed manpower levels (histogram) and working
arrangements (extended working hours etc), highlighting your commitment to achieve the agreed
completion dates.
We have attached a template procurement delivery schedule; the information within the schedule
should be updated on a weekly basis and issued to our Procurement and Construction Teams along with
substantiation demonstrating that procurement, fabrication and delivery is proceeding.
Please note that any delays, costs, losses and/or expenses incurred by us and/or Other Subcontractor/s
arising as a result of the incurred delays shall be at your risk and recovered from your account in
accordance with the Subcontract clauses 10.3[Contractorâ€™s Claims], 16.6.1 [Delay Damages] and other
relevant clauses.
This is for your immediate action and attention.

Yours faithfully,
