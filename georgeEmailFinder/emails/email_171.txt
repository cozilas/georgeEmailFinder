Engineer's Response to RFI/0401/17385 – Introduction of Power Assistance to Hollow Metal Doors
Reference Nos. 88-T-B20-0124.01 and 88-T-B20-0124.02 – Request for Engineer’s Instruction (RFEI) /
Variation Order (VO)
Dear Sir,
We refer to your letter ref: (1) following issuance of E-Notice No. 0178 (ref: 2) in which you aver inter
alia that as the event was a known even prior to the effective date of SAA8 there is no entitlement to
any additional time and / or cost, and our request for an Engineer’s Instruction is rejected.
For the reasons comprehensively set out in Annex A to letter (2) we disagree; and it is clearly evident
you have elected to ignore the content of our notice and/or missed the crux of the issue entirely.
The facts of the matter remain as follows:
•
On 21 August 2019, we raised RFI/0401/17385 requesting clarification as to whether two doors,
i.e. Doors ‘88-T-B20-0124.01’ and ‘88-T-B20-0124.02’ require power assistance or not.
•
You took 9 calendar days longer than the reply required by date stipulated therein to respond.
•
Attached to the response to RFI/0401/17385 was a sketch, prepared by KPF, consisting of a
partial extract of a revised Door Schedule, changing the specific provision of power supplies for Doors
‘88-T-B20-0124.01’ and ‘88-T-B20-0124.02’ from ‘Not Required (“N”)’ to ‘Required (“Y”)’.
•
It is clear that the response to RFI/0401/17385 represents an attempt to vary the existing design
and scope of Works; hence why we requested an Engineer’s Instruction / Variation Order from you
seeking formal confirmation of the change. This is on the basis that SAA8 laid down express guidelines
for you to follow if any changes are required to be implemented into the Works.
Hence this does not fall under the provisions of SAA8 Clause 2.24.2.1, as alluded to by you nor can it be
construed as such. Moreover, the provisions of Clause 1.7.4 ‘Included Circumstances’ do not apply
either as your response to the other RFI cited in our letter ref: (2) failed to address our original query.
In view of this, then we maintain all our rights under the provision of Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses
16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to the Time
for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event described in letter ref: (2).
Yours faithfully,
