Cloisall Disruption Claim -Wall Cladding

Dear Sir,
We refer to your ‘Consolidated Extension of Time, Prolongation Cost & Disruption Cost Submission’
made via letter reference CLO/0401/MTB-CEILING/CONT/11377/17 dated 08 October 2017 and in
particular to your claim for ‘Ceiling Disruption Cost’ in the amount of AED 3,398,952.
The claim comprises two elements, viz, ‘Labour Disruption’ in the amount of AED 2,663,352 and ‘Design
Disruption’ in the amount of AED 735,600.
Labour Disruption
You claim AED 2,663,352 as the additional cost of deploying third party labour in lieu of your own
directly employed labour over the period 27 February 2016 to 30 June 2017 inclusive i.e. in the period
beyond the original date for completion set down in Schedule 1 of the Subcontract.
A claim for Disruption however seeks to address loss of productivity in the execution of particular work
activities that arises from events for which the party against whom the claim is made is culpable. Your
claim cannot therefore be regarded and/or assessed as a Disruption claim as it neither relates to nor
mentions loss of productivity.
Notwithstanding the categorisation of this element of your submission, we have noted the following:
(i)
You have provided at Page 12,827 of the submission, a unit rate breakdown for Cloisall Skilled
Labour (Carpenter, Ceiling Fixer, Mason) of AED 13.08 per hour (for a Work Day of 10 hours).The
calculation is based, inter alia on 302 Work Days per year and as such seemingly includes for the Friday
of each week. According to UAE Labour Law however, the Friday of each week is ordinarily a mandatory
rest day; this being the case, then the number of Work Days is significantly less than the 302 that you
have used. Furthermore, the UAE Labour Law also provides that the first 2 hours of overtime (beyond
the normal 8 hours each day) is paid at the normal rate plus 25%, whereas the rate for your overtime
hours includes for an uplift of only approximately 11%. Using your per annum cost of AED 30,884, 281
Work Days per year and an uplift of 25% for the overtime hours, we calculate the rate for a 10 hour
Work Day as AED 144.25 per Work Day / AED 14.43 per hour [see Fig. 1].
A rate of AED 14.43 in lieu of AED 13.08 per hour for directly employed Skilled Labour would reduce the
alleged deficit between the cost of deploying directly employed and third party labour by approximately
AED 780,000.
(ii)
The rate of AED 14.43 per hour for directly employed Skilled Labour includes an allowance of
AED 44.84 per Work Day (AED 4.484 per hour) for Food, Accommodation and Transport (FAT) and as
such is less than the AED 5.00 per hour that you have added to the rates for EPIC and Najmat in your

valuation (Page 12,826). A rate of AED 4.484 in lieu of AED 5.00 per hour for FAT would further reduce
the alleged deficit by approximately AED 16,000.
(iii)
Amounts for FAT are also included in your claim for Prolongation (indirect time-related) Cost.
The recovery of FAT via the unit rates must accordingly be considered in the assessment of the
Prolongation Cost in order to eradicate any ‘double dipping’.
(iv)
The hours used in your valuation are derived from the ‘Manpower Subcons Summary Report –
27 Feb 2016 to 30 Jun 2017’ included in the submission at Pages 12,836 to 12,851 (the “Report”) which
for each day identifies the number of men provided by each third party labour supplier. Your claim
assumes that each person was deployed in the works for 10 hours each day. Your submission however
also includes at Pages 12,852 to 12,928 certain timesheets in which the actual hours for each person
each day are recorded by each supplier (the “Timesheets”). There is a difference of 58,014 hours
between the hours derived from the Report and those for which Timesheets are provided [see Fig 2].
(v)
Neither the Report nor the Timesheets evidence the activities on which the resources were
deployed and/or that the resources were reasonably and effectively deployed.
(vi)
You have valued the third party labour using the hours derived from the Report multiplied by
the rates in the orders (and in the case of Transguard have used an unweighted average rate); you have
not adduced any evidence of actual cost incurred.
(vii)
You have not complied with the provisions of the contract regarding sub-subcontracting and/or
the timely notification and valuation of claims.
Design Disruption
You claim AED 735,600 as the costs of Design Manager and CAD in preparing and submitting 1,226 Nr.
Shop Drawings which you allege were additional to the 1,704 Nr. Shop Drawings contemplated by the
Subcontract “due to various changes and lack of proper coordination by the Contractor”.

You have provided a Shop Drawing Log at Pages 12,929 to 12,939 of your submission, from which it
seems that you have considered all drawing revisions after R00 as additional (not contemplated) and
only necessary due to the occurrence of events for which we are culpable under the Subcontract to pay
you an additional consideration. For each additional drawing you claim additional resource time (2 hours
for the Design Manager and 6 hours for the CAD Operator / Draughtsman) that you value at the AED
150.00 and AED 50.00 per hour respectively. Again, this element of your claim neither relates to nor
mentions loss of productivity and as such cannot be regarded and/ or assessed as a Disruption claim.
Notwithstanding the categorisation of this element of your submission, we have noted the following:
(i)

You have not identified the cause for each additional shop drawing for which you seek payment.

(ii)
You have not adduced any substantiation of the resource time you allege was reasonably
required for each additional drawing and/or of the rates used in your valuation of that time.

(iii)
Amounts for design resources are also included in your claim for Prolongation (indirect timerelated) Cost and in your claim for Wall Cladding Disruption and for Gatehouses Disruption. All claims
must therefore be collectively considered in order to eradicate any ‘double dipping’.
The claims that you seek to make via this submission are not disruption claims and moreover are
deficient in several aspects. Pending your submission of the full and detailed particulars necessary to
evidence the entitlement you assert against us and of the amounts claimed, we assess the value of your
submitted claim as Nil.
Yours faithfully,
