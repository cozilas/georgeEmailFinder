Dear Sir

We are writing with reference to the above referenced letter regarding the water backlog difficulties
being experienced on your site and that you state may have been caused by the aquifer experienced on
site of Souq Waqif station. The Gold Line Joint Venture (JV) responds with the following comments.

•
The UCC project (tunnel and shafts) is closer to the sea and shallower than Doha Souq Station
and the cavities encountered are very common in Simsima Limestone, especially in areas close to sea.
Cavities in Simsima Limestone are water-bearing and if inter-connected, a lot of water is to be expected.
It is evident from the attached Bauer report that you are experiencing difficulties in the higher level due
to cavities and boulders.
•
Our excavation is semi-closed box because piles and grouting have been installed and as our
excavation is deeper, our dewatering will play a positive role to the UCC excavation. The drawdown will
decrease the water head on your site.
•
The water incident in artesian form was approx. at -25.0 m in the Rus Formation (the lower
aquifer) after penetrating the Midra Shale which confirms that the two incidents are completely
separate.
•
Our water problem has completely different nature and background compared to UCC water
problem.

The above points clearly demonstrate that there can be no possible relationship between the aquifer at
the Souq Waqif Station and the dewatering problems you have encountered.

Yours faithfully,
