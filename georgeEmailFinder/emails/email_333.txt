Subject: China State Acceleration Claim- Information Outstanding Update
Dear Sir,
In response to your letter reference (2), wherein you stated that "we do not identify any new
substantiation which has not been previously submitted" CSCEC has submitted new information in
January 2018 in relation to their Acceleration Cost Claim.
Please find attached the following additional information provided by CSCEC in support of their claim
with
further clarifications;
• Attachment 1 - A list of additional documents (attendance sheets, pay-slips, access ID cards)
CSCEC provided in recent submissions (which arrived in early January 2018, Appendix 1 to 3 with
summary page of clarifications).
• Attachment 2 - Minutes of meeting ("MoM") with CSCEC's added comments, which was a
clarification meeting between TCA-JV, AECOM and CSCEC held on 26th November 2017 @ 3pm in
AECOM's Office.
• Attachment 3 -File Index List {63 total files) also requested by AECOM in the same MoM above.
• Attachment 4 - CSCEC Service Agreements (SZRT & Omniscient Technical Services L.L.C. &
Interface Technical Inspection ITI) and CSCEC's LPO (Local Purchase Order)- Aries Oil Field Services
L.L.C.
CSCEC has also clarified their response to your letter (2) above; these responses were previously
tabulated
to you in our letter (1) above, with supporting particulars (by way of Appendix 1 to 5 of said letter). We
hereby add further clarifications to that letter (1) above;
1. Our submission of (1) above contained copies of the translated English version of CSCEC's labour
agreements.
2. Our submission of (1) above contained an additional CSCEC calculation to derive the number of
additional labour related to accommodation and other labour welfare expenses.
3. Our submission of (1) above contained CSCEC's quotations provided for the steel scrap materials
from 3 separate scrap dealers.

4. Our submission of (1) above contained CSCEC's schedule of quantities demonstrating the
materials distributed to each fabricator and their design locations.
5. Our submission of (1) above contained CSCEC's updated and additional information and
supporting documents provided by Tiger Steel (the fabricator I subcontractor) in relation to their
acceleration of the fabrication works. The Contractor reiterates that the Subcontractor CSCEC has
provided further and all the clarifications and
supporting particulars requested on various occasions by the Engineer; moreover, the Subcontractor
CSCEC has also responded to every query raised by the Engineer between May 2017 and December
2017
in relation to the Heads of Claim of the Acceleration Costs.
The Contractor emphasises once again that, despite numerous reminders, the Contractor is yet to
receive
the Engineer's formal assessment in respect of the Subcontractor's CSCEC Acceleration Cost Claim.
The Contractor is still of the opinion that the Engineer has been furnished with sufficient information
(and
additional supplementary information) to enable his assessment of the Subcontractor's CSCEC Cost
Claim;
therefore, the Contractor feels prudent to remind the Engineer once again that whenever provision is
made in the Contract for the giving of any determination, such determination shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.
Pursuant to the provisions of the Conditions of Contract Clause 11.4.1, please determine the matter
fairly
and in accordance with the Contract.
Yours faithfully,
