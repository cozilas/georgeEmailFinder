Delays to Subsidence Rectification Works (Grout and Excavation Works) – Delayed Receipt of
MTA Contractor’s As-Built Drawings
Dear Sir
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and/or circumstances described in Annex
A may cause delay and/or disruption to the Works and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
The matters described in Annex A concern delays to completion of the Works due to your failure to
provide the MTA Contractor’s As-Built Drawings showing levels and locations of existing services.
Potential Impact
Any requirement for additional works, such as that outlined herein and at this stage of the Project, is
likely to impact on the achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Kindly ensure that such matters are actioned within seven (7) days of receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
*** We note that the content of some of the e-mails quoted in Table 2 to letter (ref: 1), incorrectly
mentions the accuracy of the MTA Contractor’s ‘as-built drawings’ when in fact they should have
referred to the MTA Contractor’s ‘shop drawings’.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
We refer to various letters issued by us in connection with the subsidence rectification works such as
letters ref: (1) to (4) cited above, that amongst other thing, notified you of delays consequent on soil
rectification works and in particular the works that are outside the zone of influence of the sewers.
Letter ref: (4) for example cites eleven subsidence related EIs/Bulletins defining the scope of works.
This included inter alia Engineer’s Instruction No. 775A (Bulletin 261.1) associated with the ‘soil
Rectification Works for Pier 1’ (refer to item 1 of Table 1 below) received on 31 July 2019. Following

which, we have since received an additional seven (7) Engineer’s Instructions / Bulletins for additional
soil rectification works (grouting and excavation works) (refer to items 2 to 8 of in Table 1 below).

However, following a review of the multiple ‘For Construction’ Drawings appended to each of above
referenced EIs / Bulletins, we found that that we were effectively being directed to either grout or
excavate around the MTA Contractor’s existing underground services; yet the EIs (Bulletins) failed to
include any corresponding as-built MTA services drawings information for each of the affected areas.
This caused us to issue a series of e-mails including but not necessarily limited to the e-mails listed in
Table 2 below, requesting the provision of CAD drawings defining the location of as-built utilities.

Be noted that we commenced yesterday the requested CPT
points on pier 1. CPT-P1-R025 reached 1m with Qc=80MPa, as per attached layout, the position of CPT is
clash free, But we are not confidant with other contractor as-built drawings. Be noted that TCAJV will
not hold any responsibility for any potential damage that might occurs because of an-accurate as built
drawings of other contractors utilities.
We still waiting CMA confirmation about the accuracy of other contractor as-built drawings (refer to
attached ). we waiting your confirmation and direction to get moving with Pier 1 CPT points.”

“Please be noted that we started verifying the required grouting
works/points on pier 2. We notice that the received as-built drawing through attached e-mail for MTA

contractor doesn’t contain any coordinates and levels for existing MTA utilities which we will not be able
to verify the grout points and confirm if its clash free or not. We kindly keep seeking CMA/Engineer
verification and confirmation on other contractors works and as-built in order to avoid any potential
damages that might occurs due to the miss-information or un-accurate as-built drawings.
We kindly request CMA/Engineer to check and supply us with all of verified and accurate as-built
drawings related other contractor works. The required drawings shall contain the setting outs and the
actual installation level for all MTA utilities.”

“Following e mail from Rafat below [item … above], please note
that as of today, we still didn’t received verified data which will able us to proceed with grouting clash
free study for pier 1.
Please note the LNT work is massive around pier 1 and without knowing the levels of pipes the study is
not possible.
This is bringing us to the concerns about providing grouting point study for pier1 to site on time and
appropriate accuracy.”

“Referring to the attached e-mail and the discussed held during
weekly subsidence meeting (Monday 07/10/19), we still waiting your feedback about MTA as-built
drawings. We are not able to verify the grout work which located along other contractor works without
having a clear as-built drawings contain the actual installation levels and position from other contractor
works.
Delaying issuing the as-built of other contractors works are delaying us of verifying the required grout
works and issuing the required shop drawings for approval and commence the site works as well.
Appreciate your cooperation and quick response with providing all of the required information/as-built
drawings to allow us checking/verifying and issue the required shop drawings for grout works.”
The information recorded in Table 2 above, demonstrates successive requests for us to be provided with
essential as-built drawing information pertaining to the coordinates and levels of existing MTA utilities
and our inability verify the grout points and confirm whether the areas and works in question are clash
free or otherwise absent receipt of such information. However, despite our requests, at the date of
preparing this E-Notice which is 15 October 2019, this information remains outstanding.
As noted, the delayed receipt of the MTA Contractor’s As-Built Drawings information in support of the
coordinates and levels of existing MTA utilities is preventing us from verifying the required works and
preventing us issuing all necessary Shop Drawings to you prior to commencing the works on site. We
therefore urge you to insist that the MTA Contractor provides this without further undue delay.
Yours faithfully,
