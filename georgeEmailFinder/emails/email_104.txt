Rejection of Non-Conformance Reports – Flood Damage
Dear Sirs,
We refer to your letter ref: (1) issued in response to our letter ref: (2) in which we outlined our reasons
for rejecting all seven Non-Conformance Reports (NCR) ref: (4) to (10) relating to ‘Flood Damage’.
For the reasons set out in our letter ref: (3) we refute that we are in any way responsible for the flooding
and our position recorded therein as well as recorded in our subsequent letter ref: (2) remains
unchanged.
While acknowledging our obligations to comply with the provisions of Conditions of Contract Clause
12.1, for the reasons explained previously this sub-clause is not relevant to the flood incident: we refute
that we are in any way responsible for the flooding and by the same token, given that the works, plant
and equipment subject to all seven NCRs has been installed in accordance with the requirements of the
Contract and signed off through the WIR process; they cannot be construed as being defective or not fit
for the purpose for which they are intended as alleged by you.
While writing we also draw attention to the fact that despite issuing numerous Requests for Approval to
you, the Employer and the Loss Adjuster, vide a series of successive e-mails issued since 10 March 2020
(copies attached), seeking approval of the various remedial works cited therein, you and the Employer
have failed to reply. We therefore urge you / the Employer to respond and provide your acceptance [or
otherwise] without further undue delay.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve our right to recover the related delays and associated additional costs
due to the act of prevention on your part and the part of the Employer to instruct and direct us
accordingly.
Yours faithfully,
