Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to the Engineer's Instruction ("El") Nr 87 at reference 1 (received by the
Contractor on 02 November 2015) which has been issued as a Variation Instruction pursuant to General
Condition ("GC")
13.1.1 of Volume 3 of the Contract.

The Contractor is of the opinion that this Engineer's Variation Instruction may provide the Contractor
with entitlement for additional payment for the resulting varied Works as an addition to the Contract
Price pursuant to GC 13.6.1 and may provide the Contractor with entitlement to receive extension(s) to
the affected Time(s) for Completion pursuant to GC 8.4.1(a) for any delays consequently incurred due
to executing the varied Works.

Accordingly, the Contractor hereby notifies the Engineer's Assistant of the Contractor's intention to
claim for its possible entitlement (1) for additional payment due to El Nr 87 (notification pursuant to GC
20.1.2) and,
(2) for any extens ions to the affected Time(s) for Completion for any delays that may be incurred due to
El Nr 87 (notification pursuant to GC 8.4.2 and GC 20.1.2).

Please rest assured however that notwithstanding the above, the Contractor will endeavour, in
accordance with its contractual obligations, to mitigate any delays and additional costs incurred due to
El Nr 87.
Yours faithfully,
