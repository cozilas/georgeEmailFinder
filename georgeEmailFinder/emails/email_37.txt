Dears,
Further to our numerous email correspondences ref: (1) above, we are writing to inform you that we
shall be moving out of our rental unit office no.2901 Concord Tower, on Saturday 12 September 2020 at
7pm.
As a result, this letter serves as a written notice that we will be permanently vacating the
aforementioned premises where our office is located and therefore request for an early termination of
our lease that commenced on 15 December 2019 and expires on 14 December 2020.
As a result, we kindly request that you schedule a walk-through inspection on Sunday 13 September
2020 or any day within the following week so we can prepare and submit, the required documents
mentioned in the handover form of the contract.
In conclusion, since we have not been able to reach a settlement and have exhausted all means of
communication, we inform you that we will be filing an official complaint with the Rent Disputes
Settlement Centre in Dubai.
We trust the above clarifies the matter.
Should the need arise for any further clarification on the matter, kindly do not hesitate to contact us.
Yours faithfully,
