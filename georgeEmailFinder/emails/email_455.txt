Subject: Employer's Notice of Claim number 9 by letter 0279 dated 12 March 2019
Dear Sirs,
We thank you for the opportunity today to conduct an inspection of the PQC apron with you and
your various representatives. The meeting was convened in order for them and for you to make out
your case as to where and how our activities have caused the level of damage that is alleged.
We must record that nothing you showed us or explained to us changes our view that the vast
majority of the issues facing you stem for poor workmanship and quality control during the original
construction of the apron areas.
Whilst we continue to accept that there is minor insignificant damage resulting from our use of the
PQC, we have made in our above noted letter what we still consider to be a generous offer of AED 3
million in full and final settlement of all and any liability on our part for such damage.
Our offer was made on a without prejudice basis in an effort to settle this matter and to allow us to
move a limited amount of welfare facility onto a small part of the apron. As each we:ek has passed
and we have not been able to relocate, the utility to us in our offer is reduced. We re:gret therefore
that our offer is hereby withdrawn and we will revert to some form of dispute resolution process in
order to clear the Notice of Claim issued under Contract Clause 10.3.
Yours faithfully,
