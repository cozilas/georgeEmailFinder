Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
On 9 September 2019, we submitted RFI/0401/17445 Rev. 00 requesting confirmation of the setting-out
/ coordinates of the external S10 lighting located at L0.0 Sectors 7.14, 5.11, 5.26, 5.34:
“Please refer to the attached sketches for the External S10 lighting setting-out in L0.0-External. Please
note that the plants arrangement is as per BP58. Please Confirm”
The attachments to RFI/0401/17445 Rev. 00 consisted of the following:
1)
Four (4) IFC Drawings consisting of the IFC A-94 Drawings showing the general arrangement plan
and the indicative location of the external S10 lighting fixtures, positioned along the landscape
perimeter of the landscape on the edge of the planters at Level 0.0 Sectors 7.14, 5.11, 5.26, 5.34;
2)
Five (5) Briefing Pack 58 (BP-58) sketches annotated as ‘Internal Planter Soft Landscape’ ande
enumerated as ‘ASK 00024’, ‘ASK 00025’, ‘ASK 00026’, ‘ASK 00032’ and ‘ASK 00033’;
3)
One (1) approved Shop Drawing No: 401-AN-E-07-GE-0.00-LT-SD-124; and
4)
Two (2) sketches annotated as ‘North S10 light setting out’ and ‘South S10 light setting out’
proposing/providing the exact setting-out/coordinates of the external S10 lights.
As recoded in RFI/0401/17445 Rev. 00 (reproduced above), the arrangement of trees and plants shown
in the Drawings/Sketches appended thereto, were according to BP-58, reflective of the location,
quantity and type of the new plant layout to the ‘Hard and Soft Landscape L0.0 arrivals’ area (Figure 1
refers). We note however that there is no reference made to, nor are any details provided in BP-58

[according to the sketches provided thereto], with respect to the setting-out/coordinates of the external
S10 lights.

In the same manner, the exact setting-out/coordinates of the external S10 lights, were similarly not
shown on any of the IFC Drawings. Specifically, the IFC A-94 series Drawings, attached to
RFI/0401/17445 Rev. 00, only show indicative locations, where the S10 external lights will be installed
along the perimeter of the landscape on the edge of the planters as shown in Figure 2 below.

In addition to the above, our approved Shop Drawing No 401-AN-E-07-GE-0.00-LT-SD-124 was submitted
following the IFC A-94 Drawings, where the S10 lights are placed along the perimeter of the landscape
on the edge of the planters (Figure 3 refers). We further record also that Shop Drawing No 401-AN-E07-GE-0.00-LT-SD-124 was returned by you classified as approved with Status Code 2 comments.

As noted above, RFI/0401/17445 Rev. 00 was raised to confirm the final setting-out/coordinates of the
S10 lighting fixtures, wherein we attached thereto two sketches enumerated as ‘South S10 light setting
out’ and ‘North S10 light setting out’, in the manner shown in Figures 4 & 5 below (Figures 4 & 5 are a
partial extract of the sketches), providing exact coordinates for the S10 Lighting Fixtures. These
coordinates have been based on the planting layout. With RFI/0401/17445 Rev. 00 we requested your
confirmation and approval of the coordinates/setting-out of the S10 Lighting Fixtures respectively.

We requested a response to RFI/0401/17445-00 by 19 September 2019. However, you failed to reply
until 48 calendar days later on 6 November 2019, wherein the Employer’s Design Consultant (KPF)
simply stated the following:
“External Light (S10) to be coordinated w/external landscaping design related to BP58. Therefore,
AECOM landscape to review and respond”
While the Employer’s Design Consultant (Landscaping) commented in the manner reproduced in Figure
6 below:
Figure 6 – Employer’s Design Consultant (Landscaping) Response to RFI/0401/17445 Rev. 00
Notably the Employer’s Design Consultant (Landscaping) comments/response to RFI/0401/17445 Rev.
00 (Figure 6 refers), failed to address the very matter which the RFI was raised for in the first place; and
that is the provision and/or confirmation of the setting-out/coordinates of the S10 Lighting Fixtures. In
lieu however, the Employer’s Design Consultant’s (Landscaping) response simply advised us to:
1)
Install the underground ducting/conduits for the future provision of the S10 Lighting Fixtures;
2)
It then directs us, to simply hold the installation of the S10 Lighting Fixtures until “…the
landscape has been developed…”, in essence asserting that only then it will “…be more practical to
assess, install (if required) and aim the light fixtures to the associated feature landscape items…”;

3)
The response continues to advise us that “In terms of sequence of works, typically the landscape
should be installed prior to the lighting, hence the recommendation above.”
Not only did the Employer’s Design Consultant (Landscaping) failed to address the matter requested of
it; i.e. confirmation of the setting-out/coordinates of the S10 Lighting Fixtures, but it is arguable that the
Employer’s Design Consultant (Landscaping) is essentially requesting that the works of the installation of
the S10 Lighting Fixtures is to be placed on hold until the placement of plants and trees to the landscape
area. This is unacceptable particularly at this stage of the Project. We therefore, strongly advise that
the works for the installation of the S10 Lighting fixtures can and should continue without any further
delay.
What is also concerning is the Employer’s Design Consultant (Landscaping) statement as seen in item 2
above which reads as follows
“…Once the landscape has then been developed, it will then be more practical to assess, install (if
required) and aim the light fixtures to the associated feature landscape items (Feature mounds / small
shrubs etc. etc.”, [bold added and underlined for emphasis]
The abovementioned Employer’s Design Consultant (Landscaping) statement appears to put to question
the installation and or even the provision of the S10 Light Fixtures to the landscape. In this regard we
put on record that all S10 Light Fixtures have been approved as per MS/0401/E/0310 Rev. 00, and have
already been procured, delivered to the site and are ultimately only pending installation. In addition,
attached to your response was an email sent from the Employer (ADAC) to you (the Engineer) dated 31
October 2019 [Thursday 9:12 AM]. The email is reproduced in Figure 7 below:
Figure 7 – 31 October 2019 [Thursday 9:12 AM]
After reviewing the email shown above and attached to your RFI/0401/17445 Rev. 00, it appears that
there is an internal discussion between yourselves and ADAC, discussing about what is possibly a change
of the “…light fitting types…”. The email continues to record “…that the S10 lights are already delivered
to the project and awaiting installation…”. It also requests you to “…inform the landscape designer to
review the setting-out requirement as per their [the Designer’s] revised landscape design in BP-58”.
The RFI/0401/17445-00 responses concludes with your (the Engineer) comments stating that:
“Refer to landscape consultant’s response above and to the Client email under the “Supporting
Documents”.”
Subsequent to the receipt of your response to RFI/0401/17445 Rev. 00 discussed above, on 12
December 2019 we received from you by way of a revised (Rev. 01) response to RFI/0401/17445, where
your (the Engineer) comments had been revised. We note that your revised (Rev. 01) response to
RFI/0401/17445 01 on 12 December 2019, is some 84 calendar days late, from the date this RFI was
required to be responded. Both of the RFI responses are summarised in Table 1 below.

Notably, your revised comment referred us to the attached CD thereto, providing the requested
coordinates of the S10 Lighting Fixtures. Your revised comment is reproduced in Figure 8 below.
Figure 8
Notably, via revision 01 of RFI/0401/17445, you provided the coordinates/setting-out of the S10 lighting
fixtures, as per our request. However, upon investigation we have identified that the S10 lighting
fixtures are to be relocated and distributed inside the landscape/planters area rather than on the edge

of the planters, as discussed above and as indicated in the IFC A-94 Drawings (Figure 2 refers) and also in
the approved shopdrawing ref 401-AN-E-07-GE-0.00-LT-SD-124 (Figure 3 refers). For comparison
purposes, Figures 4 and 5 (‘South S10 light setting out’ & ‘North S10 light setting out’) shown above are
repeated below, along with the sketches attached to your RFI/0401/17445-01 response, enumerated as
‘Reference RFI-17445 (Revised Response) Lighting Fixtures Type-S10 Coordinates SOUTH LANDSCAPE
AREA’ and ‘Reference RFI-17445 (Revised Response) Lighting Fixtures Type-S10 Coordinates NORTH
LANDSCAPE AREA’, which are also reproduced (partly) below in Figures 9 and 10. We note that a full
scale of all four sketches which have been reproduced in Figures 4, 5, 9 and are attached to Annex B for
ease of reference.
According to the sketches (Figure 9 and Figure 10) attached to your revised response to
RFI/0401/17445-01, the S10 lighting fixtures have been relocated inside the landscape/planters’ area
nearby the trees and plants etc. as mentioned above. We reiterate that as per the IFC A-94 series
Drawings and the approved Shop Drawing, the S10 Lighting Fixtures were indicated along the perimeter
of the landscape on the edge of the planters, as shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5, and most certainly not
inside the area of the landscape/planters as per your RFI/0401/17445-01 response. In this regard, we
also inform you that all the S10 Lighting Fixtures have already been procured, fabricated and delivered
to site together with the 1.5 metre cable and the attached IP (Ingress Protection) gland. Moreover, the
installation of the conduits and pull boxes to the perimeter of the planters, has also been completed on
site (Figure 11 refers).
Figure 11
The already installed conduits (200m) and cables (1500m) are highlighted in Figure 12 below (yellow
lines) which is showing the cable laying route. Based on the coordinates provided as per your comments
to RFI/0401/17445-01, the plants and trees are located far from the provided points and most of them
will face cable shortage in length.
Figure 12
It is for this reason that we write to you, as the setting-out/coordinates proposed by you, essentially
seek to introduce changes to the scope of our Works according to the current IFC Drawings, the
approved Shop Drawing and the BP-58 sketches.
It is clear therefore that the sketches annotated on RFI/0401/17445-01 providing the proposed settingout/coordinates of the South/North S10 Lighting Fixtures located at the L0.0 landscape area are an
attempt to vary the design and will require a valid Engineer’s Instruction (EI) and a Variation Order (VO).
Such changes will include inter alia the following, involving coordination of numerous subcontractors:
•
Since the installation of the conduits and pull-boxes to the planters’ perimeter have already
been completed on site, the changes introduced via RFI/0401/17445-01 may result in having to remove
the already installed containments and boxes accordingly, depending on your requirements. In which
respect, these changes would consist of either:
1) Removal of the already installed containment and relocate them to the desired location as per your
request/instruction. This means that there will be abortive works and we will have to remove all the
already installed containments (200m) and cabling (1500m) and start again from scratch; or
2) All containments to remain at the existing location, but then we will have to procure new extended
manufacturer cables together with the IP rated connectors and IP rated pull boxes. In the event that it is
required to extend the cables and install them underground, this would require re-excavation of the
completed/compacted soil to place the extended cables and proceed with all required backfill works;

•
Please note that all S10 Lighting Fixtures have been procured and delivered to the site and
cannot be modified since they are factory-made. We put on record that any possible modification will
compromise the IP rating and the warranty accordingly;
•
We note once again that the relevant Shop Drawing has already been approved showing the
installation of the conduits, pull-boxes and S10 lights placed at the edge and adjacent to the edge of the
planters, respectively. Therefore any changes will require the relevant drawings to be revised to show
the newly introduced IP connectors and junction boxes;
It is also worth mentioning that as per the comments of the Abu Dhabi Distribution Company (ADDC)
during the site inspection (Form 4 inspections) that took place in August 2018, ADDC confirmed that the
junction boxes are required to be fixed on the edge of the planters only. This means that we are not
proceed with placement of any junction boxes and run electrical conduits in the middle of the planters.
We have attached to Annex B and also reproduced in Figure 13 below, the relevant email sent from
ADAC to us dated Wed 08-May-19 [12:54 PM]. Specifically, ADAC has clearly stated among others that
“…no boxes shall be installed in the middle of the planters to avoid any mechanical damages risk […]
2.Planter boxes shall not be installed in the middle of planter, only on the side walls…”.
Figure 13
Therefore, we are of the opinion that if the junction boxes and electrical conduits are installed in the
middle of the planters/landscape, it is highly unlikely that this will be approved by the Authority Having
Jurisdiction (AHJ) / House of Expertise (HOE).
In summary therefore, we write to inform you that the revised locations of the S10 Lighting Fixtures, will
result in substantial changes to our scope of Works. SAA8 laid down mandatory procedures to be
followed if additional works are required, and you have failed to follow these; an EI and VO are needed
for us to proceed with the aforementioned changes.
We therefore, take this opportunity in also reminding you of the provisions of Clauses 2.29 to 2.31 of
Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’) pertaining to Variations, in so far as we are not to
proceed with any Variation unless a Variation Order and a Time/Cost Record have been issued first. In
which respect, it is your obligation to issue this Record first if you wish to instigate change; this is only
after the additional time and/or costs impacts have been agreed between us beforehand.
Meanwhile, until such time as you take the action required of you in accordance with SAA8 Clause 2.29,
we are unable to proceed with implementing the changes noted above and will continue to proceed in
accordance with the existing IFC design to the extent we are able to.
Yours faithfully,
