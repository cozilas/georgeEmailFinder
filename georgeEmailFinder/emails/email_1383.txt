Dear Sirs,

Further to the Contractor's fully detailed initial interim Claim Nr 024 submission issued under cover of
reference 12 and the Contractor's subsequent monthly updates of same issued via references 2, 4 , 6
and 8, the Contractor confirms, in accordance with General Condition ("GC") 20.1.6(b) of Volume 3 of
the Contract, that the following updated additional costs in relation to Claim Nr 024 have been incurred
by the Contractor over the past month. Accordingly, the Contractor provides this February 2016 monthly
update to Claim Nr 024.

The Contractor confirms that no additional cost information from others in relation to Claim 024 has
been received over the past month.

Since the October 2015 Claim update, the Contractor has been incurring financing costs and overheads
and profit "(OHP") upon same, as no payment has been made to date.

The finance costs, from 30 October 2015 to 29 February 2016 (122 days), are calculated as fol lows:

((OAR 1,270,642.00 (Contractor's Direct Costs) + OAR 1,385,610 .00 (Lead Designer's revised FCN 082 .2
claim) + OAR 345 ,313.00 (OHP)) x 122/365 Days x 4.25% (finance rate) = OAR 42,639.00.

OHP upon this additional finance cost are: OAR 42,639.00 x 13% (OHP rate) = OAR 5,543.00. Therefore,
total finance costs and OHP upon same to date are calculated as follows:
OAR 42,639 .00 (finance costs from 30 October 2015 to 29 February 2016) + OAR 5,543.00 (OHP upon
finance
costs from 30 October 2015 to 29 February 2016) = OAR 48, 182.00.

This provides a February 2016 updated Financial Summary for Claim 024 as follows:

The Contractor will advise upon any time impact issues within subsequent Claim 024 updates.

As the event giving rise to this Claim has a continuing effect and the Contractor is still collating further
particulars, the Contractor shall be submitting further interim Claim submissions with respect to the
event giving rise to Claim Nr 024 at monthly intervals as required by GC 20 .1.6(b).

The Contractor again (i.e. further to reference 2) takes this opportunity to completely refute the
Engineer's Assistant's "Response to General Principles" of Claim 24 made within paragraphs 6 and 7 of
reference 9 and re-iterated within references 1, 3, 5 and 7 which, the Contractor notes, have been made
without any authority (back-up/reasoned argument) being provided within references 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9. The
Contractor shall respond in more detail on these points under separate cover.

Yours faithfully,
