Dear Sir,
We write this Notice further to the above list of correspondences and following receipt of the enclosed

As you will note, the Engineer reiterates our concerns with regards to the management of the
procurement process and the quality of your installation personnel (see enclosed letter MTC-CMA-TCA0401-LTR-10568 – dated 7th April 2019). In the enclosed correspondence the Engineer cites the above
factors as the primary cause of the delays incurred to date. Your failure to manage the above is
unacceptable. We therefore instruct you to respond to this letter within seven (7) days of receipt,
detailing your Action Plan with intended mitigation measures in order to recover the aforementioned
delays and achieve the completion of all outstanding works within the limited timeframe remaining.

Subcontract clauses 10.3, and 16.6.1 in addition to other relevant Subcontract Clauses.
This is for your information and immediate action.
Yours faithfully,
