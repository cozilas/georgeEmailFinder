Subject:Engineer’s Delays – SCRs’ Energization in CP and Pier 2
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to your letter (1) in which you allege that we have delayed the SCRs’
energization activities in the CP and Pier 2 locations.
We refute your allegations and refer you to the delays we have suffered resulting from late approval of
our Form 4 submissions, which is outside of control and the MTA Contractor’s (L&T) late completion in
those locations.
We have proactively engaged in interface meetings with L&T, however L&T’s late completion in those
areas has impacted us heavily.
However, facing all of these third-party delaying matters, we confirm that through our significant efforts
and close site supervision, all SCRs’ were energized by 28 March 2019.
We acknowledge the wiring rectification and MEP works works which have run in parallel with the
delays of and L&T works in CP GHs and the dysfunctional Form 4 submissions approval process.
We conclude by reiterating that we remain fully committed to ADAC, the Project and to completing our
obligations within the shortest possible time, without compromising on safety and quality, but will not
be held responsible for such factors as those outlined above for which we are not culpable.
Yours faithfully,
