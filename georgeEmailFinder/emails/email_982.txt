Subject: Progress of Prl Works- Notice of Delay (IV)
Dear Sir,
Further to the Contractor's delay notices referenced above and issued in respect of the Prl lack of
progress, the Contractor reiterates its concerns in relation to the Subcontractor's continuous lack of
performance.
For example, the Contractor records the Subcontractor's inability to undertake site measurements,
procure and deliver the required flashings for the Prl. As of the date of this correspondence, the
Subcontractor fabricated the same pressing four times being in every instance unsuitable for
installation;
this cannot be understood by the Contractor. Be reminded that the Contractor should be able to rely
upon
the Subcontractor's professional expertise, skill, care and judgement in relation to all matters
concerning
the execution of the Subcontract Works; hence, the Subcontractor continuously and repeatedly failing
to
monitor and correct its fabrication process is simply not acceptable.
The Contractor takes this opportunity to remind the Subcontractor that the control sample should have
been completed by 15 December 2017 and yet three months after the actual completion date for this
benchmark remains unknown.
The Contractor reiterates that its rights under the provisions of Clause 10.3 [Contractor's Claims] and
Clause 16.6 [Delay Damages] of the Conditions of Subcontract are reserved.
Yours faithfully,
