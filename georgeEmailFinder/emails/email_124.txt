Subject:Overdue Payment from ADAC
Dear Sirs,
We write with reference to the delayed release of recent Payment Certificates and more significantly,
the current overdue payment from the Employer for Works that were undertaken in November 2019.
The information recorded in Table 1 below sets out when our last three Payment Applications were
submitted to you, when the corresponding Payment Certificates were to have been issued by you, when

they were actually issued, and when the corresponding Payment were or are to be made by the
Employer. This also shows the net amount that is currently due and payable by the Employer.

This shows that Payment Certificates for our Payment Applications dated 11 December 2019 and 12
January 2020 were issued up to 41 calendar days late. This also shows that at the date of writing, your
Payment Certificate for our Payment Application dated 6 February 2020 is 24 calendars days late.
Of particular concern is that fact that our current Payment (i.e. for Works done in November 2019), in
the sum of AED 17,251,538 is currently overdue by 12 calendar days (i.e. as at 29 March 2020).
This represents a breach of the General Conditions of Contract, per Schedule 11 (Payment Terms).
Accordingly, we remind you that pursuant to Clause 5 (Interim Payments), Sub-Clause 5.3 states that:
‘Within twenty-eight (28) Days of the Engineer receiving a Statement and supporting documentation
from the Contractor, the Engineer shall:
(a)
proceed in accordance with clause 11.4 (Determinations) to agree or determine the amount of
the interim payment to which the Contractor is entitled;
(b)
record such amount in an Interim Payment Certificate and
(c)
issue such Interim Payment Certificate to the Contractor and the Employer.’
While according to Clause 6 (Timing of Payments), the Employer shall pay to the Contractor
‘… the amount which is properly invoiced and due to the Contractor in respect of each Interim Payment
Certificate …. on or before … twenty-eight (28) Days from the date on which the Employer received the
relevant invoice from the Contractor …’
As such the November payment is effectively some 53 days overdue and the December payment some
10 days overdue.
Notwithstanding that according to Clause 7 (Delayed Payment) we are entitled to claim interest on the
amounts due but unpaid at the rate specified in Schedule 1 we hold the Employer in breach of Contract.
We trust the foregoing is remedied forthwith and besides urging you to release the overdue Payment
Certificate for Works undertaken in January 2020 without any further delay, by copy of this letter to the
Employer, urge the immediate release of our outstanding payment in the sum of AED 17,251,538.
Yours faithfully,
