Subject:Clause 27.1.1: Notice of Claim – Delay Notice No. 0029 [Post SAA8]
Overdue Review of MEP Shop Drawings [31 October 2018] – Update
Dear Sir
This letter serves as an update to E-Notice No. 0029 issued by way of our letter ref: (1).
By way of reminder: our letter ref: (1) notified you of potential delays consequent upon your belated
responses to a total of 773 Shop Drawings detailed on the pdf summaries attached thereto; namely:
1.
Schedule 1 consisted on 196 nos. of ‘Plumbing Mechanical Shop Drawings; and
2.
Schedule 2 consisted of 577 nos. of ‘Open Electrical Shop Drawings’.
Specifically, we recorded that at or around the date our notice was prepared (31 October 2018), you
exceeded the review periods expressly stipulated within Article 1.3 of Specification Section 013300
‘Submittal Procedures’ for the majority the noted submittals; hence the issuance of our E-Notice.
We have since reviewed each of the same Shop Drawings [773] and accompanying Submittals [276] that
were subject to E-Notice No. 0029 and herewith attach an update of the status of the various
Mechanical, Electrical, PAVA, Fire Alarm, and Fire Protection Shop Drawings at Annex A and B hereto.
Annex B represents a comprehensive list of ‘Full Details of Overdue Responses to MPE Shop Drawing
Submittals subject to EN-0029, updated to 29 May 2019’; while Annex B provides a ‘Summary of
Overdue Responses to Shop Drawing Submittals subject to EN-0029, updated to 29 May 2019.
However, Annexes A and B shows that you actually exceeded the review periods expressly stipulated in
the Contract in relation to 243 out of the 276 Submittals, by periods of up to 151 calendar days.
In conclusion therefore, it is clear that any ‘lateness’ in responding to our Shop Drawing Submittals
constitutes an act of prevention and/or breach of Contract and accordingly, we hereby give you notice
pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 of our right to claim:
(i)
An extension to the Time for Completion pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.5.1(c); and
(ii)
An adjustment to the Contract Price in accordance with Clause 21.1 pursuant to Clause 9.10, or,
in the alternative, damages for breach of contract.
Interim and/or final details of the time impacts and adjustments to the Contract Price relating to this
event will be provided in due course pursuant to Conditions of Contract Sub-Clause 27.1.5(a), (b) and (c).
Yours faithfully,
