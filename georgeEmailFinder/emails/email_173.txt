Engineer’s Responses to RFI/0401/17445 Rev. 00 and Rev. 01 – Changes to External S10 Lights SettingOut / Coordinates located at Landscape / Planters Area L0.0 – Request for Engineer’s Instruction (EI) /
Variation Order (VO)
Dear Sirs,
We refer to your letter ref: (1) following issuance of E-Notice No. 0187 (ref: 2) in which you aver that we
are somehow culpable for the matters detailed in our letter ref: (2), and that [pursuant to SAA8 Clause
2.24.2.1] the “Contractor … has no entitlement to any additional time and / or cost”
For the reasons comprehensively set out in Annex A to letter (2) we disagree; and it is clearly evident
you have elected to ignore the content of our notice and/or missed the crux of the issue entirely.
The facts of the matter remain as follows:
•
You took 48 calendar days longer than the reply required by date to reply to RFI/0401/17445.
•
The original response failed to address the matter which the RFI was raised for in the first place;
i.e. the provision and/or confirmation of the setting-out/coordinates of the S10 Lighting Fixtures.
•
You then issued us a Rev. 1 response to RFI/0401/17445 a further 36 calendar days later.
•
When the Rev. 1 response to RFI/0401/17445 was eventually received, it was found that the S10
lighting fixtures were to be relocated and distributed inside the landscape/planters area rather than on
the edge of the planters, as shown on the IFC Drawings; i.e. the position had changed.
•
However, all of S10 Lighting Fixtures have already been procured, fabricated and delivered to
site together with the 1.5 metre cable and the attached IP gland. Moreover, the installation of the
conduits and pull boxes to the perimeter of the planters, have also been completed on site.
•
Your Rev. 1 response to RFI/0401/17445 attempts to vary the design and requires an Engineer’s
Instruction (EI) and a Variation Order in order for us to integrate this change into the Works.
Hence this does not fall under the provisions of SAA8 Clause 2.24.2.1, nor can it be construed as such.
In view of this, then we maintain all our rights under the provision of Conditions of Contract Sub-Clauses
16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to the Time
for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event described in letter ref: (2).
Yours faithfully,
