Dear Sir,

The Contractor refers to the Engineer's Instruction ("El") No 89 received by the Contractor via reference
1 on 13 September 2015.

The Contractor considers that El No 89, which has been issued pursuant to General Condition ("GC")
13.1.1, may cause the Contractor to incur additional costs and potential delay to the Time(s) for
Completion.

Accordingly, the Contractor hereby notifies the Engineer's Assistant of the Contractor's intention to
claim for its entitlement (1) for any extensions to the Time(s) for Completion for any delays that may be
incurred due to El No 89 and, (2) for payment of any additional costs that may be incurred due to El No
89, all in accordance with GC 8.4.2 and GC 20.1.2 of Volume 3 of the Contract.

Please rest assured however that, notwithstanding the above, the Contractor will endeavour to mitigate
any delays and additional costs incurred due to El No 89 in accordance with its contractual obligations .

Yours faithfully,
