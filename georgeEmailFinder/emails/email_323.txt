Subject:SAA8 Sub-Clause 2.26: E-Notice No. 0156
Engineer’s Overdue Response to Operation & Maintenance Manual Submittal No.
OMM/0401/0119 Rev. 02 - Baggage Handling System (BHS)
Dear Sir,
Pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.26 of the Settlement Agreement and Amendment No. 8 (‘SAA8’), we hereby
submit this notice (‘E-Notice’) in consideration that the events and / or circumstances described in
Annex A may cause delay and/or disruption to the Works, and seek your swift resolution of the same.
Overview
The matters described in Annex A concern potential delays to the Works due to your failure to respond
to OMM/0401/0119 Rev. 02 within the review time expressly stipulated in the Contract.
Potential Impact
Delay and disruption due to the events and circumstances outlined herein at this stage of the Project is
likely to impact on achievement of Milestones MS9B and MS9C (Substantial Completion).
Action Required:
We therefore request your prompt action, guidance, decision or further instruction as applicable to
resolve the matters referenced herein in order to mitigate such delay and/or disruption to the Works.
Specifically we urge you to review and respond to our submittal without further undue delay. Kindly
ensure that such matters are actioned immediately upon receipt of this e-notice.
Meanwhile, we hereby reserve all our rights under the provisions of the Conditions of Contract SubClauses 16.5.2 and 27.1.1 [which have not been amended by SAA8 Sub-Clause 1.1] to an extension to
the Time for Completion and any associated costs arising from the event(s) described herein.
ANNEX A
Description of the Event
On 26 May 2019, we issued Submittal No. OMM/0401/0119 Rev. 02 [dated 22 May 2019] in the manner
shown in Table 1 below, seeking your approval of the Operation and Maintenance Manual for the
Baggage Handling System(BHS) for the Project, as described and detailed therein.

Baggage Handling System - Operation &
Maintenance Manual 2-Jun-19

Article 1.3 of Specification Section 013300 ‘Submittal Procedures’ governs the processing time by which
you are contractually obligated to respond to our Submittals. On the basis that Operation and
Maintenance Manual Submittal No: OMM/0401/0119 is shown to be at Rev. 02, then this ought to have
been responded to by you 7 calendar days later, i.e. on or before 2 June 2019. However, Table 1
indicates that at the cut-off date associated with the preparation of this Notice (i.e. 8 October 2019),
you exceeded and are continuing to exceed the review period expressly stipulated in the Contract by
128 calendar days. This is unacceptable, particularly at this stage of the Project.
Potential Impact:
The overdue response to Operation and Maintenance Manual Submittal No: OMM/0401/0119 Rev. 02
has directly affected our ability to complete the Baggage Handling Systems Works and associated works
such as delaying testing and commissioning. Notwithstanding the impact on Milestone MS07, this will
continue to impact upon our ability to achieve Milestone MS09B and similarly if your long overdue
response continues to remain outstanding, may delay achievement of Milestone MS09C.
We should also add that all our rights and entitlements to recover the associated additional time and
costs resulting from the aforementioned act(s) of prevention on your part will apply irrespective of any
alleged failure on our part [which is denied], to transmit submittals to you in a timely manner.
Yours faithfully,
