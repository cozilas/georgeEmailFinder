* Total quantities recalculated from previous notifications as per Chadwick’s weekly reporting
As stated in previous notices there has been an abject failure on your part to meet your target
completion programmes of June and October 2018. This failure continues unabated in relation to the
revised target completion dates shared in your email of December 2018. In addition, some of the
proposed completion dates continue not be in accordance with your procurement and delivery
schedules. Illustrative examples of this are the south infill or the wrapper roofs.
We note that all areas have suffered delays and failed target completion. Please refer to the table
enclosed under Appendix 1 wherein we have compared the different target completion dates proposed
by you during the last six months. This table is self-explanatory. You have been systematically
postponing your targets and have made no apparent effort to attempt to mitigate/recover the
slippages. Despite previous requests for information, some completion targets remain unknown to us.
We reiterate that your target failures are due to your inability to maintain the productivity rates
required to fulfil your own programmes and your mismanagement of your supply chain. In particular,
EFP whose late ACP deliveries continue to delay the completion for pier 3, wrapper roofs, gatehouses
and CP soffit. We must emphasise that choosing a sole ACP supplier was your own erroneous
procurement strategy for which you will be held responsible. We also note that the EFP supply shortfalls
have, to some extent, also been compounded by your own mismanagement of the engineering process
as evidence by the summary production table included hereafter:

In addition to the programme and procurement failures, there is also an ongoing concern pertaining to
the non-fulfilment of your QA/QC obligations. Circa 750 no. rejected WIRs are still outstanding despite
numerous letters instructing you to address the matter. Moreover, you have also failed to reconcile the
circa 600+ rejected MIRs outstanding. We urge you to address this without further delays.
In view of the current progress, and in the absence of any mitigation measures implemented by you thus
far, please be notified that, in our opinion, the performance of the installation works is such that it may
result in us not achieving our own obligations under the Contract. Therefore, you are requested to take
all reasonable steps to ensure completion of these works in accordance with your contractual
obligations under Sub-Clause 8.1.2 and Sub-Clause 16.1.1 of the Conditions of Subcontract.
Finally, please be notified that our rights under the provisions of Sub-Clause 10.3 [Contractor’s Claims]
and Sub-Clause 16.6 [Delay Damages] of the Conditions of Subcontract are reserved.
Yours faithfully,
