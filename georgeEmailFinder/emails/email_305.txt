We refer to the above cited letters and have reviewed their contents.

to achieve contractual Milestones: in this respect we would direct you to our various Delay
Notices and to our consolidated delay analyses numbers TIA 1 &2 issued on 30 June and. 9
October 2019. '
We note the content of your closing paragraphs and would record that in these instances the

respect of your prolonged costs.
Yours faithfully,
