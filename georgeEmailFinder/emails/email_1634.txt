Dear Sir,

The Consultant is hereby instructed to proceed with the implementat ion of the Engineer's Instruction
(E.I.) no.86 regarding changes in the design of the entrance 1.2 at Bin Mahmoud Station as detailed in
the enclosed letters under reference 1).

However, since this matter has already been instructed pursuant to Sub-Clause 4.4 [Variations] of the
Agreement under letter reference 2) and is already included within the Consultant's FCN 071, this
instruction does not have any further impact on the Consultant's design development.

We remain at your disposal for any further information and/or clarification.
Yours faithfully,
