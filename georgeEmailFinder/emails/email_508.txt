Dear Sir,
Further to our enclosed email correspondences and your letters referenced (1 and 2) above informing us
about the lack of workfronts resulting from the slow progress of M/s Gulf Precast (GPC), we inform you
that we have taken action regarding this matter and have informed GPC about your concerns.
As a result, we hereby enclose marked-up drawings showing the release dates of workfronts, which
have already been made available or will be made available by GPC, to proceed with your works.
We always remain available to assist you by all possible means to progress in all areas satisfactorily. This
can be established by means of continuous communication with our construction team and other
Subcontractors, to ensure the timely commencement and completion of the works.
We trust you find the aforementioned self-explanatory and clarifies the matter. Should the need arise
for any further clarification on the matter, kindly do not hesitate to contact us.
Yours faithfully,
