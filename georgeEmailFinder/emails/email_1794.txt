Dear Sir,
Engineer's Assistant refers to letter 1) referenced above, wherein the Contractor was requested to
submit a quotation under Sub-Clauses 13.2.1 & 13.2.2. Despite letters 2) & 3) referenced above, the
Contractor's continued delay in providing the quotation is preventing the Engineer to make an informed
decision under the Sub-Clause 13.2.3.

The Engineer will not consider any abortive costs or delay to the Time for Completion arising, directly or
indirectly as a result of the Contractor's failure to comply with obligations under Volume 3, Clause 13
Right to Vary'.

Any further delay on the part of the Contractor to provide a quotation will result in the Engineer having
to concludeIhat the Contractor is unwilling to comply with Clause 13 'Right to Vary' where the Engineer
will proceed C\Ccordingly under the Contract.
