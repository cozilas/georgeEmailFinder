Subject: Overdue Payments for CCC Staff at MTB Project
Dear Sir,
We in MTB project have been disappointed since 2016 because we were promised by our line managers
to get promotions, increments, and incentives; however because of the company situation all the

aforementioned was suspended. Over and above, the make-up and cost index were also removed this
year.
All that being said, we stood loyal alongside the company in its hardships, therefore we are kindly
expecting no less than the same in return. We are seeking your assistance because we reached a
breaking point that some employees have eviction notices, and some have their kids kicked out of
school for unpaid tuition fees, and some have court cases with the banks for overdue unpaid credit
cards and loans, moreover, the interests are being accumulated more.
In addition to the above, our medical insurance has been suspended without notice since beginning of
November leaving us and our families exposed to illness in this critical time with no money for
treatment.
We are sure you would not accept this suffering upon your family, so kindly understand the unbearable
situation we are facing.
We demand clarity and transparency from our company regarding our salaries and unpaid dues because
our financial situation is worsening which has adverse effect on our work and our personal life.
We already raised our concerns several times to MTB Board Member "Eimert Los" and Regional Area
Manager "George Haddad" through meetings however the only answer was "be patient and wait" which
we have already been doing since the beginning of the year.
This is not the first time the world goes through a crisis, nor the last. We are, as CCC MTB staff, the 2nd
and 3rd generation employees working for this company, and previously our fathers, relatives, and
friends all worked with your late father Muallem Saeed Khoury (God bless his soul) but they never went
through a similar tragedy like ours.
Nevertheless, we believe this issue will not be resolved without your personal and immediate
interference to end our agonies by paying all the back log the company owes us at the earliest. We are
approaching you as our last trust within the company, and none of us intend to approach external
channels like other employees with similar situation in other companies such as (media, courts ... etc.)
The following is the due payments we are owed by the company that we need immediately to survive:
2 Nos. basic salaries with allowances (September and October)
3 Nos. accommodation allowances (August, September and October)
1 No. schooling allowance (1st half of 2020)
End of Service Entitlements for staff released since May 2020 onwards
We at CCC have always had unlimited faith and loyalty to our company as per the CCC Owners principle
"We are a Family Company". We kindly request you to aid us in these difficult times.
Yours faithfully,
