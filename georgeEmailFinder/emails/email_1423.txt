Dear Sir,

Further to the Contractor's formal Claim No.021 interim submission issued under cover of reference 2,
the Contractor hereby confirms that in this month, September 2015, there is currently no additional
information available to vary or alter the August 2015 interim submission.

The Contractor shall keep the situation under review over the next month and will advise the Engineer's
Assistant of any changes and/or developments with respect to Claim No. 021 within October 2015
monthly update.

Claim No. 021 September 2015 monthly update (in accordance with Sub-Clause 20.1.6 of the General
Conditions of the Contract) is therefore as per the August 2015 interim submission.
Yours faithfully,
