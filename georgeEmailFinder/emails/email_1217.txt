Subject Submission of Contractor's Claims (HoA) Update 2
Dear Sir,
We write with reference to the above letters {1) to {6) regarding the Contractor's commitment to
finalize the ascertainment of its Subcontractor's cost by 15 May 2017. According to our records and as of
COB 15 May 2017, we have been notified of the readiness of around 9 submissions out of the required
twenty two submissions. We record that to date the submissions have not been made in a gradual
manner and within the agreed timeframe. We highlight that the Contractor's failure in meeting the
agreed date as well as its failure to follow the agreed process for the submissions
jeopardizes the Engineer's review and may affect the completion of the assessment.
We note your letter {7) which we received an advanced copy of on 15 May 2017(email copy attached)
and note that you advise of further delays in the receipt of the remaining outstanding submissions.
Consequently, the Contractor is required as a matter of urgency to inform the Engineer and the
Employer when the outstanding cost substantiation is going to be submitted.
We further advise that until such time the full submissions are made and review of the Engineer is
conducted, we will not be in a position to review the report contained within your letter {7) above as the
supporting submissions remain outstanding.
Yours faithfully,
