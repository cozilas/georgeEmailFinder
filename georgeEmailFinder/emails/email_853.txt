Subject: Re: Communication Protocol
Dear Sir,
The Contractor responds to the Engineer's letter ref (1) as follows:
At the outset, the Contractor once again asserts that it has never encouraged nor condoned direct
communication from Subcontractors to the Employer and/or the Engineer. Therefore, the Contractor
has
instructed the Subcontractor, Guinault-Lebrun Aircraft Power Systems LLC (GL), to remove their
Operations Manager from the Site, due to his failure to comply with the Project's communication
protocol.
Furthermore, the Contractor is now able to comment on the content of GL's letter ref (4), as the
Engineer
has now provided the Contractor with a copy of the letter. In this instance it seems, from reading GL's
letter ref (4), that the Employer in a meeting held in September 2017, intimated that if GL faced any
major
issues in completing their works, GL should contact the Employer directly. The Engineer is aware that
the
Contractor and therefore its Subcontractors and suppliers are facing cash flow problems. Thus, GL has
directly written to the Employer advising the Employer of this major issue.
The Contractor's assertion that the receipt of GL's letter ref (5) was acceptable to the Employer and the
Engineer was based on the information available to the Contractor. Please be advised that the
Contractor

did not have a copy of the Employer' s letter ref (6) until the Engineer appended it to letter ref (1).
The Contractor's assertion that "there is a form of direct contract/agreement between the Employer and
GL ", is based on the warranty arrangement which is to form a collateral contract between the Employer
and GL.
We trust the above clarifies the matter.
Yours faithfully,
