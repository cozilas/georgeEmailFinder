Dear Sir,
Further to our letter referenced in (4) above, kindly find enclosed herewith M/s PCEJV letter referenced
in (5) which is self-explanatory and is responding to your “Damage Notice” referenced in (3) above.
You are requested to provide your comments with clear and adequate evidence demonstrating that M/s
PCEJV and its Subcontractor, M/s Naffco are responsible for the damages to your works.
We are also taking this opportunity to remind you of your obligations under the Subcontract Clauses
15.6.2 [Passing of risk and title], 24.2.1 and 24.2.2 [Subcontractor’s Care of the Subcontract Works], to
protect your works until such a time as ownership of the same transfers to the Employer upon Taking
Over Certificate. Additionally, you are reminded to implement strict preventive measures in order to
avoid such incidents and delays in the future.
This is for your information and necessary action.
Yours faithfully,
