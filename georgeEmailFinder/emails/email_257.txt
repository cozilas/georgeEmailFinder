Dear Sir,
We write with reference to correspondence (1) wherein you provided us with your assessment pursuant
to Clause 27.1.6 of the Conditions of Contract of our ‘Consolidated Delay Analysis for events between 2
May 2019 and 1 August 2019’ issued under cover of our letter dated 9 October 2019 (2).
Our response to your assessment (which for ease of reading has maintained the same structure and
nomenclature as yours) is provided in ANNEX A.
We contend that the detailed responses provided within ANNEX A demonstrate that each of the delay
notices relied upon by us provide a valid basis of entitlement for an extension of the Time for
Completion. Furthermore, to the extent that we may not have fully complied with every procedural
requirement set down in the Contract, Clause 27.1.9 provides that this should not prevent you from
assessing our claim .
We suggest that after you have had an opportunity to digest the responses provided within the ANNEX
A, it would be beneficial for our respective claims team members to meet in an endeavour to progress
our claim for an extension of the Time for Completion.
Yours faithfully,
