Subject: Elevator Shaft Incident in Pier 3 Elv-03-17 on 10 December 2018
Dear Sir,
We refer to the incident took place in the elevator shaft Pier 3 Elv-03-17, and enclose the incident
report, our assessment and action plan.
We believe the causes of the incident and possible consequences are well understood and mitigation
measures are taken to prevent a similar incident from happening. The involved personnel had been
suspended from 12 December onwards, until the investigation is concluded.
Following our assessment, we decided current disciplinary action (suspension 12 days) is adequate
and TCAJV's involved engineer shall return to duty, under the conditions stated in our assessment
and action plan.
We will share an update in 2 weeks' time on the actions committed.
Accordingly, we consider the matter addressed and closed.
Yours faithfully,
