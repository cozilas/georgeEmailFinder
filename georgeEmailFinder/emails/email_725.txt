Re: Contractorâ€™s Instructions - Omission of Glass Doors (11 No.)

Dear Sir,
We acknowledge receipt of your substantiation documents vide letter referenced in (7) above for your
VO proposal as requested in our letter referenced in (6) above. However, our queries were not properly
addressed as described below:
1)
You submitted three (3) unapproved Shop Drawings and this clearly shows that the drawings
were not yet submitted or approved by the date the CI for the omission was issued. Failure to provide
such evidence will result in rejecting your claim for abortive cost for Engineering.
2)
You submitted Proforma Invoices, whereas we require actual Invoices with proof of payment to
substantiate the abortive cost of hardware. This is in addition to the delivery notes and approved
Material Inspection Requests for such hardware, to prove that the hardware was already purchased and
delivered to site by the time of the CI issuance.
In light of above, you are again reminded to expedite the submission of proper substantiation as
indicated above within seven (7) days of receipt of this letter.
This is for your attention and immediate action.
Yours faithfully,
