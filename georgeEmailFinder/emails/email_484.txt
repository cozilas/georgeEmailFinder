Re: Violation of ADDC's Regulations- LV Building Wires Joints (21 FDB's)

Dear Sir,
We are in receipt of your letter referenced (1) above, wherein you raised concerns about the
performance of our electrical works Subcontractor (M/s Anel) with respect to the on-site installation
activities. In your mentioned letter, inter alia, you have also requested the removal from the site of
Anel’s site supervisor Mr. Bonefacio Joaquin.
Please note that we have forwarded your letter and requested our Subcontractor to comply with your
request accordingly. In this regard, Anel responded via letter referenced (2) enclosed herewith,
requesting the Engineer’s reconsideration on the matter. Consequently, as stated in the enclosed letter,
Anel suggests that Mr. Bonefacio is not removed, as he has knowledge of the project and is an important
resource to the wire verification works.
In view of the above, we are of the opinion that Anel’s request is fair and reasonable. Therefore, we
believe it is in the best interest of all parties that Anel’s request is taken into consideration by the
Engineer and the removal of Mr. Bonefacio is reconsidered.
We trust that you will be in agreement with Anel’s request and that you will kindly reconsider their
request accordingly, as it is in the best interests of all parties.
We look forward to receiving your response on the matter.
Yours faithfully,
